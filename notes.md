# üß† `NewsSummary` ‚Äì Query-Aware Financial News Summarizer

The `NewsSummary` class provides an intelligent pipeline to fetch and summarize financial news based on a user query using LangChain, Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`), and Tavily.

---

## ‚úÖ Pipeline Logic

### 1. **Query Refinement**
- Accepts conversation history and the latest user message.
- Uses an LLMChain (`self.query_chain`) to turn the input into a high-precision search query.
- Example prompt:
  > "Refine this user query into a high-precision web search query..."

### 2. **Search Results Retrieval**
- Uses `TavilySearchResults` tool to perform the web search based on the refined query.
- Extracts URLs of top results.

### 3. **Web Document Loading**
- Loads full HTML content of the retrieved URLs using `WebBaseLoader`.
- Converts them into `Document` objects for downstream processing.

### 4. **Query-Aware Summarization (Map-Reduce)**
- Utilizes LangChain‚Äôs `load_summarize_chain` with `map_reduce` strategy.
  
#### üî∏ Map Prompt
- Each chunk of the document is summarized **in context of the query**.
- Irrelevant details are skipped.

#### üî∏ Reduce Prompt
- Aggregates all chunk summaries into a final, focused answer relevant to the query.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Methods

- `generate_query(history, latest_message)`  
  ‚Üí Returns a refined search query based on user input.

- `search_with_agent(query)`  
  ‚Üí Returns list of URLs from Tavily based on refined query.

- `load_documents(urls)`  
  ‚Üí Loads and returns parsed documents from given URLs.

- `handle_news_summary(history, latest_message)`  
  ‚Üí Orchestrates the entire pipeline: query ‚Üí search ‚Üí load ‚Üí summarize.

## üìù Example Output

```python
[
  "User: What's the latest update on Paytm's financial situation?",
  ...
]

‚Üí "Paytm received a FEMA violation notice regarding past acquisitions. The company also expanded international UPI support..."




# üß† Financial News Summarizer

This system intelligently summarizes financial news based on a user's query by combining web search, document loading, and LLM-powered summarization. It is implemented using **LangChain**, **Google Gemini (`gemini-2.0-flash`)**, and **Tavily Search**.

---

## üìå Objective

To build a **context-aware**, **query-guided** pipeline that:
1. Refines vague user questions into focused web search queries.
2. Searches and retrieves **real-time, relevant financial articles**.
3. Downloads and parses web content.
4. Summarizes it in a **concise, query-specific** manner using LLMs.

## üîÑ System Architecture & Pipeline

### 1. **Query Understanding and Refinement**
- Uses a custom `LLMChain` with a structured prompt.
- Takes user history and latest message to craft a **high-precision search query**.
- This ensures relevance and removes ambiguity in search.

### 2. **Web Search Tool Integration**
- Invokes `TavilySearchResults` (a LangChain tool).
- Returns the **top 10 most relevant URLs** matching the refined query.

### 3. **Document Acquisition**
- URLs are passed to `WebBaseLoader`, which:
  - Downloads web pages.
  - Extracts meaningful content.
  - Converts each page into LangChain-compatible `Document` objects.

### 4. **Query-Aware Summarization**
- Leverages LangChain‚Äôs `map_reduce` summarization method:
  
  **Map Phase:**
  - Each document chunk is summarized **with the query in mind**.
  - Unrelated content is ignored.

  **Reduce Phase:**
  - Combines all partial summaries into one final answer.
  - Focuses only on query-relevant insights and discards fluff.

---

## üß† Design Philosophy

- **LLM-Oriented Reasoning**: Query refinement, document evaluation, and summarization all rely on prompt-engineered LLM steps.
- **Composable Pipelines**: Each stage is modular, enabling flexible reuse (e.g., replacing the search tool or LLM).
- **Non-LLM + LLM Integration**: Bridges traditional tools (web scraping, search APIs) with LLMs seamlessly.
- **Query-Aware Processing**: Summarization isn't generic ‚Äî it's always guided by the user‚Äôs intent.
