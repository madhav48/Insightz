Paperfiat currencyonly represents a promise to pay the bearer in physical money upon redemption.\n\nHard money maintains a stable market value relative to goods and services and a strong exchange rate relative to foreign currencies. Due to its stability in goods and financial markets, hard money fulfills the economic function of money as amedium of exchange, astore of value, and aunit of account.\n\nHard money involves lower transaction costs and risks than soft money. This distinction originated when comparing the metallic content and confidence in the metallic standard of commodity money and carried over to comparing variousmodern paper or fiat monies.\n\nBecause the value of paper currencies fluctuates on theforex market, according to confidence in the promises of payment that they represent, and declines in value over time as issuers inflate their supply, \"hard\" versus \"soft\" money also became associated with the relative stability ofexchange ratesof certain national currencies.\n\nIn the absence of metallic monies, hard money can refer to other monetary instruments that behave more like metallic money in domestic and international markets.
