  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA cottage industry is a small manufacturing operation, often run out of a home by a single individual or a family.\n\nA cottage industry is a small manufacturing business that's owned and operated by an individual or a family and typically operates out of the family home rather than a purpose-built facility.\n\nCottage industries are defined by the small investment that's required to start one. They often focus on producing labor-intensive goods. They can be at a significant disadvantage when competing with manufacturers ofmass-producedgoods.\n\nThe first cottage industries in the U.S. and Europe were light manufacturing operations that engaged insubcontractedwork including garment-making, textiles, sewing, shoemaking, and small machine parts.\n\nThese cottage industries produced finished goods, often using raw materials supplied by the contract provider. Many contemporary industries that operate in\u00a0factories in the developed world replaced cottage industries that thrived before theIndustrial Revolution.\n\nModern cottage industries serve a consumer market that seeks original, handcrafted products as an alternative to mass-produced, name-brand products. These include anything from clothing and rugs to honey and spices.\n\nProducts created by cottage industries in the U.S. and Europe can often be found at flea markets and farmers' markets.\n\nCottage industries play a significant role in the economies of developing countries. They require very small investments to get off the ground.\n\nDeveloping nations havecomparative advantagesin creating successful cottage industries. Their lower cost of living makes it feasible to produce labor-intensive goods at competitive prices, allowing a small business to make a reasonable profit.\n\nSome cottage industries grow over time and employ others in the community. Their products tend to be handcrafted using traditional tools and machinery so their productivity is unlikely to rival the sheer volume of the products of mass manufacturing.\n\nCottage industries are also an important source of supplemental income in rural areas. Some farmers turn to their cottage industries to produce income when the growing season ends. A cottage industry in a village can grow over time as residents come together to produce crafts for sale in local markets\u00a0or for export.\n\nCottage industries can thrive if their operators are content to remain small producers in niche markets, working for the benefit of a single family. Business growth is possible but there are significant barriers.\n\nA cottage industry can be created with minimal startup costs by a single individual with a skill that's valued.\n\nOnly the most basic infrastructure is necessary. The business operator needs a way to receive orders, get supplies delivered, and get the end products to buyers. Mobile technology has greatly improved the ability of cottage industries to operate.\n\nCottage industries are creating opportunities for people in remote rural areas to improve their living standards even in modern times.\n\nCottage industries must compete with larger producers with deeper pockets. This may require them to adopt new technologies that improve productivity.\n\nThey must also compete for labor if they grow. This can be increasingly difficult as a country becomes more developed and wages increase.\n\nReliant on basic infrastructure to get products to market\n\nDifficulty in ramping up production to meet demand\n\nCompetition from larger producers\n\nSuccessful cottage industries often cater to groups of consumers who prefer hand craftsmanship to mass-produced goods. Others seek unique artisan goods. Some cottage industries focus on niche products that can't be manufactured economically, such as fine musical instruments, theatrical costumes, and metalwork.\n\nCottage industries are a huge contributor to India's economy, providing the skilled labor that goes into leather goods, cotton weaving, carpet making, metalwork, and silk weaving. The quality of their output is high, as are their prices.\n\nDemand for unique products drives much of the market for cottage industry goods in affluent economies. In the U.S., cottage industry workers are often artisans, using sites like Etsy and Amazon Handmade as well as local street fairs and flea markets to sell hand-crafted pottery, furniture, jewelry, decorative crafts, and more.\n\nNiche marketsthat don't attract big producers can be an ideal fit for cottage industries. Competitive dancers, figure skaters, and other performers at the higher levels of competition often wear original, handmade costumes. This creates a demand for highly skilled costume designers.\n\nCottage industries may be the original remote work system. They opened a way for people living in rural areas before the Industrial Revolution to make a living doing labor-intensive jobs such as spinning wool, tanning leather, and sewing clothing.\n\nThey were often subcontractors in modern terminology, finishing goods and sending them on to businesses that packaged them for shipment to suppliers and retailers.\n\nThis work was predominantly done in cottages in Europe and America, primarily by women who didn't have access to other trades or professions.\n\nTake a look at Etsy or Amazon Handmade for a comprehensive overview of the thousands of handmade products that are being created by skilled artisans working independently. Most are modern cottage industries.\n\nThis is going on all over the world, with many artisans focusing on traditional local skills. The top cottage industries in India are silk weaving, carpet making, leatherworking, metalworking, and specialty food processing.\n\nCottage industries aren't usually scalable by definition. They're no longer cottage industries once theyscale up.\n\nThe definition of success is different. Most cottage industries are intended to provide a decent income for a single individual or family.\n\nThere are the occasional breakout stars like Burt's Bees, which got its start when a fed-up photojournalist moved to rural Maine and became a beekeeper. But even Burt needed a partner with bigger ambitions.\n\nCottage industries thrived in the pre-industrial ages when people in remote areas were able to make a living, though hardly an easy one, by creating labor-intensive products for larger businesses.\n\nThey appear to be thriving in modern times as well as niche businesses pop up in homes all over the world to serve the demand for high-quality hand craftsmanship.\n\nLegal Raasta. \"Cottage Industries in India.\"",
