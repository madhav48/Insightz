  "term": "Life Income Fund (LIF): Definition and How Withdrawals Work",
  "definition": "A life income fund is a Canadian registered retirement income fund used to hold locked-in\u00a0pension funds as well as other assets for an eventual payout\u00a0as retirement income.\n\nA life income fund (LIF) is a type of\u00a0registered retirement income fund (RRIF)\u00a0in Canada that can be used to hold locked-in retirement accounts (LIRAs) and other assets for retirement income.\n\nA LIF is meant to live up to its name, and funds aren't to be withdrawn in a lump sum. Owners must use it to support retirement income. Regular updates to Canada's\u00a0Income Tax\u00a0Act set the minimum and maximum withdrawal amounts for RRIFs, which include LIFs, though these limits and other aspects of a LIF depend on the province in which the pension plan was set up.The annual maximums and minimums may account for your balances in other funds and annuities.\n\nWithdrawals from a LIF are taxed as income in the year they are received. In most provinces, you must convert your LIRA to a LIF by the end of the year when you turn 71.\n\nLIFs are offered by Canadian financial institutions. They are plans for managing payments fromlocked-inpension funds and other assets.\n\nIn many cases, pension assets aren't accessible when an employee leaves a firm. These assets, usually called locked-in, can be managed through other plans. However, you might need to move the funds into a LIF once you're ready to begin withdrawals.\n\nMost provinces in Canada require that LIF assets be invested in a life annuity. In many provinces, LIF withdrawals can begin at 50 if the income is used for retirement income.\n\nOnce you begin taking LIF payouts, you'll have to ensure you mean the minimum and maximum for each year. Your financial institution for the LIF will have this information, which is updated regularly through Canada's Income Tax Act and has sections that regulate all RRIFs. Thefinancial institutionfrom which the LIF is issued must give you annual statements for the LIF.\n\nBased on the annual statement, you must specify at the beginning of eachfiscal yearthe amount of income you would like to withdraw. This must be within a defined range to ensure the\u00a0account holds\u00a0enough funds to provide lifetime income for the LIF owner.\n\nQualified investments include cash, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, securities listed on a regulated exchange, corporate bonds, and government bonds.\n\nHere are some general rules about LIFs:\n\nSetting up a LIF has several advantages:\n\nThere are some disadvantages to setting up a LIF. They include the following:\n\nContributions grow tax-deferred within a LIF account\n\nLIF owners can choose their own investments (if the investments qualifies)\n\nFunds within a LIF are creditor-protected and can't be seized to pay off debt obligations\n\nContributions can grow tax-deferred until the year after you turn 71\n\nA minimum age requirement (early retirement age) before being able to start a LIF\n\nA minimum age requirement (early retirement or normal retirement age) before being able to receive LIF payments\n\nMaximum withdrawal limits prevent you from accessing more income when you need it\n\nOnly qualified investments can be held in a LIF account\n\nOAS and the CPP are both government-run pension programs in Canada. OAS is a universal pension that provides a monthly payment to eligible adults age 65 and older, whatever their work history. Eligibility is based on residency in Canada. The CPP is a contributory pension plan that provides retirement, disability, and survivor benefits based on contributions made during an individual's working years. While the amount received from CPP depends on contributions during a career, OAS benefits depend on the number of years lived in Canada after the age of 18.\n\nTFSAs and RRSPs are both savings vehicles with tax advantages, but they serve different purposes. Contributions to an RRSP are tax-deductible, which means they can reduce your taxable income for the year you contribute. Investments within an RRSP grow tax-deferred until withdrawn. Meanwhile, contributions to a TFSA are not tax-deductible, but any growth, withdrawals, and interest earned within the account are tax-free. TFSAs offer more flexibility since you can withdraw funds at any time without tax consequences, while RRSPs are designed to provide income during retirement.\n\nThere are different measures, and much depends not just on income and health outcomes but also on the standard of living one can have on that income. The cheapest countries in which to retire include Portugal, Panama, the Philippines, Malaysia, Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam.As for retirement systems, Mercer and the CFA Institute publish a global pension index ranking the top pension programs worldwide, and it tends to match other such rankings.\n\nTypically, as in 2023, the Netherlands takes the top spot in a group that includes Denmark, Iceland, and Israel, each with \"a first-class and robust retirement income system that delivers good benefits, is sustainable, and has a high level of integrity.\" Canada is given a \"B\" for its system, below those like Australia and Finland with a \"B+,\" but well ahead of the U.S.'s \"C+,\" which groups it among countries like Croatia, Kazakhstan, and Colombia. The worst-ranked are Argentina and the Philippines, among those included in the index.\n\nA LIF is a Canadian RRIF designed to provide retirement income from locked-in pension funds and other assets. LIFs are regulated by the Canadian government through the Income Tax Act, which sets the minimum and maximum annual withdrawal amounts. These funds can't be withdrawn from through a lump sum and are intended to provide a steady income stream throughout the retiree's lifetime.\n\nTo buy a LIF, you have to reach the early retirement age (typically 50) in provincial and federal pension legislation, and you must begin receiving payments by the end of the year after which you've turned 71. The funds within a LIF grow tax-deferred, and the account holder can choose from various qualified investments, such as mutual funds and bonds.\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Income Tax Act ( RSC , 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.)).\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C1, Qualified Investments \u2013 RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs, FHSAs and TFSAs.\"\n\nCanada Life. \"RRIF Withdrawal Rules.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Income Tax Folio S3-F10-C1, Qualified Investments \u2013 RRSPs, RESPs, RRIFs, RDSPs, FHSAs and TFSAs.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Canada Pension Plan.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Register a Deferred Profit Sharing Plan.\"\n\nSuperintendent of Financial Institution (Canada). \"Life Income Funds.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Pensions.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Old Age Security.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Pooled Registered Pension Plan.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Registered Retirement Income Fund.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Registered Retirement Savings Plan.\"\n\nGovernment of Canada. \"Tax-Free Savings Account.\"\n\nGroup Enroll. \"Life Income Fund (LIF) \u2013 How It Works?\"\n\nU.S. News & World Report. \"The Cheapest Places to Retire Abroad on $1k a Month.\"\n\nWorld Economic Forum. \"These Are the Best Countries To Retire In.\"\n\nMercer. \"Mercer-CFA Institute 2023 Global Pension Index.\"",
