  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nMagna cum laude is a Latin phrase that means \u201cwith great praise.\"\n\nMagna cum laude is a term used in academics to acknowledge that a student graduated with a grade point average (GPA) near the top of the class. In the U.S., there are three levels of academic distinction or Latin honors.Cum laude, meaning \"with distinction,\" magna cum laude, or \"with great praise,\" andsumma cum laude, or \"with highest distinction.\"\n\nThe awarding of Latin honors is common in colleges and universities in the United States. Latin honors are commonly awarded with bachelor's degrees. Students who graduate with honors may wear stoles of a distinct color or some other designation during commencement ceremonies, and their honors may be cited when their names are read. Magna cum laude is more prestigious than cum laude honors but less prestigious than summa cum laude.\n\nEach institution defines the criteria. Some use GPA while others calculate their honors according to class placement. For example, a student in the top 3% of the class might qualify for a magna cum laude distinction. Colleges may consider other factors in their decisions to grant magna cum laude status.\n\nAn institution might require that students complete an honors thesis to be eligible. Others seek letters of recommendation from faculty members. Some may require students to complete a certain number of advanced courses.\n\nLatin honors are generally noted in a student\u2019s official transcript.\n\nSome schools have substituted other titles, such as \u201cwith distinction,\u201d in place of or in addition to the traditional Latin terms.\n\nThe relative value of a magna cum laude degree or another Latin honor is difficult to judge as a factor in the job market. It may mean a great deal to some employers and nothing to others. It may benefit students competing for slots in graduate school. The top law schools, for example, expect students to have achieved certain GPAs as undergraduates\u2014the type of high marks that are often accompanied by Latin honors.\n\nGraduating with honors notes that an individual has shown exemplary performance at school, particularly in academics. It indicates that an individual is capable of performing at the highest level.\n\nA college degree is a great achievement, but a new graduate with honors may stand out in a crowded field of job seekers or graduate school applicants. Latin honors such as a magna cum laude distinction indicate a student has consistently performed at a high level.\n\nIndeed. \"Magna Cum Laude vs. Summa Cum Laude: What's the Difference?\"\n\nTexas A&M University, Aggie One Stop. \u201cGraduation With Honors.\u201d\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, Samueli School of Engineering, Office of Academic and Student Affairs. \u201cLatin Honors Eligibility.\u201d\n\nBrown University. \u201cThe College: Latin Honors (Magna Cum Laude).\u201d",
