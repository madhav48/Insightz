  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA term deposit is a fixed-interest savings instrument that can only be withdrawn after the term ends.\n\nA term deposit is a savings tool where money is deposited into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually have short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years, have varying levels of required minimum deposits, and pay a fixed interest rate to the investor.\n\nThe investor must understand when buying a term deposit that they can withdraw their funds only after the term ends. In some cases, the account holder may allow the investor early termination or withdrawal if they give several days' notice. Also, there will be a penalty assessed for early termination.\n\nExamples of term deposits includecertificates of deposit (CDs)andtime deposits.\n\nWhen an account holder deposits funds at a bank, the bank can use that money to lend to other consumers or businesses. In return for the right to use these funds for lending, they will pay the depositor compensation in the form of interest on the account balance.\n\nWith most deposit accounts of this nature, the owner may withdraw their money at any time. This makes it difficult for the bank to know ahead of time how much it may lend at any given time.\n\nTo overcome this problem, banks offer term deposit accounts. A customer will deposit or invest in one of these accounts, agreeing not to withdraw their funds for a fixed period in return for a higher rate of interest paid on the account.\n\nThe interest earned on a term deposit account is slightly higher than that paid on standard savings or interest-bearing checking accounts. The increased rate is because access to the money is limited for the term of the term deposit.\n\nTerm deposits are an extremely safe investment and are therefore very appealing to conservative, low-risk investors. The financial instruments are sold by banks, thrift institutions, andcredit unions. Term deposits sold by banks are insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).TheNational Credit Union Administration (NCUA)provides coverage for those sold by credit unions.\n\nIf a customer places money in a term deposit, the bank can invest the money in other financial products that pay a higherrate of return (RoR)than what the bank is paying the customer for the use of their funds.\n\nThe bank can also lend the money out to its other clients, thereby receiving a higher interest rate from the borrowers as compared to what the bank is paying in interest for the term deposit.\n\nFor example, a lender may offer a 2% rate for term deposits with a two-year maturity. The funds deposited are then structured as loans to borrowers who are charged 7% in interest on those notes.\n\nThis difference in rates means that the bank makes a net 5% return. The spread between the rate the bank pays its customers for deposits and the rate it charges its borrowers is called thenet interest margin. Net interest margin is a profitability metric for banks.\n\nBanks are businesses; as such, they want to pay the lowest rate possible for term deposits and charge a much higher rate to borrowers for loans. This practice increases their margins or profitability.\n\nHowever, there is a balance the bank needs to maintain. If it pays too little interest, it won't attract new investors into the term deposit accounts. Also, if they charge too high a rate on loans, it won't attract new borrowers.\n\nIn periods of rising interest rates, consumers are more likely to purchase term deposits since the increased cost of borrowing makes savings more attractive. Also, with higher market interest rates, the financial institution will need to offer the investor a higher rate of interest, so the investor also earns more.\n\nWhen interest rates decrease, consumers are encouraged to borrow and spend more, thereby stimulating the economy. In a low interest rate environment, demand for term deposits can decrease since investors can typically find alternative investment vehicles that pay a higher rate.\n\nTypically, interest rates should be proportional to the time until maturity and the minimum amount of principal lent to the credit union or bank. In other words, a six-month term deposit will likely pay a lower interest rate than a two-year term deposit.\n\nInvestors not only receive a higher rate for locking up their money with the bank for extended periods, but also earn a higher rate for large deposits. For example, ajumbo CD, which is a term deposit above $100,000, will receive a higher interest rate than a $1,000 CD.\n\nTerm deposits are also called certificates of deposit. Customers can view the conditions of the term deposit via a paper statement. This statement includes the required minimum principal amount, the interest rate paid, and the duration (or time to maturity), as agreed by the bank and the depositor.\n\nIf a customer wants to close a term deposit before the end of the term, or maturity, the customer will be subject to a penalty. This penalty may include the loss of any interest paid on the deposit account until that point. Closing the CD before the term ends lets the customer take back the principal amount invested, but with the forfeiture of the earned interest.\n\nThe penalty for withdrawing prematurely or against the agreement is stated at the time of opening a term deposit, as required by theTruth in Savings Act.\n\nSometimes, if interest rates have risen considerably, it might be worth it for a customer to close the term deposit early, take the penalty for the early withdrawal, and reinvest the funds elsewhere at a higher rate.\u00a0It's important to be sure that the alternative rate is high enough to more than compensate for the original rate on the term deposit plus the cost of the penalty.\n\nWhen a term deposit is nearing its maturity date, the bank holding the deposit will usually send a letter notifying the customer of the upcoming maturity. In the letter, the bank will ask if the customer wants the deposit renewed again for the same length to maturity.\n\nThe rollover will likely be at a different rate based on the market interest rate at that time. Alternatively, the customer has the option of placing the funds in another financial product.\n\nInvestors holding retirement CDs should speak to a financial planner or tax advisor who can explain the different regulations involved in early withdrawal from these investments.\n\nUnfortunately, term deposits do not keep up with inflation. Theinflation rateis a measure of how much prices rise in a given year. If the rate on a term deposit is 2% and the inflation rate in the U.S. is 2.5%, theoretically, the customer is not earning enough to compensate for price increases in the economy.\n\nRather than investing a large lump sum into one term deposit, an investor may use a strategy that spreads out the funds between several CDs. This strategy for investing using term deposits\u00a0is to distribute an investment evenly over a set number of years, with maturities coming at regular intervals.\n\nThisladdering investment strategylocks in the interest rates with the CDs at longer terms having higher rates than those with shorter terms. As the CDs mature, the customer can choose to use the money for income by withdrawing the funds or rolling those funds into another CD to continue the ladder. The method allows the investor to have access to funds as they mature.\n\nFor example, an investor can deposit $3,000 each into a five-year, four-year, three-year, two-year, and one-year term deposit. One of the CDs matures each year, which allows the customer to either withdraw the money for expenses or roll the funds into a new account.\n\nThe new term deposit will have a rate based on the current market rate. This method is popular for retirees who need to withdraw a set amount of income each year from their savings to pay for living expenses.\n\nThe strategy can be used while investing with the same credit union or bank, or across several different institutions. The investor can either withdraw the principal and interest upon maturity or reinvest the funds if they are not needed.\n\nTerm deposits offer a fixed rate of interest over the life of the investment.\n\nTerm deposits are risk-free, safe investments since they're either backed by the FDIC or the NCUA.\n\nVarious maturities allow investors to stagger end-dates to create an investment ladder.\n\nTerm deposits have a low minimum deposit amount.\n\nTerm deposits pay higher rates for larger initial deposit amounts.\n\nInterest rates paid on term deposits are typically lower or less attractive than most fixed-rate investments.\n\nTerm deposits can't be withdrawn early without penalty or losing all of the interest earned.\n\nInterest rates don't keep up with rising inflation.\n\nInterest rate risk exists if investors are locked in a low-rate term deposit while overall interest rates are rising.\n\nWells Fargo Bank(WFC)is one of the largest consumer banks in the U.S. and offers several types of term deposits. Below are a few of the bank's CDs along with the interest rates paid to depositors as of May 28, 2025:\n\nPlease note that the interest rates being offered by the bank can change anytime for new CDs and might be different depending on the state in which the branch is located.\n\nAdditionally, the three-month, six-month, and one-year CDs have the same rates on this day because the inverted yield curve and expectations of falling interest rates have led banks to offer similar short-term returns regardless of term length.\n\nA term deposit is giving your money to a bank to keep safe for a set period, such as six months or a year. While your money is stored at the bank, you cannot touch it for the specified period; otherwise, early withdrawals may incur a penalty.\n\nThe bank holds onto your money, and at the end of the period, gives it back to you plus an additional amount. That additional amount is interest.\n\nThe amount of interest you receive is more than you would at a traditional savings account because the bank knows it can lend out your money with more certainty since you won't withdraw it at any given moment. Generally, the longer you keep it locked up, the more interest they'll pay.\n\nIf you have extra cash on hand that you won't need for a while, a term deposit is a simple, low-risk way to store your money and earn more interest on it than you would in a traditional savings account.\n\nTerm deposits are particularly beneficial if you're seeking a fixed return and aren't interested in the volatility of the stock market. Just ensure you won't need the money for the specified lock-up period, otherwise you may lose out on some of the interest if you take it out early. Term deposits are good for longer-term financial planning than for last-minute spending.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of a term deposit is that you can't access your money for the specified period; otherwise, you may have to pay an early withdrawal penalty. It's best used when you're 100% certain you won't need the money. Also, you can't add more money to your term deposit, so it's not the best way of adding to your savings.\n\nDetermining what is \"better\" than a term deposit will depend on the specific investor. If you are looking for higher interest than a savings account and don't need to access your money, a term deposit is a good fit. If you're not sure if you will need your money in the near future but want to earn a little interest on it, a regular savings account may be a better option.\n\nAnother good alternative is a high-yield savings account. This type of account generally comes with no time or withdrawal restrictions, usually pays more interest than both a term deposit (depending on the specifics) and a savings account, and you can add to the balance at any time.\n\nA certificate of deposit (CD) is a type of term deposit. Term deposits are savings accounts where you store your money for a fixed period of time and earn interest. You cannot remove your money for that period lest you pay a penalty. \"Term deposit\" is the general term, and depending on the region, is used in place of \"certificate of deposit.\"\n\nHaving extra cash on hand is a nice position to be in. If you find yourself in such a situation, a term deposit is a good way to earn some interest on your cash that will pay you more than a savings account while remaining safe, simple, and low-risk.\n\nThe longer the term deposit, generally the more money you'll earn; just be careful that you won't need that money for the lock-up time of the term deposit, otherwise you may incur some penalties.\n\nWhile the rate may not beat inflation, term deposits are a good option for conservative savers who want to diversify their returns and avoid the ups and downs of the stock market.\n\nState of Connecticut, Department of Banking. \"ABC's of Banking.\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"National Rates and Rate Caps.\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Are My Deposit Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\"\n\nNational Credit Union Administration. \"Share Insurance Coverage.\"\n\nCode of Federal Regulations. \"12 CFR Part 1030-Truth In Savings (Regulations DD).\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"What Is a Certificate of Deposit (CD) Rollover or Renewal?\"\n\nWells Fargo. \"Savings Account and CD (Time Account) Rates.\"",
