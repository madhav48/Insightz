  "term": "What Is a Living Trust?",
  "definition": "A living trust is a legal arrangement used in estate planning to hold and protect an individual's assets and direct their distributions after death,\n\nA living trust is a legal arrangement established by an individual, referred to as the grantor, during their lifetime. It protects their assets and directs their distributions after the grantor's death. It's an estate planning tool that can help family members and beneficiaries avoid a lengthy, public, complex, and sometimes costlyprobateprocess. Atrusteeis designated by the grantor as the individual or entity who will control these assets for the benefit of the beneficiaries at a certain point.\n\nLiving trusts are significant in that they allow a trustee to manage the assets in the trust and transfer them to beneficiaries after the grantor\u2019s death. The grantor often acts as trustee of a revocable trust and manages the assets during their lifetime, naming a successor trustee in the trust document to take over management and distribute the assets after their death.\n\nLiving trusts begin with the establishment of a trust instrument during the lifetime of the grantor. This is a legal document that lays out the rules and provisions of the trust. Those arranging for a living trust often work with an experienced estate planning professional to ensure proper setup due to the importance and potential complexity of this document.\n\nThe grantor decides whatassetsshould be placed in the trust and transfers title to those assets into the trust when it's been created. They're then managed by the grantor or a named trustee who typically has a fiduciary duty to manage the trust prudently and in the best interests of the trust's beneficiaries. The beneficiaries are designated by the grantor when they create the living trust.\n\nThese assets flow to the beneficiaries according to the grantor's wishes as outlined in the trust agreement upon the death of the grantor. A living trust itself can be named the beneficiary of certain assets that would otherwise flow directly to the named beneficiary regardless of what's stated in a will.\n\nA living trust takes effect while the grantor is living, unlike awill. The trust doesn't have to go through probate for assets to reach the intended beneficiaries when the grantor\u00a0dies or becomes incapacitated.\n\nOwnership of assets must be assigned to a living trust to be covered by its terms. They're re-titled to indicate ownership by the trust. Assets that can be assigned to or fund a trust include real estate such as land, commercial property, and homes or financial accounts. They can include personal property such as jewelry, artwork, antiques, or even business interests. Specific financial accounts and items can include:\n\nIt's not recommended that you put a 401(k) or IRA in a living trust because the IRS will see it as an early withdrawal if you change the title or ownership structure of an employer-sponsored retirement plan. You'd owe taxes on the amount in your account in the year the assignment takes place and you\u2019d also have to pay a 10% penalty for the early withdrawal if you're younger than age 59\u00bd.\n\nThe two primary types of living trusts are revocable and irrevocable.\n\nArevocable living trustis the most common type of living trust. The grantor can act as the trustee and maintain control over the assets placed within it. They maintain the power to change and amend the trust rules at any time. They can change beneficiaries, remove assets, or terminate the trust entirely.\n\nRevocable trusts are often used to protect the assets of the grantor should they become ill or otherwise unable to control them. The individual named as successor trustee will step in and make decisions for the grantor. Revocable living trusts become irrevocable upon the creator's death.\n\nTaxes owed on assets in a revocable trust are still paid by the grantor during their lifetime. Tax rates don't increase just because assets are placed within the trust.\n\nThe trust itself owns the assets and the grantor can't designate themself as the trustee of anirrevocable living trust. The grantor relinquishes certain rights of control over them and the trust. The trustee effectively becomes the legal owner.\n\nThe named beneficiaries\u00a0are set when the irrevocable trust is created and the grantor can do little to amend that agreement.\u00a0Trust provisions can only be changed in certain specific situations. Some changes may even require the approval of the courts. You can never take back the assets assigned to an irrevocable living trust.\n\nThere are benefits to establishing an irrevocable trust, however. It protects the assets within it from lawsuits and creditors, making them particularly useful to professionals who may be vulnerable to litigation such as doctors or attorneys.\n\nThe grantor can also reduce their taxable estate because the trust now owns the assets. They aren't taken into account for eligibility and costs for government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nIndividuals may find it useful to have both a living trust and a will because they perform different functions. A living trust goes into effect as soon as it's created and it serves to protect the assets it holds while a person is living. A will doesn't go into effect until the individual dies.\n\nAs with many legal issues, a living trust has its advantages but it has some disadvantages as well.\n\nSome significant legal distinctions exist between a living trust and a will.\n\nA living trust allows you to name beneficiaries and appoint a trustee to manage and distribute trust assets after your death. This lets your family avoid the intrusion of probate for property that's distributed by the trust and other matters related to your estate.\n\nSome individuals establish living trusts simply to avoid probate but they can be more complicated and costly to create than a will.\n\nA living trust can't designate an executor for a will to distribute any assets not included in them and it can't name guardians for minor children. Individuals who create living trusts usually draw up a will as well.\n\nA living trust takes effect immediately when it's created and signed and you can manage, control, and protect your assets throughout your lifetime if the trust is revocable and as long as you remain mentally competent. This control, via your instructions in the living trust document, will extend beyond your death to the distribution of the assets according to your instructions in the living trust document.\n\nA\u00a0will\u00a0is a legal document that names an executor to carry out your wishes after your death. It directs how your assets should be distributed by the executor. It also designates guardians for minor children and includes instructions for other things such as the payment of debts and taxes, debt forgiveness, and funeral arrangements.\n\nThe handling of a will and the distribution of assets it bequeaths involves the court-supervised process of probate. This is known to take a great deal of time and be potentially expensive. Matters relating to a will also become public when the probate court becomes involved.\n\nA will isn't a complicated document to create so it's less costly than a living trust. It requires a witness to your signature but no notary public although it's always a good idea to protect it with a notarization as well. It takes effect upon death or incapacitation.\n\nIt's a good idea to obtain the assistance of an estate lawyer to establish a living trust but you can take some preparatory steps on your own.\n\nNo. Aliving willis a directive written by an individual granting power of attorney and other rights to another trusted individual if they become incapacitated or lose the ability to communicate. A living orinter vivostrust establishes a legal entity that holds assets that can be distributed to beneficiaries without the necessity of probate after the grantor's death.\n\nEstablishing a living trust usually requires an attorney. It will probably cost between $1,500 and $3,000 in 2025 depending on the attorney and the complexities of your trust.\n\nThe downsides of a trust will depend on whether it's revocable or irrevocable. Arevocable trustisn't sheltered from tax authorities or creditors and this limits its usefulness for protecting assets while the grantor is still alive. An irrevocable trust involves forfeiting all ownership and control of the assets placed inside of it along with very little flexibility in how the trust can be directed after it's established.\n\nA living trust can be a very important legal arrangement for people with assets they want to control and protect during their lifetimes and beyond. It normally provides those who establish and fund them the power to control and benefit from their assets while living and direct how they should be distributed after they've died. Living trusts normally bypass the time-consuming and costly probate process and facilitate the smooth transfer of assets to beneficiaries.\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Successor Trustee.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Revocable Trusts.\"\n\nNorthwestern Mutual. \"Which Assets Belong in a Trust?\"\n\nFidelity. \"Trusts and Taxes: What You Need to Know.\"\n\nThe American College of Trust and Estate Counsel. \"ACTEC Estate Planning Essentials: Can I Change My Irrevocable Trust?\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Young Lawyers Network: Tax and Non-Tax Considerations when Drafting Irrevocable Trusts.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Introduction to Wills.\"\n\nCabot Wealth Network. \"How Much Does a Living Trust Cost and Is It Worth It?\"",
