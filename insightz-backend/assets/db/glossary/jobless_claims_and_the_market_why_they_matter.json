  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nJobless claims are a statistic reported weekly by the U.S. Department of Labor that counts people filing to receiveunemploymentinsurance benefits. There are two categories of jobless claims: initial, which comprises people filing for the first time, and continuing, which consists of unemployed people who have already been receiving unemployment benefits. Jobless claims are an importantleading indicatorof the state of the employment situation and the health of the economy.\n\nThe nation's jobless claims are an extremely important indicator for macroeconomic analysis. A weekly report\u00a0produced and published by theDepartment of Labor (DOL)tracks how many new people filed forunemployment benefitsin the previous week. As such, it is a good gauge of the U.S. job market. For instance, when more people file for unemployment benefits, it generally means fewer people have jobs, and vice versa.\n\nInvestors can use this report to form an opinion of the country's economic performance. However, it is often very volatile data because it is reported every week. The moving four-week average of jobless claims is often monitored rather than the weekly figure.\u00a0The report is released Thursday mornings at 8:30 a.m. ET and can be a market-moving event.\n\nThere were 219,000 initial jobless claims filed in the week ending Feb. 15, 2025, and about 1.87 million continuing claims during the week ending Feb. 8, 2025. The unemployment rate was 4% as of January 2025.\n\nAs mentioned, the initial jobless claims measure emerging unemployment and the continued claims data measure the number of people still claiming unemployment benefits. The continued claims data is released one week later than the initial claims. For this reason, the initial claims usually have a higher impact on the financial markets.\n\nMany financial analysts incorporate estimates of the report into their market forecast. If a weekly release on jobless claims comes insignificantly different than consensus estimates, this can move the markets higher or lower. Generally, the move is the inverse of the report. If initial jobless claims are down, the market will often rally upwards. If the initial jobless claims are up, the market may slump.\n\nThe Initial Jobless Claims Report gets a lot of press due to its simplicity and the basic assumption that the healthier the job market, the healthier the economy. That is, more people working means moredisposable incomein the economy, which leads to higher personal consumption andgross domestic product (GDP).\n\nMarkets may\u00a0react strongly to a mid-month jobless claims report, particularly if it shows a difference from the cumulative evidence of other recent indicators. For instance, if other indicators show a weakening economy, a surprise drop in jobless claims could slow down equity sellers and could actually lift stocks.\n\nSometimes this happens simply because there isn't any other recent data to chew on at the time.\u00a0A favorable initial jobless claims\u00a0report may also get lost in the shuffle of a busy news day\u00a0and hardly be noticed by Wall Street.\n\nJobless claims are also used as inputs for the creation of models and indicators. For example, average weekly initial jobless claims are one of the 10 components of the\u00a0Conference Board'sComposite Index of Leading Indicators.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the labor force is made up of the employed and the unemployed. Those who have jobs are employed. Those who are jobless, looking for a job, and available for work, are unemployed.\n\nThe three types of unemployment are frictional (voluntary changes in employment), structural (changes in the structure of an economy, such as technology replacing workers), and cyclical (those jobs that are lost due to changes in the business cycle.)\n\nNo, you cannot collect unemployment if you quit your job. Any voluntary unemployment is not eligible for unemployment benefits. This means you are only eligible for unemployment benefits if you are laid off, and in certain cases, if you are fired.\n\nJobless claims are the number of people filing weekly to receive unemployment insurance due to not having a job. It is an important leading indicator of the health of the economy. If jobless claims are growing, it signals a weakening economy. Conversely, if jobless claims are decreasing, it signals an improving economy.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims,\" Page 1.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"The Employment Situation.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims,\" Pages 4 & 9.\n\nThe Conference Board. \"Global Business Cycle Indicators.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cHow the Government Measures Unemployment,\" Select \"What are the basic concepts of employment and unemployment?\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Unemployment Insurance Program Fact Sheet,\" Page 1.",
