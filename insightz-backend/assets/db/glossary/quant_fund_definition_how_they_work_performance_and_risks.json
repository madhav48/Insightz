  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA quant fund is aninvestment fundwhose securities are chosen based on numerical data compiled throughquantitative analysis. These funds are considered non-traditional and passive.They are built with customized models using software programs to determine investments.\n\nProponents of quant funds believe that choosing investments using inputs and computer programs helps fund companies cut down on the risks and losses associated with management by humanfund managers.\n\nQuant funds rely on algorithmic or systematically programmedinvestment strategies. As such, they don't use the experience, judgment, or opinions of human managers to make investment decisions.They use quantitative analysis rather thanfundamental analysis, which is why they're also called quantitative funds.Not only can they be one of many investment offerings supported by asset managers, but they may also be part of the central management focus of specialized investment managers.\n\nGreater access to a broader range of market data fueled the growth of quant funds, not to mention the growing number of solutions surrounding the use ofbig data. Developments infinancial technologyand increasing innovation around automation have vastly broadened the data sets quant fund managers can work with, giving them even more robust data feeds for a broader analysis of scenarios and time horizons.\n\nLargeasset managershave looked to increase their investment in quantitative strategies as fund managers struggle to beat marketbenchmarksover time. Smallerhedge fundmanagers also round out the total quant fund offerings in the investment market.Overall, quant fund managers seek talented individuals with accredited academic degrees and highly technical experience in mathematics and programming.\n\nQuantitative strategies are often referred to as a Black Box due to the high level of secrecy surrounding the algorithms they use.\n\nQuant fund programming and quantitative algorithms have thousands oftrading signalsthey can rely on, ranging from economic data points to trending globalasset valuesand real-time company news. Quant funds are also known for building sophisticated models around momentum, quality, value, and financial strength using proprietary algorithms developed through advanced software programs.\n\nQuant funds have attracted a considerable amount of interest and investment because of the returns they have generated over the years. However, according to a report byInstitutional Investor, they've beenunderperformingsince 2016. In the five years leading up to 2021, the report said theMSCIWorld index and the equity quant index generated annualized returns of 11.6% and 0.88%, respectively.\n\nInstitutional Investorclaimed that the equity quant index was up 10.2% in 2010, 15.3% in 2011, 8.8% in 2012, 14.7% in 2013, 10.4% in 2014, and 9.2% in 2015.\n\nThe basis for quantitative analysis and, therefore, quant funds, has a history that dates back eight decades, with the publishing of a 1934 book calledSecurity Analysis. Written by Benjamin Graham and David Dodd, the book advocated investing based on the rigorous measurement of objective financialmetricsrelated to specificstocks.\n\nSecurity Analysishas been followed by further publications related to quantitative investment strategies, such as Joel Greenblatt\u2019sThe Little Book that Beats the Marketand James O'Shaughnessy\u2019sWhat Works on Wall Street.\n\nQuant funds are often classified as alternative investments since their management styles differ from more traditional fund managers.\n\nQuant funds typically run on a lower-cost basisbecause they don't need as many traditional analysts and portfolio managers to run them. However, their trading costs tend to be higher than traditional funds, due to a higher turnover of securities. Their offerings are also generally more complex than standard funds and it is common for some of them to target high-net-worth investors or have high fund entrance requirements.\n\nSome investors consider quant funds to be among the most innovative and highly technical offerings in the investment universe. They encompass a wide range of thematic investment styles and often deploy some of the industry\u2019s most groundbreaking technologies.\n\nSuccessful\u00a0quant funds\u00a0keep a close eye onrisk controldue to the nature of their models. Most strategies start with a universe or benchmark and use sector and industry weightings in their models. This allows the funds to control the diversification to a certain extent without compromising the model itself.\n\nSome have argued that quant funds present a systemic risk and do not embrace the concept of letting ablack boxrun their investments. For all the successful quant funds out there, just as many seem to be unsuccessful. Unfortunately, for the quants' reputation, when they fail, they often fail big time.\n\nLong-Term Capital Management (LTCM)\u00a0was one of the most famous quant hedge funds, as it was run by some of the most respected academic leaders and two Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economists,Myron S. ScholesandRobert C. Merton. During the 1990s, their team generated above-average returns and attracted capital from all types of investors. They were famous for not only exploiting inefficiencies but using easy access to capital to create enormousleveragedbets on market directions.\n\nThe disciplined nature of their strategy actually created the weakness that led to their collapse. LTCM was liquidated and dissolved in early 2000. Its models did not include the possibility that the Russian government coulddefaulton some of its own debt. This one event triggered events, and a chain reaction magnified by leverage created havoc. LTCM was so heavily involved with other investment operations that its collapse affected the world markets, triggering dramatic events. In the end, theFederal Reserve(Fed) stepped in to help, and other banks and\u00a0investment funds\u00a0supported LTCM to prevent any further damage.\n\nQuant funds can fail as they are largely based on historical events and the past doesn't always repeat itself in the future.\n\nWhile a strong quant team will be constantly adding new aspects to the models to predict future events, it's impossible to predict the future every time. Quant funds can also become overwhelmed when the economy and markets are experiencing greater than average volatility. The buy andsell signalscan come so quickly that high turnover can create high commissions andtaxable events.\n\nQuant funds can also pose a danger when they are marketed as bear-proof or are based on short strategies. Predicting downturns usingderivativesand combining leverage can be dangerous. One wrong turn can lead to implosions, which often make the news.\n\nInvestor.gov. \"Smart Beta, Quant Funds, and other Non-Traditional Index Funds.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nMorningstar. \"What Is a Quantitative Fund?\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nNasdaq. \"Quant Fund.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nMergers & Inquisitions. \"The Full Guide to Quant Funds: Careers, Salaries, Recruiting, Exits, and More.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nTop1000funds.com. \"The Future Is Quant.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nPensions & Investments. \"BlackRock Reorganizes Active Equity Unit, Turns More to Computer-based Quant Strategies.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nStreet of Walls. \"Role of the Quantitative Analyst.\" Accessed May 13, 2021.\n\nInstitutional Investor. \"Quant Funds Have a Problem.
