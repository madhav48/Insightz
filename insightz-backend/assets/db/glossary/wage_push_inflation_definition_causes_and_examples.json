  "term": "Wage Push Inflation: Definition, Causes, and Examples",
  "definition": "Wage push inflation is an overall rise in the cost of goods and services that results from a rise in wages. Employers must increase the prices they charge for goods and services to maintain corporate profits after an increase in employee pay. The overall increased cost of goods and services has a circular effect on the wage increase. Higher wages will eventually have to compensate for the increased prices ofconsumer goodsas goods and services in the market overall increase.\n\nCompanies can increase wages for several reasons. The most common is an increase in theminimum wage. The federal and state governments have the power to increase the minimum wage. The last time the federal minimum wage increased was July 24, 2009, when it increased to $7.25 per hour.Twenty-one states increased their minimum wage on January 1, 2025, raising wages and salaries for approximately 9.2 million workers by $5.7 billion.\n\nConsumer goods companies are also known for making incremental wage increases for their workers. These minimum wage increases are a leading factor for wage pushinflation. It's highly prevalent with consumer goods companies especially. Its effect is a function of the percentage increase in wages.\n\nIndustry factors also play a part in driving wage increases. Companies might raise wages to attract talent or provide higher compensation for their workers as an incentive to help business growth if a specific industry were to grow rapidly. All such factors have a wage push inflation effect on the goods and services the company provides.\n\nEconomists track wages closely because of their wage push inflation effects.\n\nWage push inflation has an inflationary spiral effect that occurs when wages are increased and businesses must charge more for their products or services to pay the higher wages. Any wage increase that occurs will also increase the money supply of consumers.\n\nConsumers have more spending power with a higher money supply so the demand for goods increases. An increase in demand then increases the price of goods in the broader market. Companies charge more for their goods to pay higher wages and the higher wages also increase the price of goods in the broader market.\n\nThe wage increase is not as helpful to employees as the cost of goods and services rises at the companies that are paying higher wages and in the broader market overall because the cost of goods in the market has also risen. Workers eventually require another wage increase to compensate for thecost of livingincrease if prices remain high. The percentage increase in wages and prices and their overall effect on the market are key factors driving inflation in the economy.\n\nA company must pay its employees $15 if a state raises the minimum wage from $12 to $15 as occurred in 2025 when 21 states increased their minimum wages in January.Now its cost of producing its goods and services has gone up because its cost of labor is now more expensive.\n\nThe District of Columbia has the top minimum wage of $17.50 an hour as of Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nThe company must increase the prices of its products on the market to compensate for the increase in costs. But the initial $3 raise in wages isn't enough to propel a consumer'spurchasing powerbecause goods and services have become more expensive. The wage must therefore be raised again, causing aninflationary spiral.\n\nWage increases cause inflation because the cost of producing goods and services goes up as companies pay their employees more. Companies must charge more for their goods and services to maintain the same level of profitability to make up for the increase in cost. The increase in the prices of goods and services is inflation.\n\nGovernments typically set an inflation target, which is approximately 2% a year in the U.S. An inflation target allows businesses and individuals to budget for the future. It provides an indicator for companies on how much to pay their employees and how much to charge for their goods and services. It indicates to individuals how much they can expect in wages as well as how much goods and services will cost.\n\nInflation reduces the future value of current money. The value of a dollar today is worth less than it will be in the future because prices go up. The same dollar today will be able to buy fewer goods and services in future years. Money is always worth more now than it is in the future, particularly due to the investment capability of money.\n\nEmployers are forced to respond when governments order wage increases for their workers. They require more income to comfortably accommodate those extra wages so they tend to increase the pricing of their products and services. This isn\u2019t just the result of legislation. Companies can voluntarily decide to pay their employers more for several reasons.\n\nThe result is wage push inflation.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Minimum Wage.\"\n\nEconomic Policy Institute. \"Over 9.2 million workers will get a raise January 1 from 21 states raising their minimum wages.\"\n\nEconomic Policy Institute. \"Over 9.2 million workers will get a raise on January 1 from 21 states raising their minimum wages.\"\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures. \"State Minimum Wages.\"\n\nUniversity of Michigan Journal of Economics. \"Why the 2% Inflation Target?\"",
