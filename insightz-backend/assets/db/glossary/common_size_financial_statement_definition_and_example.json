  "term": "Common Size Financial Statement: Definition and Example",
  "definition": "A common-size financial statement converts traditional numeric values into percentages of specific categories to percentages for easier comparisons across periods or companies.\n\nA common size financial statement take the dollar amounts on a financial statements, consistently divides them by a static base figure, and displays the financial statement lines as a percentage. This type of financial statement allows for easy analysis between companies or between periods. For example, a common-size balance sheet could reveal that one company's total assets are made up of 20% cash while another company's balance sheet is 25% cash.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nWhile most firms do not report their statements in common size format, it is beneficial for analysts to do so to compare two or more companies of differing size or different sectors of the economy. Formatting financial statements in this way reduces bias that can occur and allows for the analysis of a company over various periods. This analysis reveals, for example, what percentage of sales is thecost of goods soldand how that value has changed over time. Common size financial statements commonly include the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\n\nCommon size financial statements reduce all figures to a comparable figure, such as a percentage of sales or assets. Each financial statement uses a slightly different convention in standardizing figures.\n\nCommon size financial statements make it easier to determine what drives a company's profits and to compare the company to similar businesses.\n\nThebalance sheetprovides a snapshot overview of the firm's assets, liabilities, and shareholders' equity for the reporting period. Acommon size balance sheetis set up with the same logic as the common size income statement. The balance sheet equation is assets equalsliabilitiesplus stockholders' equity.\n\nThe balance sheet thus represents a percentage ofassets. Another version of the common size balance sheet shows asset line items as a percentage of total assets, liabilities as a percentage of total liabilities, andstockholders' equityas a percentage of total stockholders' equity.\n\nThe cash flow statement provides an overview of the firm's sources and uses of cash. The cash flow statement is divided amongcash flows from operations, cash flows from investing, and cash flows from financing. Each section provides additional information about the sources and uses of cash in each business activity.\n\nOne version of the common size cash flow statement expresses all line items as a percentage oftotal cash flow. The more popular version expresses cash flow in terms of total operational cash flow for items incash flows from operations, total investing cash flows for cash flows from investing activities, and total financing cash flows for cash flows from financing activities.\n\nTheincome statement(also referred to as the profit and loss (P&L) statement) provides an overview of flows of sales, expenses, andnet incomeduring the reporting period. The income statement equation is sales minus expenses and adjustments equals net income. This is why thecommon size income statementdefines all items as a percentage ofsales. The term \"common size\" is most often used when analyzing elements of the income statement, but the balance sheet and the cash flow statement can also be expressed as a common size statement.\n\nFor example, if a company has a simple income statement with gross sales of $100,000,cost of goods soldof $50,000, taxes of $1,000 and net income of $49,000, the common size statement would read as follows:",
