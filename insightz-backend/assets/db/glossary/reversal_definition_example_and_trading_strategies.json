  "term": "Reversal: Definition, Example, and Trading Strategies",
  "definition": "A reversal is a change in the price direction of an asset. A reversal can occur to the upside or downside. Following anuptrend, a reversal would be to the downside. Following adowntrend, a reversal would be to the upside. Reversals are based on overall price direction and are not typically based on one or two periods/bars on a chart.\n\nCertain indicators, such amoving average,oscillator, or channel, may help in isolating trends as well as spotting reversals. Reversals may be compared withbreakouts.\n\nReversals often occur in intraday trading and happen rather quickly, but they also occur over days, weeks, and years. Reversals occur in differenttime frameswhich are relevant to different traders. An intraday reversal on a five-minute chart doesn't matter to a long-term investor who is watching for a reversal on daily or weekly charts. Yet, the five-minute reversal is very important to aday trader.\n\nAn uptrend, which is a series of higherswing highsand higher lows, reverses into a downtrend by changing to a series of lower highs and lower lows. A downtrend, which is a series of lower highs and lower lows, reverses into an uptrend by changing to a series of higher highs and higher lows.\n\nTrends and reversals can be identified based onprice actionalone, as described above, or other traders prefer the use of indicators. Moving averages may aid in spotting both the trend and reversals. If the price is above a rising moving average then the trend is up, but when the price drops below the moving average that could signal a potential price reversal.\n\nTrendlinesare also used to spot reversals. Since an uptrend makes higher lows, a trendline can be drawn along those higher lows. When the price drops below the trendline, that could indicate atrend reversal.\n\nIf reversals were easy to spot, and to differentiate fromnoiseor brief pullbacks, trading would be easy. But it isn't. Whether using price action or indicators, manyfalse signalsoccur and sometimes reversals happen so quickly that traders aren't able to act quickly enough to avoid a large loss.\n\nThe chart shows an uptrend moving with achannel, making overall higher highs and higher lows. The price first breaks out of the channel and below the trendline, signaling a possible trend change. The price then also makes a lower low, dropping below the prior low within the channel. This further confirms the reversal to the downside.\n\nThe price then continues lower, making lower lows and lower highs. A reversal to the upside won't occur until the price makes a higher high and higher low. A move above the descending trendline, though, could issue an early warning sign of a reversal.\n\nReferring to the rising channel, the example also highlights the subjectivity of trend analysis and reversals. Several times within the channel the price makes a lower low relative to a prior swing, and yet the overall trajectory remained up.\n\nA reversal is a trend change in the price of an asset. Apullback is a counter-move within a trendthat doesn't reverse the trend. An uptrend is created by higher swing highs and higher swing lows. Pullbacks create the higher lows. Therefore, a reversal of the uptrend doesn't occur until the price makes a lower low on the time frame the trader is watching. Reversals always start as potential pullbacks. Which one it will ultimately turn out to be is unknown when it starts.\n\nReversals are a fact of life in the financial markets. Prices always reverse at some point and will have multiple upside and downside reversals over time. Ignoring reversals may result in taking moreriskthan anticipated. For example, a trader believes that a stock which has moved from $4 to $5 is well positioned to become much more valuable. They rode the trend higher, but now the stock is dropping to $4, $3, then $2. Reversal signs were likely evident well before the stock reached $2. Likely they were visible at before the price reached $4. Therefore, by watching for reversals the trader could havelocked in profitor kept themselves out of a now losing position.\n\nWhen a reversal starts, it isn't clear whether it is a reversal or a pullback. Once it is evident it is a reversal, the price may have already moved a significant distance, resulting in a sizable loss or profit erosion for the trader. For this reason, trend traders oftenexit while the price is still moving in their direction. That way they don't need to worry about whether the counter-trend move is a pullback or reversal.\n\nFalse signals are also a reality. A reversal may occur using an indicator or price action, but then the price immediately resumes to move in the prior trending direction again.",
