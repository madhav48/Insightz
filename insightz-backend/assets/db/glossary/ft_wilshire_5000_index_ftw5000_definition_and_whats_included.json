  "term": "FT Wilshire 5000 Index (FTW5000): Definition and What's Included",
  "definition": "The FT Wilshire 5000 Index (FTW5000) is abroad-basedmarket\u00a0capitalization-weighted index that seeks to capture 100% of the United States investible market.The FT Wilshire 5000 Index was formerly known as the Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index (TMWX) before being rebranded on June 30, 2021, as part of Wilshire's partnership with The Financial Times.\n\nNamed for the nearly 5,000 stocks it contained at launch, the Wilshire 5000 grew to a high count of over 7,500 in 1998. Since then, the roster has fallen to the current level of 3,687 (as of Dec. 31, 2021).The index includes all U.S. equities with readily available prices, with thinly-traded andbulletin-boardissues excluded.\n\nAs with all market capitalization-weighted indices, the Wilshireoverweightscompanies with a higher firm value andunderweightsthose with a lower firm value. As of Dec. 31, 2021, the index was weighted 28% toward the information technology sector, 13% to the health care sector, and 13% to the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nWilshire, as part of its partnership with The Financial Times, launched six other indexes\u2014as part of the FT Wilshire 5000 Series. The other six indexes include the FT Wilshire 2500 Index (FTW2500), FT Wilshire US Mega Cap Index (FTWUSG), FT Wilshire US Large Cap Index (FTWUSL), FT Wilshire US Mid Cap Index (FTWUSD), FT Wilshire US Small Cap Index (FTWUSS), and FT Wilshire US Micro Cap Index (FTWUSO).\n\nThe FT Wilshire 5000 Index is meant to be the broadest-based market index. A broad-based\u00a0index is designed to reflect the movement of an entire market. Although it does not include everypublicly-traded company, it does include a lot more than the other indices which people often refer to as \"the market,\" like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021\n\nThe FT Wilshire 5000 Index was established by the\u00a0Wilshire Associates\u00a0in 1974 and was\u00a0renamed the \"Dow Jones Wilshire 5000\" in April 2004, after\u00a0Dow Jones & Company\u00a0took over its management.On March 31, 2009,\u00a0the index returned to Wilshire Associates when\u00a0the partnership with Dow Jones was terminated.\n\nWhen it started, the value of the index was 1404.60 points on base date Dec. 31, 1980, with a\u00a0total market capitalization of $1,404.596 billion. On that date, each point on the index was equal to $1 billion, but\u00a0divisor adjustments due to corporate actions and index composition changes have changed the relationship over time.\n\nThe index increased more than 10 times over in less than 20 years,\u00a0closing at a record high of 14,751.64 points on March 24, 2000.That level wasn't\u00a0surpassed until Feb. 20, 2007.\n\nOn April 20, 2007, the index closed above 15,000 for the first time.On that day, the\u00a0S&P 500\u00a0was still several percentage points below its March 2000 high, because small-cap issues absent from the S&P 500 and included in the Wilshire 5000 outperformed the large-cap issues that dominate the S&P 500 during the cyclical bull market. The index reached an all-time high on Oct. 9, 2007, at the 15,806.69 point level, right before the onset ofThe\u00a0Great Recession.\n\nOn Oct. 8, 2007, the Wilshire 5000 closed below 10,000 for the first time since 2003.The index continued trading downward toward a 13-year low, reaching a bottom of 6,858.43 points on March 9, 2009,\u00a0representing a loss of about $10.9 trillion in market capitalization from its highs in 2007.\n\nThe Wilshire 5000 hit its first intraday high over 20,000 points on Feb. 28, 2014. On March 4, the index closed above this milestone for the first time.On July 1, 2014, the index closed above the 21,000 level for the first time.As of Feb. 1, 2022, the index traded at a near all-time high level of over 45,000.\n\nThe Wilshire 5000 may still be the most widely-cited broad-based market index, but several other important broad indices also exist, such as the CRSP US Total Market Index. Like the Wilshire 5000, the CRSP US Total Market Index also strives to represent a full picture of U.S. equities with almost 4,000 holdings representing mega-, large-, small-, and micro-capitalizations.\n\nTheDow Jones U.S. Total Market Index(DWCF) is amarket-capitalization-weighted index that Dow Jones Indexes maintains that provides broad-based coverage of the U.S. stock market. The Dow Jones U.S. Market Index, considered a total market index, includes all U.S. common market equities that meet certain eligibility requirements.\n\nTheRussell 3000Index is another\u00a0market-capitalization-weighted equity index maintained byFTSERussell\u00a0that provides exposure to\u00a0the entire U.S.stock market. The index tracks the performance of the 3,000 largest U.S.-traded stocks which represent about 98% of all U.S incorporated equity securities.\n\nWilshire. \"FT Wilshire 5000 Index.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nWilshire. \"Wilshire Launches Enhanced FT Wilshire 5000 Index Series.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nAmerican Enterprise Institute. \"The Vanishing Stock Market.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nWilshire. \"Indexes,\" Select, \"FT Wilshire 5000 Index Series.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nWilshire. \"Our History.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nWall Street Journal. \"Dow Jones Indexes, Wilshire Team Up on Financial Gauges.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nGlobeNewswire. \"Dow Jones Indexes Introduces Total Stock Market Index Family.\" Accessed Feb. 1, 2022.\n\nYahoo!
