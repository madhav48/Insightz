  "term": "Market Exposure: Definition, Measurement, Types, Risk Strategies",
  "definition": "Market exposure refers to the dollar amount of funds or percentage of a broaderportfoliothat is invested in a particular type of security, market sector, or industry. Market exposure is usually expressed as a percentage of total portfolio holdings, for instance, as in 10% of a portfolio being exposed to the oil and gas sector or a $ 50,000 in Tesla stock.\n\nMarket exposure represents the amount an investor can lose from the risks unique to a particular investment or asset class. It is a tool used to measure and balance risk in an investment portfolio.\u00a0Having too much exposure to a particular area can indicate a portfolio needs to undergo broaderdiversification.\n\nMarket exposure describes the risk and reward potential for an investor given the division of assets within an investment portfolio. The proportion of assets invested in any given asset class, market segment, geographic region, industry, orstockcan be used to measure the degree to which the investor is exposed to potential loss due to those specific assets.\u00a0\"\n\nMarket exposure can be separated based on a variety of factors that then allows an investor to mitigate the risks involved in certain investments by balancing exposure via diversification to other asset classes, regions, or industries. The greater one's market exposure, the greater their totalmarket riskin that specific investment area. A concentration of market exposure in any one area can lead to large losses if that area happens to get hit hard.\n\nInvestments can be segmented based on the type of asset class involved. For example, a portfolio can consist of 20% bonds and 80% stocks. The investor\u2019s market exposure tostocksis thus 80%. This investor stands to lose or gain more depending on how stocks perform than from how bonds perform.\n\nWhen examining the market exposure in a portfolio, an investor can also examine holdings by geographic location. This may include separating domestic investments from those of foreign economies, or further dividing foreign markets by their specific region in the world or as emerging markets.\n\nFor example, an investor could have a portfolio that is allocated to 50% domestic and 50% foreign stocks. If additional exposure separation is desired, the foreign holdings may be divided further to show 30% in Asian markets and 20% in European markets. Moreover, we can describe the Asian segment as allocated 50% to developed and emerging markets apiece.\n\nInvestments can also be divided up by the industry or economic sector within which the underlying companies operate.\n\nUsing the above hypothetical investor\u2019s 80% market exposure to stocks, there might be a 30% market exposure to the health care sector, 25% exposure to thetechnology sector, 20% to the financial services sector, 15% to the defense sector, and 10% to theenergy sector. The portfolio\u2019s returns are more influenced by health care stocks than by energy stocks because of the greater market exposure to the former.\n\nThe exposure of a portfolio to particular securities, markets, or sectors must be considered when determining a portfolio\u2019s overallasset allocationsince diversification can greatly increase returns while also minimizing losses. For instance, a portfolio with both stock and bond holdings that includes market exposure to both types of assets typically has less risk than a portfolio with exposure only to stocks. In other words, diversification in this way reduces market exposure risks.\n\nThis applies to allocating assets across different asset classes or industries. Using the aforementioned example, if the investor wanted to reduce high market exposure to health care because of major changes in the industry brought by new federal regulations, selling 50% of thoseholdingsreduces that particular exposure to 15%.",
