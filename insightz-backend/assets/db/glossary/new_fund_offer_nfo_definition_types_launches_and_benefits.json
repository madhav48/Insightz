  "definition": "A new fund offer (NFO) is the first subscription offering for any new fund offered by an investment company. A newfundoffer occurs when a\u00a0fund\u00a0is launched, allowing the firm to raise capital for purchasing securities.Mutual fundsare one of the most common new fund offerings marketed by an investment company. The initial purchasing offer for a new fund varies by the fund\u2019s structuring.\n\nA new fund offer is\u00a0similar to an initial public offering (IPO). Both represent attempts to raise capital to further operations. New fund offers can be accompanied by aggressivemarketing campaigns, created to entice investors to purchase units in the fund. New fund offers often have the potential for significant gains after beginning to trade publicly.\n\nMutual funds are the most common type of new fund offering. New fund offerings can be for open-end or closed-end mutual funds. New exchange-traded funds are also first offered through a new fund offering. Below are details on how to invest in a few of the market\u2019s common types of new fund offerings.\n\nIn a new fund offer, anopen-end fundwill announce new shares for purchase on a specified launch day. Open-end funds do not limit their number of shares. These funds can be bought and sold from abrokerage firmon their initial launch date and thereafter.\n\nThe shares do not trade on an exchange and are managed by the fund company and/or fund company affiliates. Open-end mutual funds report net asset values daily after the market\u2019s close.\n\nFund companies can launch new fund offers for new strategies or add additional share classes to existing strategies.\n\nClosed-end new fund offers are often some of the most highly marketed new fund issuances since closed-end funds only issue a specified number of shares during their new fund offer. Closed-end funds trade on an exchange with daily price quotes throughout the day. Investors can buyclosed-end fundson their launch date through a brokerage firm.\n\nNewexchange-traded funds(ETFs) are also launched through a new fund offer. An exchange-traded fund is a type of investment fund that can be publicly traded on the stock market. Most ETFs track an index and can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, making them easy investments to manage. Generally, they come with lower expense ratios because many are passively managed.\n\nOften, new fund offers are not widely publicized making them challenging to identify. Companies must register a new fund offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) offering one method of tracking.\n\nInvestors seeking information on new fund offers prior to their launch date may also receive alerts from their brokerage firm. News outlets and news aggregators are also good sources of information on new fund offers. Sources such as theClosed-End Fund Centerprovide details on new fund offers.\n\nCompanies will also issue press releases on new fund offers.\n\nIn 2023, total net assets in U.S. mutual funds were $25.5 trillion, and $8.1 trillion in ETFs.\n\nInvesting in a new mutual fund may seem like an exciting way to diversify your portfolio, however, there are some concerns you should know about before doing so. For example, many investment companies launch a new fund when the market is rich and investors are hungry to get in on the latest new industry or sector of the economy.\n\nHowever, just because a certain technology or industry is booming now does not mean it will remain popular in the future. Furthermore, a new fund offer often comes with a higher expense ratio than normal.\n\nAnother big risk of investing in an NFO is also one of the most obvious\u2014the fund has no track record of success (or failure). While some bullish investors may look at this as an opportunity for large profits, there is also a serious risk in investing in a fund whose performance you cannot track.\n\nAccess to emerging sector of the economy\n\nProvides ability to diversify portfolio\n\nPotentially larger expense ratio\n\nEmerging technology or industry the fund tracks may be overvalued\n\nA new fund offer, or NFO, is the first offering of an open-end, closed-end, or exchange-traded fund to investors by an investment company.\n\nWhile investing in an NFO may present an opportunity for large profits, investors should be wary of investing their money into a fund with no proven track record of success.\n\nInvestors can research new launches of funds either by monitoring various investment companies' press releases or by checking NFO-related news aggregator sites such as the Closed-End Fund Center.\n\nOf course, there is no surefire method to predict with complete certainty a fund's success, particularly a brand new one. However, investors should look for a lower expense ratio, and monitor the performance of the other funds offered by the investment company before investing in an NFO.\n\nInvestment managers are often offering new investment funds. These funds focus on new aspects of investing or an area of the market that was not covered before. In doing so, they offer a first subscription to bring on new investors.\n\nThis is a new fund offer and occurs when a fund is launched. While investing in a new fund offering can seem like a good opportunity, it can also be risky because the fund has not yet been proven and does not have an established track record for investors to make a clear investment decision.\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \"2024 Investment Company Factbook,\" Page 2 of PDF.",
