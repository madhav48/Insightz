  "term": "Unilateral Transfer: Meaning, Overview, Examples",
  "definition": "A unilateral transfer is a one-way transfer of money, goods, or services from one party to another. It is often used to describe payments made by a government to their citizens, or from one country to another country in the form offoreign aid. In these cases, the supplier of funds receives nothing in return from the recipient. A unilateral transfer differs from a bilateral transfer, such asbilateral trade, which involves reciprocal economic benefit for both parties to a transaction.\n\nUnilateral transfers occur frequently as gifts in everyday life. This can be contrasted with bilateral transfers, a mutual exchange of goods, money, or services. A birthday gift or wedding present are examples where nothing is expected in return.\n\nDonations to charities or other forms of philanthropy can also be construed as a unilateral transfer, although some such donations may receive tax benefits.Governments may hand out unilateral transfers in the form of economic stimulus, for instance, in the checks sent to American families during the financial crisis in early 2020.\n\nUnilateral transfers sent by governments are included in thecurrent accountof a nation'sbalance of payments. They are distinct from trade transactions, which are bilateral in that both parties receive something. Unilateral transfers encompass things such as humanitarian aid and payments made by immigrants to their native countries.\n\nUnilateral transfers are thus often involved in instances of direct foreign aid. Unilateral aid occurs when one government directly transfers money or other assets to a recipient country. Critics have argued, however, that direct foreign aid can be problematic and lead to negative unintended consequences.\n\nFor instance, direct cash sent to Africa has been \"an unmitigated economic, political, and humanitarian disaster,\" as written by Zambian-born economist andWorld Bankconsultant Dambisa Moyo in her bookDead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way to Help Africa.Foreign governments are often corrupt and use foreign aid money to bolster their military control or to create propaganda-style education programs instead of using it to help their population.\n\nThe economic stimulus provided to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the form of direct payments to households, constitutes a unilateral payment, in that the government provided funds with no expectations of receiving something in return. Indirectly, the expectation was that the payments would help bolster the economy by sparking more consumer spending. However, there was no expectation or requirement for any repayment. The U.S. government spent an estimated $817 billion onthree rounds of paymentsbetween March 2020 and March 2021.\n\nSome foreign aid is considered to be a unilateral transfer, such as when the U.S. or another nation provides humanitarian support to a nation without expectation of anything in return. But some forms of foreign aid are bilateral, such as when a country provides military aid in exchange for certain agreements of cooperation or allyship.\n\nA nation providing humanitarian or military aid can constitute a unilateral transfer. On an individual level, a gift, a donation, or any other form of aid without expected reciprocation is also considered to be a unilateral transfer.\n\nAunilateral contractis a one-sided agreement in which the party making the offer agrees to pay only after the party that accepts the offer has completed a task. This differs from a bilateral contract in which both parties must abide by the agreement.\n\nA unilateral transfer is a type of payment or aid from one party to another that doesn't require anything in return. A government can make a unilateral transfer to its citizens, in the form of economic stimulus, or social security, or to another country in the form of humanitarian or military aid. A person or organization can make a gift, donation or other form of support to an individual with no expectation of reciprocation, constituting a unilateral transfer.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Information on Donated Property.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"U.S. Economic Recovery in the Wake of COVID-19: Successes and Challenges,\" Page 1.\n\nDambisa Moyo, via Google Books. \"Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa: Introduction.\" Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2009.\n\nPandemic Oversight. \"Three Rounds of Stimulus Checks.\"",
