  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) is a law designed to provide financial assistance to post-secondary school students and strengthen the educational resources of the United States' colleges and universities. The HEA increased the amount of federal money given to post-secondary school institutions, developed scholarship programs, provided low-interest loans to students, and founded the National Teachers Corps.\n\nPart of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society domestic agenda, the act was signed into law on Nov. 8, 1965, and has been reauthorized by Congress several times since. The act expired in 2013, and Congress has been unable to reach an agreement on its reauthorization. However, it has been running on temporary extensions since then, with now-familiar programs like Pell Grants remaining available.\n\nPresident Johnson advocated the passage of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), which stated the goals of increasing educational opportunities for the children of lower\u2014and middle-income families, bolstering cash-strapped small colleges, and improving library resources at higher education institutions.\n\nOn the 50th anniversary of its passage in 2015, the National Education Association (NEA) lauded the program for making a college education affordable to \"millions of smart, low- and middle-income Americans by establishing need-based grants, work-study opportunities, and federal student loans.\"\n\nIt also enabled the establishment of a TRIO program, which assists educational programs designed to reach low-income and disadvantaged students from middle school through graduate school.\n\nThe act has the following titles:\n\nTitle I:Provides funding for extension and continuing education programs.\n\nTitle II:Authorizes grants for recruiting, educating, and training teachers.\n\nTitle III:Contains provisions for strengthening developing institutions.\n\nTitle IV:Provides student assistance through scholarships, low-interest loans, and work-study programs.\n\nTitle V:Contains provisions for improving the quality of teaching.\n\nTitle VI:Contains provisions for improving undergraduate instruction.\n\nTitle VII:Contains provisions for graduate education programs and innovation in post-secondary education.\n\nTitle VIII:Contains provisions focused on various post-secondary and graduate-level educational topics.\n\nThe HEA has undergone multiple reauthorizations and amendments, including adding new title initiatives.\n\nThe total amount of student debt owed by Americans, as of Q3'24.\n\nThe HEA established various financial aid options for students attending post-secondary schools in the U.S. Financial assistance programs, includingPell Grantsand Stafford loans, were created as a direct result of this legislation.\n\nPell Grants, which don't need to be repaid, come fromfederal fundingand are available to undergraduate students. The amount offered under the grants is based on financial need, the cost of the school, and each student\u2019s standing for full-time or part-time attendance. The legislation that reauthorizes the grant program sets a maximum amount of funding per recipient.\n\nStafford loans, which can be directly subsidized or directly unsubsidized loans, are offered to students in need of financial assistance.\n\nDirect subsidized loans are available to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. The amount of the loan is determined by the costs of the school the student is attending.\n\nThe interest on such loans is paid by the U.S. Department of Education as long as the student remains enrolled at least half-time in college. The interest is also covered for six months after the student leaves school.\n\nDirect unsubsidized loans don't have financial need requirements and are available to graduate students and undergraduates.The college or university will determine the size of the loan and other financial assistance that was received.\n\nThe borrower is responsible for repaying all the interest on a direct unsubsidized loan.\n\nTechnically, Stafford loans don't exist anymore, as the term refers to a subsidized or unsubsidized federal Stafford Loan that students could apply for in the past if they went to schools that participated in the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program.\n\nNo loans have been made under that program since July 1, 2010. However, many schools and individuals still use the terms \"Stafford loans\" and \"direct Stafford loans\" to refer to direct subsidized loans and unsubsidized loans made under the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program.\n\nThe HEA was reauthorized every five years from its initial passage in 1965, frequently with amendments added until 2008.It has failed to gain formal reauthorization since 2013, but its programs have operated on temporary extensions since then.\n\nThe HEA technically expired at the end of 2013, although its programs were allowed to continue operating while Congress debated proposed changes to it.\n\nIn 2020, the Senate was nearing an agreement on reauthorizing and updating the HEA when the pandemic placed discussions about it and many other matters on hold.\n\nProposed changes still on the table include a simplified student aid application process and an increase in the maximum size of Pell Grants.\n\nThe National Education Association calls the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) \"the cornerstone of college affordability\" for Americans. In 2021\u201322, 32% of college undergraduates received Pell Grants to help pay for their education.More than 42 million Americans have federal student loans as of Q3'24.\n\nTitle IV authorizes and funds scholarships, low-interest loans, and work-study programs for students at eligible colleges and universities. Its best-known programs include Pell Grants and Stafford loans.\n\nHigher education refers to a course of study beyond the high school level, leading to the award of a degree, diploma, or certificate. This definition can encompass studies at a college, a university, a professional school, or a technical school.\n\nIn the context of the HEA, a Title 1 school is a post-secondary institution of higher learning that has been approved to receive direct federal assistance to enhance its library or strengthen its programs or is approved to accept students whose tuition is subsidized by the HEA.\n\nIt shouldn't be confused with Title 1 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That Title 1 is a federal program that supplements state and local funding for public schools in economically disadvantaged areas of the U.S.\n\nToday's students weren't born or even thought of when the HEA was first passed in 1965. But its core concept, making a college education accessible to Americans of modest means, has stood the test of time and served generations of American students.\n\nSageJournals. \"The National Teacher Corps: A Study of Shifting Goals and Changing Assumptions,\" Page 932.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The Higher Education Act (HEA): A Primer.\"\n\nAmerican Council on Education. \"Renewing the Higher Education Act.\"\n\nThe Pell Institute. \"Do You Know TRIO?
