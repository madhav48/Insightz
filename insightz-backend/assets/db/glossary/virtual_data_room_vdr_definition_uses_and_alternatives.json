  "term": "Virtual Data Room (VDR): Definition, Uses, and Alternatives",
  "definition": "A virtual data room (VDR), also known as a deal room, is a secure online repository for document storage and distribution.\u00a0It is typically utilized during the due diligence process preceding a merger or acquisition to review, share, and disclose company documentation.\n\nVirtual data rooms have increasingly replaced physical data rooms traditionally used to disclose and share documents. With theglobalizationof business and increased scrutiny to reduce costs, virtual data rooms are an attractive alternative to physical data rooms. Virtual data rooms are widely accessible, immediately available, and more secure.\n\nAs security concerns grow and incidents with breaches increase, VDR providers are developing more sophisticated and reliable databases.Initial public offerings(IPOs), auditing operations, and partnerships or other businesses that must work jointly and share information will use virtual\u00a0data rooms.\n\nMergers and acquisitions(M&A) procedures are the most common use of\u00a0VDRs. These repositories\u00a0provide a place for the due diligence needed during the finalization of the deal.\u00a0These business transactions involve large amounts of documents, many of which are confidential and contain sensitive information.\u00a0Using a VDR is a safe and reliable way for all interested parties to review and exchange documents as they engage in negotiations.\n\nBusinesses often work with one another to produce and manufacture products\u00a0during the construction of a building\u00a0and to offer services. Forming and maintaining these business relationships requires contracts and the frequent transmission of data. Virtual data rooms provide for the storage of these contracts and make readily available documents needed for the continuance of business partnerships. As an example, changes made to the blueprints of a structure by an engineer are immediately available to all contractors involved in the project.\n\nAuditingcompany practices, compliance, and accounts is a common practice in all businesses. This process is frequently a problem as workers must interact with external regulators and adjusters. Also, today\u00a0many companies have offices in remote locations and around the globe in various time zones.\n\nThe use of a virtual data room allows attorneys, accountants, internal and external regulators, and other interested parties\u00a0to have a centralized point of access. Providing a central system reduces errors and time. Also, it provides for communication transparency.\u00a0Depending on the type of audit, the level of access, and authority varies.\n\nOffering an initial public offering (IPO) is a daunting task requiring an inconceivable amount of paperwork.\u00a0Like audits, transparency is essential.\u00a0Companies must create, exchange, retain, and manage large volumes of documents.\u00a0Because of the nature of the transaction, most users will have restricted access, such as \"view only.\"\u00a0The ability to copy, forward, or print may be prohibited.\n\nAlthough virtual data rooms offer many benefits, they are not suitable for every industry.\u00a0For example, some governments may elect to continue using physical data rooms for highly confidential exchanges of information.\u00a0The damage from potential cyber-attacks anddata breachesexceeds the benefits offered by virtual data rooms.\u00a0The results of such events could be cataclysmic if threatening parties accessed classified information.\u00a0In those instances, the use of a VDR will not be a consideration.",
