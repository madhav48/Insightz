  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA joint return is a tax return filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on the new, simplifiedForm 1040(as of 2024) by two married taxpayers whose filing status is married filing jointly (MFJ) or by a widowed\u00a0taxpayer whose filing status is Qualifying Widow or Widower (QW). A joint return allows these taxpayers to combine their tax liability and report their income, deductions, and credits on the same joint return.\n\nA joint return permits eligible taxpayers to figure out their taxes using\u00a0favorable joint return tax brackets, tax rates, and tax benefits. As a result, married couples who\u00a0file\u00a0a joint return generally pay a lower overall tax than married couples who file\u00a0two separate returns.\n\nTo file a joint return, the taxpayers' filing status must be either Married Filing Jointly (MFJ) or Qualifying Widow/er (QW). To be eligible for the married\u00a0filing jointly (MFJ) filing status, the taxpayers must be legally married to each other on or before the last day of the tax year and both must agree to file and must sign the Joint Return.\n\nTo qualify as qualifying widow/er (QW), the taxpayer\u2019s spouse must have died in either of the two prior tax years and the taxpayer must maintain a household for a dependent child.\n\nAlso, nonresident aliens generally cannot file\u00a0as married\u00a0filing jointly\u00a0if either spouse was a\u00a0nonresident alien\u00a0at any time during the tax year.\n\nWhether or not taxpayers are considered married on the last day of the tax year is decided by the law of the applicable state or jurisdiction.\u00a0Same-sex marriages that are legally entered into are recognized for all federal tax purposes.\n\nTaxpayers who divorce or separate under a decree of divorce or separate maintenance that is final at any point during the tax year are considered unmarried for that entire year and cannot file a joint return.\n\nTaxpayers who are married and not widowed must choose one of two filing statuses: married filing jointly (MFJ) or married filing separately (MFS). Filing jointly is likely to result in less tax if one spouse earns most of the income and deductions will not be itemized.\n\nFiling separately\u00a0may result in less tax if both spouses earn the same income and if one or both have medical expenses, casualty losses, or miscellaneous deductions since joint and separate tax rates are likely to be the same and since adjusted gross income floors will be lower. Any time both spouses earn taxable income, the tax should be figured both jointly and separately and a return filed using the status that provides the lowest tax.\n\nNo, registered domestic partners may not file their taxes using a married filing jointly or married filing separately status. Registered domestic partners are not married under state law, so do not qualify for joint filing status.\n\nThe marriage penalty refers to an additional tax burden that occurs for married couples compared to single filers. This penalty occurs when the dual income of married couples pushes them into a higher tax bracket that would not have occurred if they had filed separate returns.\n\nAlthough married filing separately allows you to separate your tax liabilities this can cause you to lose access to several tax credits available to couples using married filing jointly. Credits you can't take include the American Opportunity Credit, the Lifetime Learning Credit, and deductions for student loan interest, tuition, and fees. Other benefits may not be available, like the Earned Income Tax Credit or Adoption Credit, depending on your circumstances.\n\nA joint return allows married couples and recently widowed taxpayers to file federal income taxes on the same return. This option provides numerous benefits for most filers, including preferential tax brackets and credits. If you qualify for a joint return but are unsure if you should use this status, you should speak with a tax professional or compare your tax liabilities using all the statuses available to you to find the best option.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Married Filing Jointly Filing Status.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Answers to Frequently Asked Questions for Individuals of the Same Sex Who Are Married Under State Law.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"How a Taxpayer's Filing Status Affects Their Tax Return.\"",
