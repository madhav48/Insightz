Average life does not take into account interest payments, but only principal payments made on the loan or security. In loans, mortgages, and bonds, the average life is the average period of time before the debt is repaid throughamortizationorsinking fundpayments.\n\nInvestors and analysts use the average life calculation to measure the risk associated with amortizing bonds, loans, and mortgage-backed securities. The calculation gives investors an idea of how quickly they can expect returns and provides a useful metric for comparing investment options. In general, most investors will choose to receive theirfinancial returnsearlier and will, therefore, choose the investment with the shorter average life.\n\nAlso called the weighted average maturity andweighted average life, the average life is calculated to determine how long it will take to pay the outstanding principal of a debt issue, such as aTreasury Bill(T-Bill) or bond. While some bonds repay the principal in a lump sum at maturity, others repay the principal in installments over the term of the bond. In cases where the bond's principal is amortized, the average life allows investors to determine how quickly the principal will be repaid.\n\nThe payments received are based on the repayment schedule of the loans backing the particular security, such as withmortgage-backed securities (MBS)andasset-backed securities (ABS). As borrowers make payments on the associated debt obligations, investors are issued payments reflecting a portion of these cumulative interest and principal payments.\n\nTo calculate the average life, multiply the date of each payment (expressed as a fraction of years or months) by the percentage of total principal that has been paid by that date, add the results, and divide by the total issue size.\n\nFor example, assume an annual-paying four-year bond has aface valueof $200 and principal payments of $80 during the first year, $60 for the second year, $40 during the third year, and $20 for the fourth (and final) year. The average life for this bond would be calculated with the following formula:\n\n($80 x 1) + ($60 x 2) + ($40 x 3) + ($20 x 4) = 400\n\nThen divide the weighted total by the bond face value to get the average life. In this example, the average life equals 2 years (400 divided by 200 = 2).\n\nThis bond would have an average life of two years against itsmaturityof four years.\n\nIn the case of an MBS or ABS, the average life represents the average length of time required for the associated borrowers to repay the loan debt. An investment in an MBS or ABS involves purchasing a small portion of the associated debt that is packaged within the security.\n\nThe risk associated with an MBS or ABS centers on whether the borrower associated with the loan will default. If the borrower fails to make a payment, the investors associated with the security will experience losses. In thefinancial crisisof 2008, a large number of defaults on home loans, particularly in the subprime market, led to significant losses in the MBS arena.\n\nWhile certainly not as dire asdefault risk, another risk bond investors face isprepayment risk. This occurs when the bond issuer (or the borrower in the case of mortgage-backed securities) pays back the principal earlier than scheduled. These prepayments will reduce the average life of the investment. Because the principal is paid back early, the investor will not receive future interest payments on that part of the principal.\n\nThis interest reduction can represent an unexpected challenge for investors of fixed-income securities dependent on a reliable stream of income. For this reason, some bonds with payment risk includeprepayment penalties.\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Subprime Mortgage Crisis.\" Accessed Aug. 20, 2021.",
