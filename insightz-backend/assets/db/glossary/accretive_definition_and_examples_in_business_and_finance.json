  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nIn both finance and in general lexicon, the term \"accretive\" is the adjective form of the word \"accretion\", which refers to gradual or incremental growth. For example, an acquisition deal may be deemed accretive for the absorbing company, if that deal contributes to an increase inearnings per share.\n\nBy definition, in corporate finance,accretive acquisitionsof assets or businesses must ultimately add more value to a company, than the expenditures associated with the acquisition. This can be due to the fact that the newly-acquired assets in question are purchased at a discount to their perceivedcurrent market value, or if the assets are expected to grow, as a direct result of the transaction.\n\nKey Takeaways--The term \"accretive\" is an adjective that refers to business deals that result in gradual or incremental growth in value for a company.--In corporate finance, accretive acquisitions of assets must add more value to a company, than the costs of acquiring the target entity,--Accretive deals can occur if acquired assets are purchased at a discount to their perceived current market value.--In general finance, accretive investments refer to any security that is purchased at a discount.\n\nIn general finance, accretion refers to the change in the price of a bond or security. In fixed-income investments, the word accretive may be used to describe the increase in value attributable to interest accrued but not paid. For example, discounted bonds earn interest through accretion, until they reach maturity. In such cases, acquired bonds are acquiredat a discountwhen compared to thecurrent facevalue of the bond, also known as the par. As the bond matures, the value increases, based on theinterest ratethat was in effect at the time of issuance.\n\nThe rate of accretion is determined by dividing the discount by the number of years in the term. In the case of zerocouponbonds, the interest acquired is notcompounded. While the value of the bond increases based on the agreed-upon interest rate, it must be held for the agreed-upon term, before it can be cashed out.\n\nIf a person purchases a bond with a value of $1,000, for the discounted price of $750, with the understanding that it will be held for 10 years, the deal is considered accretive, because the bond pays out the initial investment, plus interest. Depending on the type of bond purchased, interest may be paid out at regular intervals (annually, semi-annually, etc.), or it may be paid in lump sum, upon maturity.\n\nWith zero coupon bonds, there is no interest accrual. Instead, it is purchased at a discount, such as the initial $750 investment for a bond with a face value of $1,000. The bond pays theoriginal facevalue, also known as theaccreted value, of $1,000, in a lump sum upon maturity.\n\nIn corporate finance acquisition deals are often accretive. First, let's assume that the earnings per share of Corporation X is listed as $100, and earnings per share of Corporation Y is listed as $50. When Corporation X acquires Corporation Y, Corporations X\u2019s earnings per share increase to $150--rendering this a 50% accretive deal.\n\n[Important: The antonym to \"accretive\" is \"dilutive\", which describes any deal which causes a corporation's earnings per share value to drop.]",
