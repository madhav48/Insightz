  "term": "Married Filing Separately Explained: How It Works and Its Benefits",
  "definition": "Married filing separately is a tax status for married couples who choose to record their respectiveincomes,exemptions, anddeductionson separate tax returns. This means both married spouses file separate tax returns. When one spouse has significant medical expenses or miscellaneousitemized deductions, or when both spouses have about the same amount of income, it might bewiser to file separately. The alternative to married filing separately ismarried filing jointly. It usually makes sense financially for married couples to file jointly.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)gives taxpayers five taxfiling statusoptions when they submit their annual tax returns: single, married filing jointly, married filing separately,head of household, orqualifying widow(er).\n\nAnyone who files as married in either category\u2014filing separately or filing jointly\u2014must be married as of the last day of thattax year. In other words, someone who filed taxes for the year 2024 as married must have been married no later than Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nUsing the married filing separately status may be appealing and offer financial advantages to certain couples. Combining incomes and filing jointly might push them into a highertax bracketand thus increase their tax bill.\n\nWhen couples file separately, they must include their spouse\u2019s information on theirreturns. According to the IRS, if you and your spouse file separate returns and one of you itemizes deductions, then the other spouse will have astandard deductionof zero. Therefore, the other spouse should also itemize deductions.\n\nAlthough there are financial advantages to filing separately, couples miss out ontax creditsmeant for couples who file jointly. If you and your spouse both generated taxable income, calculate your tax bill as a joint and separate filer before filing, to determine which of the two will save you more money.\n\nIf you live incommunity propertystates\u2014Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin\u2014you may need to see a tax professional, because the rules about separate incomes can be tricky.\n\nIn most cases, it makes sense for married couples to file jointly, especially since theTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)of 2017 was passed. However, there are exceptions, including when one spouse has significant miscellaneous deductions or medical expenses.\n\nAs a result of theTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the standard deduction rose substantially in the 2018 tax year.\n\nA standard deduction is a portion of income that\u2019s not subject to tax, thereby reducingtaxable income. The IRS allows tax filers to take a standard deduction. However, the deduction amount is dependent on your filing status, age, and whether you are disabled or claimed as adependenton someone else\u2019s tax return.The standard deduction for the 2024 tax year is:\n\nAs a result, one spouse must have significant miscellaneous deductions ormedical expensesfor the couple to gain any advantage from filing separately.\n\nThe IRS introducedDirect File, which allows qualifying taxpayers to file their federal tax returns directly for free. The pilot is available to taxpayers who lived in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, Wisconsin, and Wyoming in 2024. Refer to theIRS websiteto see if you qualify.\n\nMarried filing jointly offersthe most tax savings, especially when spouses have different income levels. If you use the married filing separately status, then you may be unable to take advantage of a number of potentially valuabletax breaks, such as the following:\n\nTheChild and Dependent Care Creditis a nonrefundable tax credit used by taxpayers to claim unreimbursed childcare expenses. Childcare can include fees paid for babysitters, daycare, summer camps\u2014provided that they aren\u2019t overnight\u2014and other care providers forchildrenunder the age of 13 or dependents of any age who aren\u2019t physically or mentally able to care for themselves.\n\nTheAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)helps offset costs for post-secondary education. It was introduced in 2009 and requires that couples filing jointly have amodified adjusted gross income (MAGI)of no more than $160,000 to be eligible for full credit.Couples who make $160,000 to $180,000, meanwhile, can apply for a partial AOTC.\n\nThe maximum reward is an annual credit of $2,500 onqualified educational expensesfor the first four years that a student attends an approved postsecondary institution.\n\nTheLifetime Learning Credit (LLC)allows parents to claim the amount spent on tuition and receive a 20% tax credit on the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, resulting in savings of up to $2,000 on each tax return. Qualifying tuition includes undergraduate, graduate, or professional degree courses.\n\nThere is an income limit to qualify for the LLC.For 2024, single filers must have a MAGI of $80,000 or less, while married couples filing jointly must have a MAGI of $160,000 or less to receive the full credit. Single filers with a MAGI of up to $90,000 and married couples filing jointly with a MAGI of up to $180,000 can receive partial credit\n\nA couple who files a separate tax return can also take deductions for their contributions to a traditionalindividual retirement account (IRA), but the income limits for taking them as a deduction if they or their spouse has a retirement plan at work are much lower than for those who file jointly.The maximum contribution permitted in 2024 is $7,000 and $8,000 for those aged 50 and over.\n\nAny expenses related tothe adoption of a qualifying childcan be taken if couples file jointly, but probably not if they file separately (check with a tax expert).The maximum credit allowed for adoptions is the total amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $16,810 in 2024.\n\nTax bills aside, there is one scenario in which married filing separately may be especially wise. If you don\u2019t want to be liable for your spouse\u2019s taxes and suspect that they are hiding income or claiming deductions or credits falsely, then filing separately is probably the best option.\n\nSigning a joint return means that both spouses are responsible for the accuracy of the return and for anytax liabilitiesor penalties that may apply. By signing your return and not a joint one, you are only responsible for the accuracy of the information on your return and for any tax liability and penalties that may ensue.\n\nIt\u2019s not necessary for married couples to declare their spouse\u2019s income\u00a0when filing separately\u2014unless they live in a community property state.\n\nYes, married couples are permitted to file jointly one year and separately the next year.\n\nMarried filing separately is the ideal tax filing status if both spouses want to keep their tax liabilities separate. But if you file separate returns, you miss out on a number of tax credits and deductions that are meant for married couples, such as the earned income tax credit and the American Opportunity Tax Credit.\n\nChoosing your tax filing status may be easy if you're single or widowed. But, if you're married, it may be a little more complicated. That's because you can file jointly or separately. If you file jointly, you can take advantage of certain tax credits and deductions. If, on the other hand, you don't want to be responsible for your spouse's taxes, consider filing your returns separately.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cThe Hows of Taxes: Module 5: Filing Status.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Newlyweds Tax Checklist.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cOther Deduction Questions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 555, Community Property: Married Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cBe Tax Ready \u2014 Understanding Tax Reform Changes Affecting Individuals and Families.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cAbout Publication 504, Divorced or Separated Individuals.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Direct File.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cAbout Publication 503, Child and Dependent Care Expenses.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cEducation Credits\u2014AOTC and LTC.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 503: Child and Dependent Care Expenses,\" Pages 7-8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 602 Child and Dependent Care Credit.\u201d\n\nCongress.gov. \"H.R.1 - American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cLifetime Learning Credit.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRA Deduction Limits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - IRA Contribution Limits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 607: Adoption Credit and Adoption Assistance Programs.\"",
