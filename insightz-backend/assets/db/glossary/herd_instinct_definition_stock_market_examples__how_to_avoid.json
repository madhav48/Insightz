  "term": "Herd Instinct: Definition, Stock Market Examples, & How to Avoid",
  "definition": "The term herd instinct refers to a phenomenon where people join groups and follow the actions of others under the assumption that other individuals have already done their research. Herd instincts are common in all aspects of society, even within thefinancial sector, where investors follow what they perceive other investors are doing, rather than relying on their own analysis.\n\nIn other words, an investor who exhibits herd instinct generally gravitates toward the same or similar investments as others. Herd instinct at scale can createasset bubblesor market crashes viapanic buyingandpanic selling.\n\nA herd instinct is a behavior wherein people tend toreact to the actions of others and follow their lead. This is similar to the way animals react in groups when they stampede in unison out of the way of danger\u2014perceived or otherwise. Herd instinct or herd behavior is distinguished by a lack of individual decision-making or introspection, causing those involved to think and behave in a similar fashion to everyone else around them.\n\nHuman beings are prone to a herd mentality, conforming to the activities and direction of others in multiple ways, from the way we shop to the way we invest. The fear of missing out on a profitableinvestmentidea is often the driving force behind herd instinct, especially in the wake of good news or after an analyst releases aresearch note. But this can be a mistake.\n\nHerd instinct, also known as herding, has a history of\u00a0starting large, unfounded market rallies and sell-offs that are often based on a lack of fundamental support to justify either. Herd instinct is a significant driver of asset bubbles (andmarket crashes) in financial markets.Thedotcom bubbleof the late 1990s and early 2000s is a prime example of the ramifications of herd instinct in the growth and subsequent bursting of that industry's bubble.\n\nBecause this type of behavior is instinctual, those who don't succumb to it can often feel distressed or fearful. If the crowd is generally going in one direction, an individual may feel they're wrong by going the opposite way. Or they may fear being singled out for not jumping on the bandwagon.\n\nWorking with a financial professional may help you curb your herd instincts so you can make sound financial decisions.\n\nWe all cherish our individuality and insist that we take responsibility for our own welfare by making decisions based on our own needs and wants. But it is natural for human beings to want to feel as though they're part of a community\u00a0of people with shared cultural and socioeconomic norms. So it shouldn't come as a surprise to find that it's just a part of human nature to follow the crowd.\n\nInvestors can be induced into following the herd, whether through buying at the top of a market rally or jumping off the ship in a marketsell-off.Behavioral financetheory attributes this conduct to the natural human tendency to be swayed by societal influences that trigger the fear of being alone or the fear of missing out.\n\nAnother motivating force behind crowd behavior is our tendency to look for leadership in the form of the balance of the crowd's opinion (we think that the majority must be right) or in the form of a few key individuals who seem to be driving the crowd's behavior by virtue of their uncanny ability to predict the future.\n\nIn times of uncertainty, we look to strong leaders to guide our behavior and provide examples to follow. The seemingly omniscient market guru is but one example of the type of individual who purports to stand as an all-knowing leader of the crowd, but whose fa\u00e7ade is the first to crumble when the tides of mania eventually turn.\n\nDon't be a lemming. An uninformed investor who exhibits herd mentality and invests without doing their own research often loses money.\n\nAn investmentbubbleoccurs when exuberant market behavior drives a rapid escalation in the price of an asset above and beyond itsintrinsic value. The bubble continues to inflate until the asset price reaches a level beyond fundamental and economical rationality.\n\nAt this stage in a bubble\u2019s existence, further increases in the cost of the asset often are contingent purely on investors continuing to buy in at the highest price. When investors are no longer willing to buy at that price level, the bubble begins to collapse. Inspeculativemarkets, the burst can incite\u00a0far-reaching corollary effects.\n\nSome bubbles occur organically, driven by investors who are overcome with optimism about a security\u2019s price increase and a\u00a0fear of being left behind as others realize significant gains. Speculators are drawn to invest, and thus\u00a0cause the security price and tradingvolumeto climb even higher.\n\nTheirrational exuberanceover dotcom stocks in the late 1990s was driven by cheap money, easy capital, market overconfidence, and over-speculation. It did not matter to investors that many dotcoms were generating no revenue, much less any profits. The herding instincts of investors made them anxious to pursue the nextinitial public offering (IPO)while completely overlooking the traditional fundamentals of investing. Just as the market peaked,investment capitalbegan to dry up, which led to the bursting of the bubble and steep investment losses.\n\nHerding may be instinctual but there are ways for you to avoid following the crowd, especially if you think you'll be making a mistake by doing so. It requires some discipline and a few considerations. Try following some of these suggestions:\n\nHerding or following the crowd can cause trends to amplify well-beyondfundamentals. As people pile into investments for fear of missing out, or because they have heard something positive but have not actually done their owndue diligence, prices can skyrocket. This irrational exuberance can lead to unstable asset bubbles that ultimately pop.\n\nIn reverse, sell-offs can turn into market crashes as people pile in to sell for no other reason than others are doing so, which can turn into panic selling.\n\nHerding behavior can have some benefits. It allows novice or uninformed investors to benefit from the due diligence and research of others. Passiveindex investing, for instance, is a herding-type strategy that relies on simply matching the broader market's performance.\n\nHerd instinct can also let the novice trader cut their losses early since it is\u00a0often better\u00a0to sell along with the\u00a0crowd than risk being abag holder.\n\nHerd instinct appears in several contexts and throughout human history. Aside from various asset bubbles and manias, herding can help explain mob behavior or riots, fads, conspiracy theories, mass delusions, political and social movements, sports fandom, and many others. For instance, people may rush out to buy the newest smartphone because of its popularity with other consumers.\n\nA good way to avoid this is to make investment decisions that are based on sound, objective criteria and not let emotions take over. Another way is to adopt acontrarian strategy, whereby you buy when others are panicking, picking up assets while they are on sale, and selling when euphoria leads to bubbles.\n\nAt the end of the day, it is human nature to be part of a crowd, and so it can be difficult to resist the urge to deviate from your plan.
