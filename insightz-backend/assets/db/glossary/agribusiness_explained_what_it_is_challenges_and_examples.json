  "term": "Agribusiness Explained: What It Is, Challenges, and Examples",
  "definition": "Agribusiness encompasses the economic sectors for farming and farming-related commerce. It involves all the steps for getting agricultural goods to the market, including production, processing,\u00a0and distribution. The industry is a traditional part of any economy, especially for countries with arable land and excess agricultural products for export.\n\nAgribusiness, as a sector, is all the different aspects of raising agricultural products as an integrated system. Trading farm goods is among the oldest human undertakings, but advances in the last century have made it a high-tech industry.Farmers raise animals and harvest fruits and vegetables with the help of sophisticated harvesting techniques, including using GPS to manage their operations. Manufacturers have developed increasingly automated machines that require very little labor. Processing plants are constantly renewing how they clean and package livestock to make production cleaner and more efficient.\n\nWhile consumers don't see each part of this industry, we rely on the sector's efforts to remain sustainable while aiming for lower food prices.\n\nMarket forces, such as changing consumer attitudes, and natural forces, such as changes in the earth's climate, significantly influence agribusiness.\n\nChanges in consumer taste alter what products are grown and raised. For example, shifting away from red meat might causedemand\u2014and therefore prices\u2014for beef to fall, changing how thousands of acres of farmland are used. Increased demand for produce may shift the mix of fruits and vegetables that farmers raise, requiring investments in irrigation systems and other ways of boosting production. Businesses unable to rapidly change with domestic demand often first look to export their products. If there's no market, they may be unable to compete and remain in business without pivoting to other crops.\n\nClimate change has increased the pressure on the need for sustainable practices in the industry, just as it's already adjusting to vast differences in worldwide weather patterns. But even short-term changes in weather patterns can have dramatic effects: an early frost in a citrus-growing region could cause a severe drop in that year's crop while less snowfall in a mountain region could mean a spring drought in surrounding valleys that depend upon the melted water for crop growth.\n\nThe regulatory environment also influences the agribusiness industry. Changes in approved chemicals and procedures or other legislation can cause market fluctuations.\n\nCountries with a large farming sector face constant pressure from global competition. Products such aswheat, corn,\u00a0and soybeansarecommoditiesthat are similar wherever they are grown, making one area's product easily replaceable by another's if it can get to market at a lower price. There are many other challenges faced by farmers:\n\nAll this represents a major challenge for agribusinesses, which face pressure to adopt more sustainable production methods. Finding ways to reduce emissions and adapt to a changing climate will be key to future success.\n\nThe use of new technology is vital to remain competitive in the global agribusiness sector. Farmers need to reduce crop costs and increase yield per square acre to stay competitive.\n\nSome farmers have adopted bee vectoring technology. This involves raising bees and using them as a delivery method for biocontrol agents, which can help protect plants from pests, fungi, and diseases.\n\nBees are key to agriculture, but populations have dropped in recent years. Almost half the honeybee colonies in the United States died between April 2022 and April 2023.This new technology can encourage more beekeeping and promote the growth of more colonies, while improving crop yields and fighting disease.\n\nElectronic drones have also played a greater role in agribusiness in recent years. Farmers have used drones for tasks like scouting for pests and diseases, monitoring water stress, screening plants, locating stray livestock, and gathering data for flood risk modeling.\n\nRobotics, GPS technology, and moisture sensors also help farmers improve worker safety and apply pesticides and fertilizers more easily across closely-targeted areas, and reduce wasted water.\n\nAgribusiness is a broad industry with a vast range of companies and operations. Agribusinesses include small family farms and multinational conglomerates in food production on a global scale.\n\nSome examples of agribusinesses include farm machine manufacturers, such as Deere & Company (DE); seed and agrochemical manufacturers, such as Bayer; food processing companies, such as Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (ADM); farmer's cooperatives; agritourism companies; and makers ofbiofuels, animal feeds, and other related products.\n\nAgriculture is the practice of raising crops, livestock, fish, trees, and other living organisms for food or other products. Agriculture has a long history\u2014it is widely believed that humans began practicing agriculture at the end of the last ice age.\n\nAgribusiness can be split into three major categories\u2014agriculture, livestock, and forestry.\n\nAgriculture includes activities like planting and harvesting crops. Livestock concerns raising animals for products like milk, eggs, or meat. Forestry involves planting, growing, and harvesting trees for construction, papermaking, and other purposes.\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, the top five products in the U.S. are corn, cattle, soybeans, dairy products, and broilers (chickens raised for food).The most profitable agribusinesses are likely involved in producing, processing, and marketing these products.\n\nAgribusiness will likely evolve because of the effects of climate change. Other changes underway include the rise of genetically modified crops and industry consolidation.\n\nAgribusiness is one of the world's oldest industries, with human agriculture beginning millennia ago. It is highly diverse and includes everyone from scientists developing new plants to industrial workers building farm equipment to laborers planting and harvesting food.\n\nThough the industry is facing major changes and challenges, largely because of climate change, it will continue to evolve as people's food needs change.\n\nThe World Bank. \"Agribusiness Trade as a Pillar of Development: Measurement and Patterns.\"\n\nUnited Nations Environment Program. \"Climate Risks in the Agriculture Sector.\"\n\nMohapatra, Shurti, et al. \"Climate Change and Vulnerability of Agribusiness: Assessment of Climate Change Impact on Agricultural Productivity.\"Frontiers in\u00a0Psychology, vol. 13, 2022.\n\nLynch, John, et al. \"Agriculture's Contribution to Climate Change and Role in Mitigation Is Distinct From Predominantly Fossil CO2-Emitting Sectors.\"Frontiers in Sustainable Food Systems, vol. 4, February 2021.\n\nShipp, Les, et al. \"Effect of Bee-Vectored Beauveria Bassiana on Greenhouse Beneficials Under Greenhouse Cage Conditions.\"Biological Control,vol. 63, no. 2, November 2012, pp. 135-142.\n\nBee Informed Partnership. \"United States Honey Bee Colony Losses 2022\u201323: Preliminary Results From the Bee Informed Partnership.\"\n\nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture. \"Using Drones in Agriculture and Natural Resources.\"\n\nNational Institute of Food and Agriculture. \"Agriculture Technology.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture. \"Farm Income and Wealth Statistics, Cash Receipts by State.\"",
