Discretionary expenses are costs without which businesses or households can survive. As such, they are defined as being wants rather than expenses that are needed. This means a business or household is still able to maintain itself even if all discretionaryconsumer spendingstops. Meals at restaurants and entertainment costs are examples of discretionary expenses.\n\nExpenses are divided into several categories, namely non-discretionary and discretionary. While non-discretionary expenses are considered mandatory\u2014housing,taxes,debt, and groceries\u2014discretionary expenses are incurred above and beyond what is deemed necessary. These are generally considered wants, while non-discretionary expenses are usually referred to as needs. As such, discretionary expenses rarely have anything to do with a business or household's day-to-day operations. Rather, they cater to choice and lifestyle.\n\nBusinesses and individuals pay for discretionary expenses withdiscretionary income\u2014the amount of money left over after paying for housing, food, taxes, and other necessities. When times are good, people have more money to spend, and they normally do so on things they don't need, such asluxury itemsand other services\u2014cars, vacations, restaurants, entertainment, electronics, etc.\n\nWhen times get tough and short-termcash flowissues emerge, managers and individuals often try to weed out any unnecessary costs. Discretionary expenses are normally the first to go because stopping them is unlikely to have a major impact on a business or household.\n\nCorporate discretionary expenses are usually linked to the promotion of a company\u2019smarketposition. Buying theraw materialsused to produce goods is usually considered essential. Spending money on employee training programs is not usually considered essential.\u00a0Individuals may also find times when they need to consider cutting out certain expenses. For example, a person who runs into financial difficulties is more likely to prioritize paying utility bills over financing a vacation.\n\nUnderstanding and identifying your non-discretionary and discretionary expenses\u2014and which ones matter most to you\u2014can help you save, set your goals, and plan for your financial future.\n\nWhat constitutes a discretionary expense is subjective. As such, it may differ considerably among individuals and businesses.\n\nFor example, a stable, well-established company could probably get away with slashing itsadvertisingbudget for a while if the need arises. A new company facing hardship, on the other hand, would probably need to makecutbackselsewhere, being mindful that boosting exposure and getting its name out there is imperative to keeping the business afloat.\n\nThe same principle applies to individual consumers as well. Some people may only be able to afford a daily Starbucks run when things are going well. They may consider cutting out this expense when times are tough\u2014or if they're saving up for a big expense, like a home or a car.\n\nAs mentioned above, discretionary expenses are any costs that a consumer or business wants rather than needs. Some common discretionary items include:\n\nIt's important to point out again that what defines a discretionary expense depends on who's doing the buying. For instance, buying a new car may be considered a want for one person, but it may be considered essential for someone who has a longcommuteto work where driving is the only option.\n\nIt may be necessary for households and businesses to cut back on certain expenditures in response to decreases inincomeduring tough economic times. That's why it's a good idea to track discretionary expenses separately from essential ones so that it is easy to see how costs can be reduced.\n\nOne helpful budgeting tactic is to rank discretionary expenses in order of importance from the least to most important. If a job loss or income reduction forcesbudgetcuts, household members or a company's management team can easily identify the first discretionary expense to place on the chopping block.\n\nExpenses are divided into discretionary and non-discretionary costs. In other words, essential and non-essential expenses. Some expenses, such as vacation costs andluxury items, are not necessary to maintain a household and, thus, are classified as discretionary expenses. The income earner can pay for these goods or services at their discretion.\n\nCertain expenses, though, must be paid to keep things running. These are called non-discretionary expenses. These are considered essential expenses, as the income earner must regularly pay them or suffer the consequences.\n\nExamples of non-discretionary spending include housing costs, taxes, andhealth insurancefor individuals.Payroll, warehousing costs, and transport are non-discretionary expenses for businesses.\n\nDiscretionary funds is a term used to describe the money an individual or business has left over to spend on non-essential goods and services. This money is left over after an individual, household, or organization pays for essential costs. For instance, governments may use discretionary funds for small-scale projects after taking care of all essential services.\n\nDiscretionary expenses are expenses paid for by individuals or businesses that aren't essential to their day-to-day lives or operations. These costs may not be predictable and can change over time. Fixed expenses, on the other hand, are costs that are incurred regularly. These are predictable, which means households and businesses can count on them being the same (or roughly the same) each period. Examples of fixed costs are housing and rent, insurance, and utilities.\n\nThe termdiscretionary incomerefers to the total income left after a household or business pays for necessities, including taxes, housing, groceries, and utilities. This type of income is used to maintain a certainstandard of livingor operations. As such, discretionary income can be used to pay for things like vacations, luxury items, and savings.\n\nCosts are divided into several categories. Some are essential while others are not. The first, which includes essential and mandatory items, are called non-discretionary expenses. This is contrasted to discretionary expenses. These costs are deemed non-essential, such as vacations, luxury goods, and nights out. Discretionary spending happens when all non-discretionary costs are covered. Keep in mind that these are needs and can be sacrificed when times get tough.\n\nExperian. \"What Is Discretionary Spending?\"",
