  "term": "What Is a Smurf and How Does Smurfing Work?",
  "definition": "A smurf is a colloquial term for a money launderer who seeks to evade scrutiny from government agencies by breaking up large transactions into a set of smaller transactions that are each below the reporting threshold. Smurfing is an illegal activity that can have serious consequences.\n\nCurrent bank regulations require banks or other financial institutions to report cash transactions exceeding $10,000\u2014or any others they deem suspicious\u2014on asuspicious activity report(SAR).\n\nSmurfing involves depositing illegally gained money into multiple bank accounts for under-the-radar transfer in the near future.\n\nTo prevent money laundering by criminals involved in illegal activities, such as drugs and extortion, countries such as the United States and Canada require acurrency transaction reportto be filed by a financial institution handling any transaction exceeding $10,000 in cash.\n\nTo evade these reporting requirements, criminal groups might attempt to cover their tracks by splitting their cash into multiple smaller deposits and dividing them between a number of geographically dispersed accounts. This is a form ofstructuring transactionsto avoid regulatory detection.\n\nShortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, theUSA Patriot Actexpandedanti-money-laundering measuresby allowing investigative tools designed for organized crime and drug trafficking prevention to be used in terrorist investigations and making reporting of transactions of $10,000 or more mandatory.\n\nSmurfing takes place in three stages: placement, layering, and integration. In the placement stage, the criminal is relieved of guarding large amounts of illegally obtained cash by placing it into the financial system. For example, a smurf may pack cash in a suitcase and smuggle it to another country for gambling, buying international currency, or other reasons.\n\nDuring the layeringstage, illicit money is separated from its source by a sophisticated layering of financial transactions that obscures the audit trail and breaks the link to the original crime. For example, a smurf may move funds electronically from one country to another, then divide the money into investments placed in advanced financial options or overseas markets.\n\nThe integrationstage is when the money is returned to the criminal. Although there are numerous ways of getting the money back, funds must appear to come from a legitimate source, and the process must not draw attention. For example, valuables such as property, artwork, jewelry, or high-end automobiles may be purchased and given to the criminal.\n\nOne way criminals move money internationally is known as \u201ccuckoo smurfing.\u201d Suppose that a New York criminal owes a London criminal $9,000, and a London merchant owes a New York supplier $9,000.\n\nThe London merchant and the New York supplier do not know the funds were never directly transferred. All they know is that the London merchant paid $9,000 and the New York supplier received $9,000. However, if caught, theLondon banker could face serious consequences.\n\nAnother common method is structuring transactions with a group of accomplices, each with their own bank accounts. For example, a person might have $50,000 to send abroad, which would ordinarily trigger aCurrency Transaction Reportand call attention to the source of their income. In order to avoid a CTR, that person could have ten accomplices make bank transfers of $5,000 each. Even if the money is legally sourced, the act of dividing the transaction to avoid being reported is itself a crime.\n\nThere is no general law against handling large sums of money. However, the act of structuring transactions to evade federal reporting limits is a serious crime, even if the money is legally sourced.\n\nThe name \"Smurf\" appears to be borrowed from illicit methamphetamine manufacturers. In order to accumulate regulated precursor chemicals, drug manufacturers will often send accomplices to make multiple purchases at multiple locations, without exceeding the legal purchasing limits.\n\nIn finance, Smurfing refers to the practice of avoiding regulatory scrutiny by dividing a large sum of money into multiple smaller transactions, sometimes divided into multiple different accounts.\n\nSmurfing is a form of money-laundering which may allow criminal groups to move illegally acquired money into the regulated financial system.\n\nUnrelated to financial Smurfing, in cybersecurity Smurfing refers to a Distributed Denial-of-Service Attack in which multiple servers are tricked into communicating with the targetall at once. Although each contact is small, the cumulative effect is to make the target's network unusable.",
