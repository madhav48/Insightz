That is, the recipient acknowledges that the goods have been delivered by signing the document. Of course, there are different kinds of bills of lading, each type with unique stipulations and conditions.\u00a0For example, theocean bill of ladingapplies only to cargo that is shipped across international waters.\n\nA negotiable bill of landing can be transferred\u00a0to a third party throughconsignment. This happens when the consignee (the person or entity that is the buyer and is financially responsible for the goods)\u00a0signs or endorses the document and delivers it to the new consignee (the third party).\u00a0To transfer the negotiable bill of lading, the consignor (the person or business shipping the goods) must stamp and sign the bill.
