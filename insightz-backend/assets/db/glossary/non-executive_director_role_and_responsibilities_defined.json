They must act in the interest of corporate stakeholders.\n\nNon-executive directors are put in place to challenge the direction and performance of acompanyas well as its existing team.\n\nSince non-executive directors do not holdC-levelor managerial positions, they are thought to understand the interests of the company with greater objectivity than the executive directors, who may have anagency problem\u2014that is, a potential conflict of interest between management and shareholders or otherstakeholders.\n\nAlso known as external directors, independent directors, and outside directors, non-executive directors are often installed on a firm\u2019s board forpublic relationsreasons. For instance, a particular non-executive director\u2019s community standing, record ofphilanthropy, and prior experience could provide positive exposure and symbolic value for the firm.\n\nAlthough they aren\u2019t employees, non-executive directors may still be compensated for their time. They can be paid through fees, cash, or equity compensation. The amount they are paid depends on the industry, the size of the company, and the amount of time they spend doing work for the corporation.\n\nNon-executive directors are equally liable for the success or failure of a business, as outlined by statutory requirements and tax laws.\n\nAs a function of their leadership role, non-executive directors are required to embody certain key values.
