Brick-and-mortar stores can offer experience shopping whereby consumers can test a product such as a video game or laptop at Best Buy or have lunch in Nordstrom's cafe while shopping at the store.

However, Costco is bucking the trend.\n\nCostco Wholesale Corporation(COST)is a membership retailer that charges an annual fee of between $60 and $120 to each customer. Consumers receive cost savings and service benefits for being a member. Costco had over 127 million members and a 92.7% renewal rate in the United States and Canada at the end of fiscal year 2023.\n\nCostco is the top third retailer in 2023, according to the National Retail Federation.Costco sells 10,000 products on its website and offers consumers the option to buy goods online and pick them up in the store, which helps offer its members a compelling alternative to Amazon.\n\nThere are several areas where brick-and-mortar stores still provide a resilient business model.
