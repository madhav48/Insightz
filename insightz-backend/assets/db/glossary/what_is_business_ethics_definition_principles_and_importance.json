  "definition": "Business ethics is the moral principles, policies, and values that govern the way companies and individuals engage in business activity. It goes beyond legal requirements to establish a code of conduct that drives employee behavior at all levels and helps build trust between a business and its customers.\n\nBusiness ethics ensure that a certain basic level of trust exists between consumers and various forms of market participants with businesses. For example, aportfolio managermust give the same consideration to the portfolios of family members and small individual investors as they do to wealthier clients. These kinds of practices ensure\u00a0the public receives fair treatment.\n\nThe concept of business ethics began in the 1960s as corporations became more aware of a rising consumer-based society that showed concerns regarding the environment, social causes, and corporate responsibility. The increased focus on \"social issues\" was a hallmark of the decade.\n\nSince that time, the concept of business ethics has evolved. Business ethics goes beyond just a moral code of right and wrong; it attempts to reconcile what companies must do legally vs. maintaining acompetitive advantageover other businesses. Firms display business ethics in several ways.\n\nBusiness ethics ensure a certain level of trust between consumers and corporations, guaranteeing the public fair and equal treatment.\n\nThere are generally 12 business ethics principles:\n\nThere are several reasons business ethics areessentialfor success in modern business. Most importantly, defined ethics programs establish a code of conduct that drives employee behavior\u2014from executives to middle management to the newest and youngest employees.\n\nWhen all employees make ethical decisions, the company establishes a reputation for ethical behavior. Its reputation grows, and it begins to experience the benefits a moral establishment reaps, such as:\n\nWhen combined, all these factors affect a business' revenues. Those who fail to set ethical standards and enforce them are doomed to eventually find themselves alongside Enron, Arthur Andersen, Wells Fargo, Lehman Brothers, Bernie Madoff, and many others.\n\nThere are various types of business ethics. What mainly makes a business stand out are itscorporate social responsibilitypractices, transparency and trustworthiness, fairness, and technological practices.\n\nCorporate social responsibility (CSR) is the concept of meeting the needs of stakeholders while accounting for the impact meeting those needs has on employees, the environment, society, and the community in which the business operates. Finances and profits are important, but they should be secondary to the welfare of society, customers, and employees. In fact, studies have concluded that corporate governance and ethical practices increase financial performance.\n\nA greater focus on business ethics is an expense that tends to pay off. Over time, it boosts revenues and limits damaging lawsuits.\n\nIt's essential for companies to ensure they are reporting theirfinancial performancein a way that is transparent. This not only applies to required financial reports but all reports in general.\n\nMost of these reports outline not only the submitted reports to regulators, but how and why decisions were made, if goals were met, and factors that influenced performance. CEOs write summaries of the company's annual performance and give their outlooks.\n\nPress releases are another way companies can be transparent. Events important to investors and customers should be published, regardless of whether it is good or bad news.\n\nThe growing use of technology of all forms in business operations inherently comes with a need to ensure the technology and information being gathered is used ethically. Additionally, it should ensure that the technology issecuredto the utmost of its ability, especially as many businesses store customer information and collect data that those with nefarious intentions can use.\n\nA workplace should be inclusive, diverse, and fair for all employees regardless of race, religion, beliefs, age, or identity. A fair work environment is where everyone can grow, be promoted, and become successful in their own way.\n\nFostering an environment of ethical behavior and decision-making takes time and effort and starts at the top. Most companies need to create a code of conduct/ethics, guiding principles, reporting procedures, and training programs to enforce and encourage ethical behavior.\n\nOnce conduct is defined and programs are implemented, continuous communication with employees becomes vital. Leaders should constantly encourage employees to report concerning behavior. Additionally, there should be assurances that whistle-blowers will not face adversarial actions.\n\nA pipeline for anonymous reporting can help businesses identify questionable practices and reassure employees that they will not face any consequences for reporting an issue.\n\nTo preventunethical behaviorand repair its adverse side effects, companies often look to managers and employees to report any unethical acts they observe or experience. However, barriers within the company culture (such as fear of retaliation for reporting misconduct) can prevent this from happening.\n\nPublished by the Ethics & Compliance Initiative (ECI), the annual Global Business Ethics Survey reaches out to thousands of employees in 42 countries about various ethics-related topics, including the strength of the ethics culture in their workplace, whether they have witnessed any misconduct where they work, and if their employer is making efforts to promote integrity.\n\nIn the 2023 survey, published in May 2024, 65% of the employees surveyed said they had observed at least one act deemed to be a violation of their organization\u2019s standards or the law in the past 12 months and 72% of them said they had reported it. Worryingly, 46% of these employees then went on to admit that they had been retaliated against for raising concerns.\n\nIndeed, fear of retaliation is one of the primary reasons employees cite for not reporting unethical behavior in the workplace. ECI says companies should work toward improving theircorporate cultureby reinforcing the idea that reporting suspected misconduct is beneficial to the company. Additionally, they should acknowledge and reward the employee's courage in making the report.\n\nBusiness ethics concerns ethical dilemmas or controversial issues faced by a company. Often, business ethics involve a system of practices and procedures that help build trust with the consumer. On one level, some business ethics are embedded in the law, such as minimum wages, insider trading restrictions, and environmental regulations. On another, business ethics can be influenced by management behavior, with wide-ranging effects across the company.\n\nBusiness ethics guide executives, managers, and employees in their daily actions and decision-making. For example, consider a company that has decided to dump chemical waste that it cannot afford to dispose of properly on a vacant lot it has purchased in the local community. This action has legal, environmental, and social repercussions that can damage a company beyond repair.\n\nBusiness ethics is an evolving topic. Generally, there are about 12 ethical principles: honesty, fairness, leadership, accountability, integrity, compassion, respect, responsibility, loyalty, respect for the law, transparency, and environmental concerns.\n\nBusiness ethics concerns employees, customers, society, the environment, shareholders, and stakeholders. Therefore, every business should develop ethical models and practices that guide employees in their actions and ensure they prioritize the interests and welfare of those the company serves.\n\nDoing so creates a positive work environment and builds trust with consumers and business partners, which can all contribute to higher revenues and profits.\n\nEthics & Compliance Initiative. \"Timeline of Business Ethics and Compliance.\"\n\nNew York University Stern Center for Sustainable Business. \"ESG and Financial Performance: Uncovering the Relationship By Aggregating Evidence From 1,000 Plus Studies Published Between 2015 \u2013 2020.\"\n\nWashington State University. \"3 Reasons an Ethical Business Leads to Profits.\"\n\nEthics & Compliance Initiative (ECI). \"The Global Business Ethics Survey.\"",
