  "term": "Watercraft Insurance: What It is, How It Works",
  "definition": "Watercraft insurance is an umbrella term for three types of insurance:boat insurance,yacht insurance, and personal watercraft insurance. It protects against damages to vessels powered by a motor that has a horsepower of at least 25 miles per hour (mph). Examples of the types of costs covered by watercraft insurance policies include physical loss or damage to the boat, theft of the boat, and towing.\n\nDepending on the policy, there may also be watercraftliability coveragefor bodily injury to people other than the boat\u2019s owner and family, guest passengers using the boat by themselves, and medical payments for injury to the owner and their family. Some policies, however, require the purchase of additional liability coverage as an add-on. The specific type of insurance you buy is dictated by the size of your vessel.\n\nWatercraft insurance is similar to other types of insurance products. In exchange for paying a series of insurance premiums, the policyholder receives protection from certain rare but potentially costly risks. Depending on factors such as the size of the craft, its age, and its intended uses, the premium costs may range from relatively inexpensive to pricey. When underwriting a policy, an insurance company will also consider the policyholder\u2019s track record of previous claims.\n\nAny vessel under 197 feet long is considered a boat, while ships are 197 feet or longer. The dividing line between boat and yacht is less settled. Some sources define a yacht as at least 30 feet long. Anything shorter is a pleasure boat.For insurance purposes, the National Boat Owners Association marks the dividing line at 27 feet.\n\nSmall craft, such as canoes, rowboats, small sailboats, and powerboats with less than 25 miles-per-hour horsepower may be covered under a standardhomeownersorrenter\u2019s insurancepolicy. However, such coverage is unlikely to include liability insurance. Typical boat insurance covers theft; physical damage to the boat itself due to a collision or striking a submerged object; property damage to the boat caused by vandalism, a windstorm, or lightning; and medical payments for injured passengers and the owner and their family. For each coverage, there will be different deductibles, which is how much you must pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in. Boat insurance will often provide better liability insurance than a homeowners policy, but it is often wise to purchase additional liability coverage as an add-on.\n\nIn the event of a total loss, it is important to know whether your policy paysactual cash value (ACV)or agreed value (AV). ACV is cheaper because it only pays for what the boat was worth at the time of the loss, factoring indepreciationand wear and tear on the vessel. AV pays a price that you and your insurer agree upon in advance, an amount that is likely to be closer to the amount you paid for the boat when new.\n\nOther considerations for boat insurance can include:\n\nMost yacht coverage is broader and more specialized than pleasure boat coverage because larger vessels travel farther and are exposed to greater risks. It also generally costs more,in part because yachts cost more. In terms of a deductible, it is usually determined as a\u00a0percentage of the insured value. With a 1% deductible, a boat insured for $175,000 would have a $1,750 deductible. Most lenders allow a maximum deductible of 2%\u00a0of the insured value.\n\nGenerally, yacht insurance coverage does not include\u00a0wear and tear, gradual deterioration, marine life, marring, denting, scratching, animal damage, osmosis, blistering, electrolysis, manufacturer\u2019s defects, defects in design, and ice and freezing.\n\nThere are two main parts\u00a0of a yacht insurance policy: hull insurance and protection and indemnity (P&I). The first is an all-risk, direct damage coverage that includes an AV for hull coverage, and in the case of a total loss, it will be paid out in full.Replacement costcoverage on partial losses is also available. However, sails, canvas, batteries, outboards, and sometimes outdrives are usually subject to depreciation instead.\n\nP&I insurance is the broadest of all liability coverages, and because maritime law is particular, you will need coverages that are designed for those exposures. Longshore and harbor workers\u2019 coverage andJones Actcoverage (for the yacht\u2019s crew) are included and are important because your losses in these areas could run into six figures. P&I will cover any judgments against you and also pay for your defense inadmiralty courts.\n\nPersonal watercraft insurance is for recreational vehicles such as Jet Skis, Sea-Doos, and Yamaha Wave Runners. These surface-skimming craft can have engines with horsepower anywhere from 60 mph to 310 mph. They usually are not covered by homeowners insurance, and even when they are, the coverage limits are low.\n\nPersonal watercraft insurance covers the owner and anyone they allow to use the craft for risks such as:\ufeff\n\nDeductibles and liability limits will vary depending upon the policy and the company offering it. You can buy additional coverage for trailers and accessories and, if you own more than one craft, you may be able tobundleyour insurance policies for a discount. These pleasure vehicles are easy to use but can also be dangerous, causing thousands of injuries every year, which makes personal watercraft insurance a wise investment.\ufeff\n\nWatercraft insurance policies may limit the geographic areas in which the boat or watercraft can be operated while maintaining coverage. These often include inland waterways, rivers, and lakes, as well as ocean waters within a certain number of miles from shore.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOnly a few states make it mandatory for boat owners to obtain watercraft insurance. However, many owners will opt to purchase it regardless, partly because doing so is requiredin order to obtain a boat loan. Marinas may also require owners to have watercraft insurance as a condition within their rental agreements.\n\nEven if your craft isn\u2019t worth much money, obtaining watercraft insurance is a good idea because of the risk of injury on the water, especially from a collision. Even if you aren\u2019t at fault, you could spend a lot of money in legal fees defending yourself\u2014much more than your insurance premiums. If you do decide to purchase this insurance, make a point of comparing policies from multiple companies before deciding on which is best for you. As with all insurance, the question is what price you put on having peace of mind.\n\nInsurance Information Institute. \"I.I.I.: Know Your Boat\u2019s Insurance Coverage from Stem to Stern.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nWestlawn Institute of Marine Technology. \"Definitions of: Boat, Yacht, Small Craft, and Related Terms.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nNational Boat Owners Association (NBOA). \"The Best Yacht Insurance Rates.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nDiscoverBoating.com. \"Boat Insurance Guide: Boat Insurance Coverage FAQs: What is a normal deductible?\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nNational Marine Lenders Association. \"Insurance: Large Boats: What\u2019s Not Covered?\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nDiscoverBoating.com. \"Boat Insurance Guide.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.\n\nBoat Owners Association of the United States (BoatUS). \"Do I Need Boat Insurance?\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2022.",
