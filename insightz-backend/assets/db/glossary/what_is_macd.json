  "term": "What Is MACD?",
  "definition": "The moving average convergence/divergence indicator helps investors identify price trends\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nMoving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is atechnical indicatorto help investors identify price trends, measure trend momentum, and identify entry points for buying or selling. Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD) is atrend-followingmomentumindicator that shows the relationship between twoexponential moving averages (EMAs)of asecurity\u2019sprice. MACD was developed in the 1970s by Gerald Appel, and is one of the most popular technical tools, readily available on most trading platforms offered byonline stock brokers.\n\nThe MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The calculation creates the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called thesignal line, plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals.\n\nTraders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell\u2014or short\u2014the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods arecrossovers,divergences, and rapid rises/falls.\n\nMACD=12-Period\u00a0EMA\u221226-Period\u00a0EMA\\text{MACD}=\\text{12-Period EMA }-\\text{ 26-Period EMA}MACD=12-Period\u00a0EMA\u221226-Period\u00a0EMA\n\nMACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is amoving average (MA)that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.\n\nThe exponential moving average is an exponentiallyweightedmoving average. An exponentially weighted moving average tends to have more significant reactions to recent price changes than asimple moving average (SMA).\n\nMACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line on the MACD chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart), and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The distance between MACD and itsbaselinedepends on the distance between the two EMAs.\n\nAs shown in the chart below, rises and drops in MACD (blue) values correspond to the movements of the two EMA lines.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nMACD is often displayed with ahistogram(see the next chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD\u2019s baseline or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD\u2019s baseline. Traders use the MACD\u2019s histogram to identify peaks of bullish or bearish momentum, and to generate overbought/oversold trade signals.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nTherelative strength index (RSI)signals whether an instrument is consideredoverboughtoroversoldbased on its recent price action. The RSI is anoscillator that calculates the averageprice gains and losses over a given period. The default is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top or a bottom is forming.\n\nUnlike the RSI or other oscillator studies, the MACD lines do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels. Rather, they function on a relative basis. An investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below.\n\nMACD measures the relationship between two EMAs to indicate momentum and potential trade reversals, while the RSI seeks out overbought and oversold conditions by evaluating recent price action. These indicators are often used together to giveanalystsa more complete technical picture.\n\nBoth measure the momentum of an instrument, but they measure different factors. The two can sometimes give contradictory results. The RSI may show a reading above 70 (overbought) for a sustained period, indicating an instrument is overextended to the buy side. In contrast, the MACD may indicate that the instrument\u2019s buy-side momentum is still growing. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).\n\nA moving average divergence can signal a possible reversal, but it will also produce numerous \u2018false positives\u2019 along the way. False positive divergences often occur when the price of an asset moves sideways in a consolidation, such as in arangeortriangle pattern. A slowdown in the momentum\u2014sideways movement or slow trending movement\u2014of the price will cause MACD to pull away from its prior extremes and gravitate toward the zero lines even in the absence of a true reversal.\n\nConfirmation should be sought by trend-following indicators, such as theDirectional Movement Index (DMI) systemand its key component, theAverage Directional Index (ADX). The ADX is designed to indicate whether a trend is in place, with a reading above 25 indicating a trend is in place (in either direction) and a reading below 20 suggesting no trend is in place.\n\nInvestors following MACD crossovers and divergences may double-check with the ADX before trusting a MACD signal. While MACD may show a bearish divergence, a check of the ADX may indicate that an uptrend is still in place. Such a doublecheck may help investors avoid the false bearish MACD trade signal and allow them to wait and see how the market develops. If MACD shows a bearish crossover and the ADX is in non-trending territory (<25) and has likely shown a peak and reversal, investors may be more willing to take the bearish trade.\n\nAs shown on the following chart, when MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal indicating that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when MACD rises above the signal line, the signal is bullish, suggesting that the asset's price might experience upward momentum. Crossovers are more reliable when they conform to the prevailing trend. If MACD crosses above its signal line after a brief downside correction within a longer-term uptrend, it qualifies as a bullish confirmation and the likely continuation of the uptrend.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nIf MACD crosses below its signal line following a brief move higher within a longer-term downtrend, traders would consider that a bearish confirmation.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nWhen MACD forms highs or lows that exceed the corresponding highs and lows in the instrument\u2019s price, it is called a divergence. A bullish divergence appears when MACD forms two rising lows that correspond with two falling lows on the price. This is often a valid bullish signal when the long-term trend is still positive.\n\nSome traders will look for bullish divergences even when the long-term trend is negative because they can signal a change in the trend, although this technique is less reliable.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nWhen MACD forms a series of two falling highs that correspond with two rising highs on the price, a bearish divergence has been formed. A bearish divergence that appears during a long-term bearish trend is considered confirmation that the trend is likely to continue.\n\nSome traders will watch for bearish divergences during long-term bullish trends because they can signal weakness in the trend. However, it is not as reliable as a bearish divergence during a bearish trend.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nWhen MACD rises or falls rapidly (the shorter-term moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average), it signals that the security is overbought or oversold and may soonretraceto normal levels. Traders often combine this analysis with the RSI or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nIt is not uncommon for investors to use the MACD\u2019s histogram the same way they may use the MACD itself. Positive or negative crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises or falls can be identified on the histogram. Some experience is needed before deciding which is best in any given situation because there are timing differences between signals on the MACD and its histogram.\n\nTradersuse MACD to identify changesin the direction or strength of a stock\u2019s price trend. MACD can seem complicated at first glance because it relies on additional statistical concepts such as the exponential moving average (EMA), but fundamentally, MACD helps traders detect when the recent momentum in a stock\u2019s price may be starting to fade. This can help traders decide when to enter, add to, or exit a position.\n\nMACD is a lagging indicator. The data used in MACD calculation is based on the historical price action, therefore MACD readings lag the price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator of future trend changes.\n\nA MACD positive (or bullish) divergence is a situation in which MACD does not reach a new low, despite the price of the stock reaching a new low. This is seen as a bullish trading signal\u2014hence, the term \u201cpositive/bullish divergence.\u201d If the opposite scenario occurs\u2014the stock price reaches a new high, but MACD fails to do so\u2014this would be seen as a bearish indicator and termed \u201cnegative/bearish divergence.\u201d In both cases, the setups suggest that the move higher/lower will not last, so investors need to look at other technical studies, like the relative strength index (RSI).\n\nMACD is a moving average,best used with daily data. Just as a crossover of the nine- and 14-day SMAs may generate a trading signal for some traders, a crossover of the MACD above or below its signal line may also generate a directional signal. MACD is based on EMAs with more weight placed on the most recent data, which means that it can react very quickly to changes of direction in the current price move. Crossovers of MACD lines should be noted, but confirmation should be sought from other technical signals, such as the RSI, or perhaps a fewcandlestickprice charts. Because it is a lagging indicator, MACD argues that confirmation in subsequent price action should develop before taking the signal.\n\nCMT Association. \"Gerald Appel.\"",
