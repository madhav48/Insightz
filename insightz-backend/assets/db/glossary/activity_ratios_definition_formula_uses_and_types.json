  "definition": "Several activity ratios are used to measure a company's success in turning its assets into revenue, such as its efficiency in converting inventory into sales.\n\nStock analysts examine several activity ratios that indicate how efficient a company is at turning its assets into revenue. Commonly referred to as efficiency ratios, they help analysts gauge how a company handlesinventory management, which is key to its operational fluidity and overall fiscal health.\n\nThere are several categories of activity ratios related to accounts receivable, inventory turnover, return on equity, and asset turnover.\n\nActivity ratios are most useful when employed to compare two competing businesses within the sameindustry, to determine how a particular company stacks up among its peers. But activity ratios may also be used to track a company\u2019s fiscal progress over multiple recording periods, to detect changes over time. These numbers can be mapped to present a forward-looking picture of a company\u2019s prospective performance.\n\nActivity ratios can be broken down into the following subcategories:\n\nTheaccounts receivable turnover ratiodetermines an entity\u2019s ability to collect money from its customers. Total credit sales are divided by the average accounts receivable balance for a specific period. A low ratio suggests a deficiency in the collection process.\n\nThe merchandise inventory turnover ratio measures how often theinventorybalance is sold during anaccounting period. Thecost of goods sold (COGS)is divided by theaverage inventoryfor a specific period. Higher calculations suggest that a company can move its inventory with relative ease.\n\nThe total assets turnover ratio measures how efficiently an entity uses its assets to tender a sale. Total sales are divided by total assets to decipher how proficiently a business uses its assets. Smaller ratios may indicate that a company is struggling to move its products.\n\nA performance metric known asreturn on equity (ROE)measures the revenues raised from shareholder equity. ROE is calculated by dividing net income by all outstanding stock shares in the market.\n\nA metric called theasset turnover ratiomeasures the amount of revenue that a company generates per dollar of assets. This figure, which is simply calculated by dividing a company\u2019s sales by its total assets, reveals how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate sales.\n\nActivity ratios andprofitability ratiosare both fundamental analytical tools that help investors evaluate different facets of a company's fiscal strength. Profitability ratios depict a company\u2019s profit generation, while activity ratios measure how well a company utilizes its resources to generate thoseprofits. Profitability ratios may help analysts compare a company\u2019s profits with those of its industry competitors, while also tracking the same company\u2019s progress across several different reporting periods.\n\nActivity ratios are most useful when they compare two competing businesses within the same industry, to determine how a particular company stacks up among its peers.\n\nActivity ratio subcategories, described earlier in this article, are:\n\nAn activity ratio measures how well a company utilizes its resources to generate those profits, while a profitability ratio depicts a company\u2019s profit generation.\n\nAn activity ratio, commonly called an efficiency ratio, indicates how efficiently a company is leveraging the assets on itsbalance sheet, to generate revenues and cash.
