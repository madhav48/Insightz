  "term": "What Are Bond Ratings? Definition, Effects, and Agencies",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nBond ratings are assessments by rating agencies of how likely a bond issuer is to repay their debt on time, portrayed through a letter grade.\n\nA bond rating is a way to measure the creditworthiness of a bond, which corresponds to the cost of borrowing for an issuer. These ratings typically assign a letter grade to bonds that indicate theircredit quality.\n\nPrivate independent rating services such as S&P Global Ratings, Moody\u2019s Ratings, and Fitch Ratings evaluate a bond issuer's financial strength, or its ability to pay a bond's principal and interest, in a timely fashion.\n\nMost bonds carry ratings provided by at least one of the following three chief independent rating agencies:\n\nTo determine abond's rating, these agencies conduct a thorough financial analysis of a bond's issuing body, whether they are U.S. Treasuries or bonds from international corporations.\n\nBased on each agency\u2019s individual set of criteria, analysts determine the entity\u2019s ability to pay their bills and remain liquid, while also taking into consideration a bond's future expectations and outlook. The agencies then declare a bond's overall rating, based on the collection of these data points.\n\nThis helps investors determine how risky a bond is before investing, allowing them to gauge default risk. Higher-rated bonds are safer, meaning they are less likely to default, and because of this, come with lower yields. Conversely, lower-rated bonds are riskier with a higher chance of defaulting, but due to the higher risk, their return is also higher.\n\nBond ratings are vital to alerting investors to the quality and stability of the bond in question. These ratings consequently greatly influence interest rates, investment appetite, and bond pricing.\n\nHigher-rated bonds, known as investment grade bonds, are viewed as safer and more stable investments. Such offerings are tied to publicly traded corporations and government entities that boast positive outlooks.\n\nInvestment gradebonds contain \u201cAAA\u201d to \u201cBBB-\" ratings from S&P and Fitch, and \"Aaa\" to \"Baa3\" ratings from Moody\u2019s. Investment grade bonds usually see bond yields increase as ratings decrease. U.S. Treasury bonds are the most common AAA-rated bond securities.\n\nNon-investment grade bonds (junk bonds) usually carry ratings of \u201cBB+\u201d to \u201cD\u201d for S&P and Fitch, and \"Baa1\" to \"C\" for Moody\u2019s. In some cases, bonds of this nature are given \u201cnot rated\u201d status.\n\nAlthough bonds carrying these ratings are deemed to be higher-risk investments, they nevertheless attract certain investors who are drawn to the high yields they offer. Some junk bonds are saddled with liquidity issues, however, and can feasibly default, leaving investors with nothing.\n\nIn August 2023, Fitch Ratings downgraded the long-term ratings of the United States to \"AA+\" from \"AAA\" due to the anticipated fiscal deterioration over the next three years, increasing government debt burden, and the erosion of governance related to \"AA\" and \"AAA\" rated peers over the last two decades that has resulted in repeat debt limit standoffs and 11th-hour resolutions.\n\nIn May 2025, Moody's downgraded the U.S. long-term issuer rating from \"Aaa\" to \"Aa1.\" The primary reason for the downgrade was increased government debt and interest payment ratios over the past decade, which are much higher than similarly rated countries.\n\nMany Wall Street watchers believe that the independent bond rating agencies played a pivotal role in contributing to the2008 economic downturn.\n\nIn fact, it came to light that during the lead-up to the crisis, rating agencies were bribed to provide falsely high bond ratings, thereby inflating their worth. One example of this fraudulent practice occurred in 2008 when Moody's downgraded 83% of $869 billion in mortgage-backed securities, which were given a rating of \"AAA\" just the year before.\n\nIn short: long-term investors should carry the majority of their bond exposure in more reliable, income-producing bonds that carry investment grade bond ratings. Speculators and distressed investors who make a living off of high-risk, high-reward opportunities, should consider turning to non-investment grade bonds.\n\nBonds with lower ratings have a greater risk of default than bonds with higher ratings. These bonds tend to have higher yields so as to still be able to entice investors, despite bringing greater risk.\n\nBonds that are non-investment grade are considered to be high-yield or \"junk\" bonds. They are considered to be high-risk and usually have ratings of \"BB+\" to \"D\" or not rated. Investors can profit through buying junk bonds, but they are also at greater risk of losing their investment, as these kinds of companies tend to have liquidity issues.\n\nAn investment grade bond is a so-called high-quality or low-risk bond. It is considered to be a fairly safe bet and has a very low rate of default. Bonds rated \"AAA,\" \"AA,\" \"A,\" and \"BBB\" are considered investment grade.\n\nA bond rating is a grading given to a bond that indicates its creditworthiness. Bond ratings are assigned by agencies, such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, and reflect an analysis of the bond issuer's financial strength or capacity to pay a bond's principal and interest.\n\nThe rating organizations assign grades to the bond, such as \"AAA,\" which indicates lower risk, or \"B-,\" which indicates greater risk. Higher-risk bonds offer higher yields, while lower-risk bonds offer lower yields.\n\nFitch Ratings. \"Fitch Downgrades the United States' Long-Term Ratings to 'AA+' from 'AAA'; Outlook Stable.'\n\nMoody's. \"Moody's Ratings Downgrades United States Ratings to Aa1 From Aaa; Changes Outlook to Stable.\"\n\nThe Council on Foreign Relations. \"The Credit Rating Controversy.\"",
