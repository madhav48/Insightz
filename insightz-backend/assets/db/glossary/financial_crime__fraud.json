He used his Wall Street connections and reputation to attract high-net-worth clients, whose investments he promised to manage. But instead of investing their money, he\u2019d put it in a bank account that generated nearly no return. When a client wanted to cash out, he simply withdrew their initial investment plus a respectable \u201creturn\u201d that was actually just a portion of another client\u2019s investment.
