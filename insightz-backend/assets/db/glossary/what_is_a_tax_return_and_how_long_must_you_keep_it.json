You should keep tax returns for at least three years.\n\nIn the United States, tax returns are filed with theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)and with the state or local\u00a0tax\u00a0collection agency. Individuals typically useForm 1040or Form 1040-SR to file federal income taxes. Corporations\u00a0will use Form 1120 and partnerships\u00a0will useForm 1065to file their annual returns.\n\nA variety of1099 formsare used to report income from non-employment-related sources. To apply for an automatic extension of time to file an individual income tax return, useForm 4868.\n\nConsider other needs for your tax returns before you discard old copies.

However, there are often credits attributed to the care of dependent children, individuals aged 65 or older, or those with permanent and total disability. Note that there may be income limitations or restrictions to these credits.\n\nAfter reporting income, deductions,and credits, the end of the return identifies the amount the taxpayer\u00a0owes in taxes or the amount of tax overpayment. Overpaid taxes may be\u00a0refunded\u00a0or rolled into the next tax year.\n\nTaxpayers may remit payment as a single sum or schedule tax payments periodically.\n\nMostself-employed individualsmust estimate their taxes and make payments every quarter.\n\nYou can file a tax return by filling it out yourself, using a tax software program, or hiring a tax preparer or accountant who will gather the required information from you and file it on your behalf.
