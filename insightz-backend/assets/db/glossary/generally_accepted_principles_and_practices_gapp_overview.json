  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP), which are also known as the Santiago principles, are standardized business procedures related to the operation ofsovereign wealth funds(SWFs), which have agreed to pursue financial rather than political agendas and maintain a stable global financial system.\n\nThe generally accepted principles and practices (GAPP), were agreed upon by the International Working Group of the Sovereign Wealth Funds (IWG)\u201423 countries with SWFs\u2014in October 2008. In response to the concern ofinvestorsand regulators about the inadequate transparency, independence, and governance of the industry, the IWG resolved that SWFs demonstrate that their arrangements are properly set up and investments are made on an economic and financial basis\u2014instead of pursuing political agendas.\n\nGAPP is underpinned by the following guiding objectives for SWFs, defined as \"special purpose investment funds or arrangements, owned by the general government\":\n\nThe 24 voluntary Santiago Principles simply provide a framework for these guiding principles in three key areas: legal, institutional, and investment and risk.The principles are maintained and promoted by theInternational Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds(IFSWF), whose members voluntarily endorse the principles and seek to implement them in their governance and investment practices. As of 2021, the forum represented more than 30 sovereign wealth funds from all corners of the globe.\n\nInternational Working Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds. \"Sovereign Wealth Funds: Generally Accepted Principles and Practices,\" Pages 4 and 27.
