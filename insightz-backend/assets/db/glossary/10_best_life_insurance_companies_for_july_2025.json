  "definition": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nShanker Narayan has over two years of experience conducting research across multiple industries.

He oversees the data collection, verification, and analysis processes for financial product reviews. Shanker holds a bachelor's in Applied Statistics from the University of Virginia.\n\nNationwide sweeps the titles in Investopedia\u2019s list of best life insurance companies, earning the top spot thanks to its great variety of products and features, rock-solid financial footing, and high customer satisfaction ratings. We also named Nationwide best in two other categories, but other insurers may still fit your needs better.\n\nLife insurance is an important product that protects your loved ones financially after you die. But it\u2019s complex, which is why Investopedia researched 70 criteria for 45 life insurance companies, including price, policy types and features, customer satisfaction, and much more before naming the best life insurers.\n\nCompare life insurance quoteswith our partner Covr Financial from multiple providers before buying.\n\nWith a broad range of product types and features, very satisfied customers, no coverage limits for many policy types, and a stellar grade fromcredit rating agency AM Best, Nationwide is at the top of our list of the best life insurance companies. Its threeliving benefitriders\u2014which come at no extra cost\u2014 also helped boost its overall score.\n\nNationwide is a great choice for anyone looking toinsure a child. Reason #1: You can buy as large of a whole life policy as you like for a child. Reason #2: The child can take over the policy when they\u2019re an adult. Reason #3: If you buy a child term rider on your own policy, the rider can cover them until they\u2019re 22 and be made into apermanent life insurance policyfor the child without a health exam.\n\nMany of the features that make Nationwide our favorite pick overall also propelled it to the top of our list of the best life insurance for people over 50. But it also scored well for this age group because you can buy up to $1.5 million in coverage without amedical examand get an instant decision. And there\u2019s no minimum age requirement for a final expense policy worth up to $50,000.\n\nOutstanding selection of product types\n\nSuperior financial strength rating (A+)\n\n3 living benefits included in many policies\n\nStand-out child life insurance features\n\nVery few customer complaints to state regulators\n\nDoesn\u2019t paydividends on whole life policies\n\nWon\u2019t sell term life to applicants over 70\n\nNo live chat for customer service\n\nNationwide rises above competitors on a multitude of fronts. It has one of the widest product selections Investopedia saw among the 45 companies we surveyed. Ditto that forriders\u2014only Ameritas and Brighthouse Financial offer as many. Nationwide\u2019s riders include three free living benefits that let youuse your death benefit while you\u2019re aliveif you develop a chronic, critical or terminal illness.\n\nCustomers generally like the company, lodging few complaints with state regulators and pushing it to No. 4 out of 22 companies in the 2024 J.D. Power U.S. Individual Life Insurance Study.\n\nThere are only a few things we found to not like. It doesn\u2019t pay dividends on its whole life policies, so if you want that, you\u2019d be better off looking for a mutual company such as Lafayette or MassMutual. And you can\u2019t buy a term life insurance policy from Nationwide if you\u2019re over 70.\n\nFounded in 1925, Nationwide is based in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nLow premiums and terms lasting up to 40 years helped propel Banner to the top of our list of bestterm life insuranceproviders. Many competitors don\u2019t offer term life insurance that covers you for that long. The minimum death benefit is $100,000, and there is no maximum, so these policies are good for people with a wide range of coverage needs. You canrenewa Banner term policy every year andconvert it to a permanent life insurance planwith no additional health exam. And applying is easy, with an online quote and application process.\n\nCompetitive premiums for term life insurance\n\nLengthy 40-year terms available\n\nNo-medical-exam policies have no coverage caps\n\nFewer permanent policy options than competitors\n\nMany people choose term life insurance because the premiums are more affordable than permanent life insurance. That\u2019s especially true of policies you get from Banner by Legal & General. Its premiums are some of the most competitive we found when gathering quotes for 45 life insurance providers. It\u2019s also the only company besides Protective Life that offers 40-year term policies, which means they could last your entire working life. Most companies limit you to 30 years at most for term coverage.\n\nLike Nationwide, Banner has a low incidence of consumer complaints and an impressive financial stability rating from AM Best.\n\nBut Banner\u2019s selection of other products is disappointing. Universal life is the only other type of life insurance it sells, though that won\u2019t matter much if you\u2019re set on buying term insurance. The other factor to consider is that you won\u2019t find many riders with which to customize your coverage.\n\nBanner is based in Frederick, Maryland, and owned by Legal & General, which has been in business since 1836.\n\nProtective\u2019s child term rider is the best we found, so it\u2019s possible to add superb protection for your children through your own life insurance policy.\n\nChild term rider offers long-lasting, transferable, and convertible coverage\n\nWhole life policies start at just $1,000 in coverage\n\n40-year term life policies available\n\nNo children\u2019s whole life policies are available\n\nAll applications require a medical exam\n\nWhole life policies don\u2019t pay dividends\n\nInvestopedia found Protective\u2019s child term rider distinctive because it covers your children until they turn 25, and it\u2019s transferable and convertible to a permanent policy such as whole life or universal life when they become adults.\n\nHowever, child coverage is limited to this rider. Protective Life does not sell a standalone child\u2019s whole life policy.\n\nBeyond child coverage, Protective has a fine selection of policies and riders for adults. These include term policies for as long as 40 years and whole life policies with death benefits ranging from $1,000 to as high as you can qualify for. There is no maximum coverage limit.\n\nProtective Life has been around since 1907 and has its headquarters in Birmingham, Alabama.\n\nSBLI not only has some of the lowest premiums for term life insurance, but it also has a strong record of customer satisfaction. On top of that, it lets you convert your term policy to permanent insurance without a medical exam, and that option is included for no extra cost.\n\nBudget-friendly term insurance premiums\n\nHelpful online features and tools\n\nDoesn\u2019t offer universal or variable universal life insurance\n\nWhole life dividend rate is low\n\nFor term life insurance at an affordable price, it\u2019s hard to beat SBLI. It provided some of the lowest premiums Investopedia found when gathering quotes from 45 companies. You can get an individualized quote for yourself, apply for a term policy, and chat with a live representative all through the\u00a0 website. Customers seem happy with SBLI, lodging relatively few complaints with state regulators compared to the company\u2019s size.\n\nThese qualities make SBLI great for cheap term insurance, but it\u2019s not the best for permanent life insurance. SBLI doesn\u2019t offer universal or variable universal life insurance and the dividend rate for its whole life insurance is low. Investopedia found the company\u2019s rider selection on the skimpy side too.\n\nSBLI\u2019s headquarters is in Woburn, Massachusetts and it was founded in 1907.\n\nPacific Life excels at universal life (UL) insurance, offering numerous policies across all the main types of UL (traditional universal, indexed universal, and variable universal). Death benefits can run as small as $25,000 and have virtually no top limit. You\u2019ll find a lot of riders to choose from, including a child term rider available for UL policies.\n\nOffers every main type of universal life insurance\n\nDeath benefits have no maximum limits\n\nCustomer complaints are few relative to company size\n\nNo online quotes or applications\n\nDoesn\u2019t offer whole life insurance\n\nPacific Life is one of the few companies that sells universal life, indexed universal (IUL), and variable universal life insurance (VUL). Nationwide, Prudential, and John Hancock do as well, but they don\u2019t offer as many different policy options for each type. In some markets, Pacific Life features two UL, four IUL, and five VUL products.\n\nBut these products are complex and Pacific Life doesn\u2019t let you apply online. You\u2019ll have to talk with an agent by phone or in person. And the company does not sell whole life insurance.\n\nBased in Newport Beach, California, Pacific Life was founded in 1868.\n\nLafayette Life outscored rivals in the whole life department thanks to its broad range of whole life policies and riders (many included at no cost), and its high coverage limits. You can buy as large of a policy as you want (provided you can qualify based on your income).\n\nOffers seven whole life insurance policies\n\nPolicies come with 3 free living benefit riders\n\nOther top competitors pay better dividend rates\n\nDoesn\u2019t offer universal or variable life insurance\n\nWith seven different whole life policies, Lafayette Life offers options to suit a variety of needs. There\u2019s no limit on how large the death benefit can be, and we like that Lafayette has a lot of free riders, including those that let you use your coverage while you\u2019re alive if you get a serious illness.\n\nOn the downside, Lafayette\u2019s dividend rate is lower than that of competitors such as MassMutual and Guardian Life. You\u2019ll also need to call the company or meet an agent in person to apply; there\u2019s no online application.\n\nFounded in 1905, Lafayette Life is headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nMassMutual pays the highest whole life dividend rate to policyholders of the companies Investopedia researched. That meanscash valuegrows faster than with whole life policies at competing insurers.\n\nWhole life policies have paid generous dividends\n\nPeople up to 90 years old can apply for whole life\n\nComplaints about the company are extremely rare, given its size\n\nYou can\u2019t get a quote or apply for a policy online\n\nAll policy applications require a medical exam\n\nMassMutual scored slightly lower than Lafayette for our best whole life insurance list, but it was a close call. MassMutual beats Lafayette on a couple of fronts. Its dividend rate is the highest of all insurers on this list at 6.10%, and it offers whole life policies to people up to age 90. Only Thrivent and Guardian Life have age limits that are that high.\n\nOn the downside, you have to talk to an agent and take a medical exam to buy a MassMutual policy, and there are no same-day decisions.\n\nMassMutual has called Springfield, Massachusetts, home since its founding in 1851.\n\nIf you want a substantial life insurance policy and don\u2019t want to take a medical exam when you apply, Penn Mutual is the best provider. Its no-medical-exam policies can run up to $10 million\u2014the highest amount we found in our research.\n\nLarge policies available without a medical exam\n\nHigh dividend rate for whole life policies\n\nGreat customer complaint record\n\nDoesn\u2019t offer final expense insurance\n\nNo online application or quotes\n\nNo live chat for customer service\n\nPenn Mutual\u2019s cap on no-medical-exam coverage is double that of the next-highest limit we saw ($5 million from Nationwide or Symetra) and many orders of magnitude higher than competitors whose caps run as low as $25,000.\n\nWhole life policyholders enjoy dividends, and at 5.75%, Penn Mutual\u2019s dividend interest rate is among the highest of the companies Investopedia researched. Dividends are never guaranteed, but the company has paid them for 175 straight years, with a record $200 million of dividends paid in 2024.\n\nCustomers made few complaints to state regulators about Penn Mutual, according to theNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Complaint Index.\n\nOur main issue with Penn Mutual is that if you\u2019re looking for a small no-examfinal expense policy, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere. Penn Mutual doesn\u2019t offer these types of policies. It also lacks online quotes and application features that many competitors have.\n\nSymetra has the second-highest coverage limit ($5 million) Investopedia dug up for life insurance policies you can apply for without taking a medical exam\u2014and you could get approved in a matter of minutes.\n\nNo-medical-exam policies come with high coverage limits\n\nLow rate of customer complaints relative to the company\u2019s size\n\nSymetra is another great choice for no-medical-exam insurance, along with Penn Mutual. Its coverage limit is half as big as Penn Mutual\u2019s but at $5 million, that\u2019s still ample for many people. You must still qualify based on age, income, and medical records. But you can apply online, and Symetra can make coverage decisions in minutes.\n\nBeyond no-exam term life insurance, Symetra\u2019s product lineup is patchy. The company doesn\u2019t sell whole life, final expense, or universal life insurance, though it does offer three indexed universal life policies and one variable universal policy. It has a few riders, but not nearly as many as a powerhouse like Nationwide.\n\nSymetra was founded in 1957 and is based in Bellevue, Wash.\n\nThrivent\u2019s A++ grade from credit rating agencyAM Bestis the highest possible, indicating what Best calls a \u201csuperior ability to meet ongoing insurance obligations.\u201dNote that Thrivent is a member-owned organization for Christians. To sign up, you\u2019ll need to sign a statement saying that you or your spouse is Christian. If you\u2019re applying for a minor, you\u2019ll need to assert that they\u2019re being raised in the Christian faith.\n\nThrivent\u2019s record for customer complaints to state regulators is nearly pristine. State regulators received far fewer complaints than expected for a company of its size over a three-year period, giving Thrivent the best record of all the life insurers Investopedia researched. (MassMutual came in a close second.)\n\nHighest available financial strength rating\n\nBest complaint score of any insurer Investopedia reviewed\n\nOffers a wide variety of policy types\n\nOnly available to applicants who declare themselves Christians\n\nFounded in 1902 and based in Minneapolis, Thrivent has the highest financial strength rating there is: A++. That means you can rest assured that the company will be able to pay its claims many years down the road. Thrivent\u2019s wide range of life insurance products includes term, whole life, and universal. And if you\u2019re like many of Thrivent\u2019s other customers, you\u2019ll find little to complain about once you get a policy.\n\nHowever, applying is less straightforward than with other competitors. There\u2019s no online application, so you\u2019ll have to pick up the phone and meet or speak with an agent to apply. And you\u2019ll need to be a Christian to buy a policy\u2014or at least attest that you are.\n\nWe\u2019re also not impressed with Thrivent\u2019s limited set of riders, especially the lack of a child term rider.\n\nInvestopedia product reviews are the result of rigorous, unbiased research and analysis by staff researchers and editors. We created this list of the best life insurance companies after collecting data points related to dozens of criteria from 45 companies. The criteria helped us evaluate each company\u2019s costs, coverage options, financial stability, and other features and come up with objective assessments to help you choose the best provider for you.\n\nInvestopedia has been a trustworthy source of financial information since 1999 and has been reviewing life insurance companies since 2020.\n\nAlife insurance policyis a contract between a policyholder and an insurer. The policyholder agrees to pay ongoing premiums and in exchange the insurer pays out a guaranteed death benefit if the policyholder dies.\n\nWith life insurance, policyholders designate who they want to receive thedeath benefit, known as thebeneficiaries. The death benefit is typically received tax-free.\n\nThepremiums\u2014or the cost you pay for a life insurance policy\u2014are influenced by many factors such as the type of insurance you purchase, your gender, age, health status, and medical history. Someone who is 30 years old with no pre-existing conditions will qualify for lower premiums compared to someone who\u2019s in their 60s, smokes, and has diabetes.\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why you might take out a life insurance policy. For example, some policyholders might want to leave behind a financial legacy while others may want to provide their family with an income replacement while they\u2019re gone.\n\nAdditionally, some life insurance policies offerliving benefit riders, which can pay out while you\u2019re still alive. For instance, some living benefit riders enable people to access all or a part of their death benefit if they\u2019re diagnosed with a chronic or terminal illness. Some of these riders are included automatically while others cost extra, depending on the insurer and type of benefit.\n\nFinally, some life insurance policies buildcash valuewhich you can access and spend while alive. These policies combine a savings account with life insurance protection.\n\nYou are not guaranteed to buy most types of life insurance. When someone applies for a policy, the insurer will complete a process known asunderwritingto assess the risk of an applicant. They\u2019ll then use the information to determine whether someone is eligible for a policy, the cost of premiums, and the amount of coverage.\n\nDuring the underwriting process, an insurer will require that you complete an application and undergo a medical exam where blood and urine samples are taken. They may also evaluate data like your prescription history, driving records, credit history, and more.\n\nHowever, there are some types of life insurance policies that don\u2019t require applicants to undergo the full underwriting process, but these policies may offer lower coverage amounts and charge higher premiums.\n\nThere are broadly two types of life insurance:term lifeandpermanent life. Term life insurance offers temporary coverage (and is typically much more affordable because of this) while permanent life provides lifetime coverage so long as you keep paying the premiums.\n\nTerm life insurance is a type of life insurance that offers policyholders coverage for a fixed period of time\u2014typically, between 10 and 30 years. If a policyholder dies while they\u2019re covered, their beneficiaries will receive the death benefit. But if an individual outlives their policy, allowing the policy to expire withoutrenewing it, their beneficiaries won\u2019t receive the death benefit.\n\nThese policies usually have fixed premiums during the term, and tend to be much more affordable than permanent life insurance policies. That\u2019s because most term life insurance policyholdersoutlive their coverage, so insurance companies take on less risk when insuring these policies. You and your beneficiaries are also much less likely to receive a payout from term life insurance.\n\nIf you want more flexibility with your term life insurance policy, you may consider opting for aconvertible term life insurance policy. These policies give people the option of converting their term life policies into permanent whole life policies without undergoing an additional medical exam.\n\nWhole life insuranceis a type of permanent life insurance that offers lifelong coverage. This means that as long as a policyholder keeps up with their premiums, their beneficiaries are guaranteed to receive a death benefit when they pass away. Whole life insurance is typically much more expensive than term life.\n\nLike other permanent life insurance policies, whole life insurance offers a savings feature known as cash value, which policyholders can borrow from, withdraw, and use to pay premiums. With whole life insurance policies, premiums are typically level, which means they\u2019re fixed during your lifetime while you have the policy.\n\nHere\u2019s how permanent life insurance works: When a policyholder pays a premium, a portion of it goes towards the \u2018cost-of-insurance\u2019, which includes administrative costs and the cost of the death benefit. Another portion of the premium is allocated towards cash value.\n\nTypically, whole life insurance policies offer a fixed rate on cash value, so the rate doesn\u2019t fluctuate with changes in the economy or the market. Some insurers will even pay dividends on cash value.Dividendsare profits from the insurer that are returned back to policyholders, but they may not be guaranteed.\n\nUniversal life insuranceis another type of permanent life insurance. It offers more flexibility than whole life insurance. Universal life insurance policyholders can typically adjust their death benefit and premiums.\n\nWith universal life insurance, policyholders can make lower or higher premium payments within a certain range. If a policyholder chooses to pay less than the minimum premium, their cash value will be used to cover the rest of the cost. Yet if a policyholder regularly makes only the minimum premium amount, they could be at risk of their coverage lapsing if they don\u2019t have enough cash value built up to cover their premiums.\n\nAdditionally, universal life insurance offers a variable rate on cash value, so the return may vary with changes in market conditions. However, there is still a minimum rate on cash value.\n\nIf you decide to terminate your universal life insurance policy, your remaining cash value will be returned back to you. There may be fees, known assurrender charges, and outstanding loans subtracted from that amount. The total amount you get back, sans surrender charges, is referred to as thecash surrender value.\n\nNote that surrender charges typically decline the longer you\u2019ve had the policy and may not be charged after you\u2019ve had the policy for at least 10 to 15 years.\n\nLike the name implies,no-medical-exam life insuranceapplicants are not required to complete a medical exam to qualify for a policy. This type of insurance allows applicants to simplify the application process, but these policies generally charge higher premiums and may offer lower coverage amounts because insurers may not have a complete picture of health.\u00a0There are three categories of no-medical exam life insurance: accelerated underwriting, simplified issue, and guaranteed issue.\n\nAccelerated underwriting:With accelerated underwriting, insurers may still require a health questionnaire, but they also evaluate data like an individual\u2019s prescription history, criminal records, and more. Some insurers may charge higher premiums for these policies, but some may not. Accelerated underwriting has tougher standards than other no-medical exam policies. In exchange, you can usually apply for much larger amounts of coverage, up to $1 million or more depending on the insurer.\n\nSimplified issue:Simplified issue life insurance also typically requires a medical questionnaire. Approval for these policies is fast, but companies may limit coverage to up to $100,000 maximum.These policies may be best for those with medical conditions, as you may be denied coverage or charged higher premiums on a traditional policy.\n\nGuaranteed issue:Lastly, withguaranteed issue life insurance, applicants don\u2019t have to complete a medical exam or a questionnaire. You are guaranteed to qualify, even with serious health issues. For this reason, guaranteed issue life insurance policies generally offer very limited coverage, ranging from a few thousands dollars to up to $50,000.\n\nThese policies also have a graded death benefit, which means there\u2019s a waiting period of two to three years. If a policyholder dies during the waiting period, their beneficiaries won\u2019t receive the death benefit, but they will get back any premiums plus interest. After the waiting period is over, beneficiaries receive the full death benefit. Guaranteed issue life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy, which means it can include cash value.\n\nInvestopedia\u2019s list of the best life insurance companies is based on comprehensive research of 45 companies.\n\nTo even be considered for this list, insurance companies had to first meet Investopedia\u2019s standards for online transparency, financial strength, and customer complaint ratings. Investopedia commissioned a consumer survey about life insurance, and consulted market share intelligence and other information about insurance company relevance and popularity to come up with a list of 45 companies to research further.\n\nWe gathered 3,150 data points related to 70 criteria between May 20 and July 3, 2024. The data came from company webpages, media representatives, rating agencies (AM Best, NAIC, and J.D. Power), and customer service calls.\n\nThen, staff editors and research analysts created a quantitative model that scores each company based on six major categories. We weighted the categories as follows:\n\nFor more information, read our fullmethodology explanation.\n\nJ.D.
