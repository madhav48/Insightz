  "term": "Going Public: What It Means, How It Works",
  "definition": "Going public is the process of selling shares that were formerly held privately and are now available to new investors for the first time, otherwise known as aninitial public offering (IPO).\n\nWhen a company \u201cgoes public,\u201d it is the first time the general public has the ability to buy shares. The process of going public presents unique challenges and is best accomplished with a knowledgeable and experienced team at the helm. An important member of said team is an experienced securities lawyer. However, every member of the team has important responsibilities in guiding the company through the IPO process.\n\nThe mandatory SEC S-1 filing does not necessarily include all previous financial information, which is why it is imperative to do additional research prior to investing in an IPO.\n\nGoing public starts with a proposal to the company's board of directors by the management of the company. The proposal includes details and discussion on the company's past performance, objectives, business plan, and financial projections. Management then recommends entrance into the public market. After careful consideration, the board of directors decides whether to move forward.\n\nUpon approval, management starts assembling the IPO team, which usually starts with a securities lawyer and an accounting firm.\n\nAfter approval, the company's financial statements for the preceding five years are carefully reviewed and, if necessary, restated to comply withGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Certain transactions that are okay for private companies, such as somesale-leasebackarrangements, are then eliminated and financial statements are adjusted accordingly. The accounting firm takes the lead in this review and adjustment step.\n\nNow the company selects an investment bank and issues aletter of intentto formalize the relationship and outline the investment bank's fees, offering size, price ranges, and other parameters.\n\nWith a signed letter of intent, the securities lawyers and accountants prepare theprospectus. A prospectus is written to present to investors as both a selling document and as a legal disclosure document. A prospectus requires:\n\nThe company's investment bank and accountants will examine the company's management, operations, financial condition, competitive position, performance, and business objectives and plan. They also review the company's labor force, suppliers, customers, and industry. Often, the results of the due diligence investigation will necessitate changes to the prospectus.\n\nApreliminary prospectusmust be presented to theSECand the relevant stock market regulators. State securities commissions may also be required to sign off. The SEC usually comments on the prospectus, normally in the form of requirements for additional disclosure or explanation.\n\nAfter the preliminary prospectus has been filed with the SEC, the investment bank should assemble a \"syndicate\" of other investment banks, which will attempt to sell portions of the offering to investors. Assembly of the syndicate often generates useful information that helps to narrow the share price range.\n\nCompany management and investment bankers often perform a series of meetings with potential investors and analysts. Thisroadshowis a formal presentation by management on the company's financial condition, operations, performance, markets, and products or services. The potential investors and analysts then ask questions about the company.\n\nThe prospectus must be revised in accordance with the comments of the SEC. When the SEC declares the registration effective, the company can \"go to print\" with the prospectus.\n\nThe day before registration becomes effective and sales begin, the offering is priced. The investment banker will recommend a price for the company's approval, taking into account company performance, pricing of competitive offerings, roadshow outcomes, and general market and industry conditions. The investment banker will also make recommendations on the size of the offering, in consideration of capital required, investor demand, and control over the corporation.\n\nAn experienced financial printer, which has sufficient printing capacity and is familiar with the SEC's regulations regarding the use of graphics, receives the final prospectus for expedited printing.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cRoadmap for an IPO: A Guide To Going Public,\u201d Page 42.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cRoadmap for an IPO: A Guide To Going Public,\u201d Page 16.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cForm S-1,\u201d Page 1.\n\nFinancial Accounting Foundation. \u201cGAAP and Private Companies.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cUpdated Investor Bulletin: Investing in an IPO.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cRegistration Under the Securities Act of 1933.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cFiling Review Process.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cForm S-1: Registration Statement Under the Securities Act of 1933,\u201d Page 2.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cInformation Available to Investment Company Shareholders.\u201d\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cRoadmap for an IPO: A Guide To Going Public,\u201d Page 14.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cRoadmap for an IPO: A Guide To Going Public,\u201d Page 14.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \u201cRoadmap for an IPO: A Guide To Going Public,\u201d Page 45.",
