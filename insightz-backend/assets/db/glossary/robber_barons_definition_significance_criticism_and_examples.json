This derogative term was primarily used during the era of the late 19th century often known as theGilded Age.\n\nThe term robber baron is also sometimes used to describe any\u00a0successful businessperson whose practices are considered unethical or unscrupulous. This behavior can include employee or environmental abuse,stock market manipulation, or deliberately restricting output to charge higher prices.\n\nThe first known uses of the phrase \u201crobber baron\u201d described feudal lords in medieval Europe who robbed travelers, often merchant ships along the Rhine River as they passed nearby. The term appeared in American newspapers in 1859. Its modern use stems from Matthew Josephson\u2019sThe Robber Barons.\n\nRobber barons were widely despised and considered rapaciousmonopolistsduring their lifetimes. However, later biographies and historical reviews about the Gilded Age\u2019s American robber barons cast a more complicated and favorable light.\n\nA chief complaint against the 19th-century capitalists was that they were monopolists. Fear over the robber barons and theirmonopolypractices increased public support for theSherman Antitrust Act of 1890.\n\nEconomic theory says a monopolist earns premium profits by restricting output and raising prices. This only occurs after the monopolist prices out or legally restricts any competitor firms in the industry. However, there is mixed historical evidence that natural monopolies formed before the Sherman Antitrust Act.\n\nMany so-called robber barons\u2014James J. Hill,Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, andJohn D. Rockefeller\u2014became wealthy entrepreneurs through product innovation and business efficiency. Of the goods and services they provided, supply grew, and prices fell rapidly, greatly boosting Americans\u2019 standards of living.\n\nAndrew Carnegie gave over $350 million to charity during his lifetime, including over $56 million to build 2,509 public libraries around the world.\n\nAmong common criticisms of the early robber barons included poor working conditions for employees, selfishness, and greed. Not only that, some robber barons\u2014including Robert Fulton, Edward K. Collins, and Leland Stanford\u2014earned their wealth through political entrepreneurship.\n\nMany wealthy railroad tycoons during the 1800s received privileged access and financing from the government viaextensive use of lobbyists. They received monopolistic special licenses, per-mile subsidies, huge land grants, and low-interest loans.\n\nWorking conditions in 19th century America were challenging, to say the least. While robber barons took advantage of their workers, they sometimes offered better working conditions than the norm of the day. Rockefeller and Ford, for example, paid higher-than-average wages, including bonuses for innovation or exceptional production. Managers often received long vacations at full pay.\n\nSometycoonsrank among the most notedphilanthropistsof all time. Rockefeller donated around 10% of every paycheck he ever earned.He gave almost $550 million to charity and championed biomedical research, public sanitation, medical training, and educational opportunities for disadvantaged minorities.\n\nRailroad tycoon James J. Hill publicized and provided free education about crop diversification, along with free seed grain, cattle, and wood to local communities. He would transport immigrants at reduced rates if they promised to farm near his railroads.\n\nThe original \"robber barons\" were feudal lords who robbed travelers and ships passing through their territory. During the 1800s, the term was applied to successful capitalists like Andrew Carnegie, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John Rockefeller, who used monopolistic business practices to corner entire industries and extract great wealth from workers and consumers.\n\nAlthough the term \"robber baron\" is somewhat antiquated, it is still sometimes used to compare modern entrepreneurs to the monopolistic practices of 19th century industrialists. Today, the term is most often used for tech moguls heading companies like Apple, Google, Meta, and Amazon\u2014not only for the enormous wealth they've accumulated, but also for their allegedly monopolistic business practices, and the accusations of exploiting their workers and consumers.\n\nLess than half of billionaires inherit wealth, with the remainder building their fortunes through shrewd investments or entrepreneurship.According to Forbes, the most common path to riches is through the finance and investments industry (15% of billionaires) with the tech sector providing another 12%.\n\n\"Robber barons\" was a derisive term for the 19th-century capitalists who built their fortunes using monopolistic and exploitative business practices. Today, the term is sometimes applied to moguls in the tech industry, who are accused of using similarly monopolistic practices to take control of their markets and gain greater market share.\n\nMatthew Josephson. \"The Robber Barons.\" Harcourt, 1934.\n\nColumbia University Libraries. \"Philanthropy of Andrew Carnegie.\"\n\nHistory. \"10 Things You May Not Know About John D.
