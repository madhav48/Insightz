  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nOpen mouth operations are speculative statements made\u00a0by theFederal Reserve System (FRS)to influenceinterest ratesand rising prices within an economy\u2014calledinflation.\u00a0Open mouth operations are the announcements by\u00a0the Fed, also known as thecentral bankwhen it informs exchanges where the\u00a0preferred interest rates should be and not the action of the sale or purchase of U.S.Treasury securities.\n\nThe potential use of open market operations by the central bank is to reach\u00a0target interest rates. Their announcement typically causes the market to react. Marketplace reactions tend to adjust interest rates without the need for\u00a0the central bank to take\u00a0action.\n\nOpen mouth operations broadcast where the Fed, or central bank, believes interest rates and inflation should be in the short-and medium-term. When an action is taken on a Fed statement, it is known asopen market operations(OMO). Open market operations (OMO) refer to the buying and selling of government securities in the open market to expand or contract the amount of money in the banking system.\n\nThere are several forms of open market operations (OMO), the most common of which is the sale of government or Treasury department securities. If marketplace response does not move interest rates and inflation as intended by the Fed, they may take steps themselves to enact the changes.\n\nBuying and selling government bonds allows the Fed to control the supply of reserve balances held by banks, which helps the Fed increase or decrease short-term interest rates as needed.\u00a0Purchases of Treasury securities inject money into the economy and stimulate growth while selling those same securities can cause the economy to contract.\n\nRegarded as a flexible tool, the Federal Reserve controls monetary policy in the U.S. as it\u00a0facilitates the OMO process to adjust and manipulate thefederal funds rate. The\u00a0federal funds rate\u00a0is the standard paid when\u00a0banks\u00a0borrow\u00a0funds from one another. The Fed funds rate is\u00a0one of the most important interest rates in the U.S. economy. It affects monetary and financial conditions,\u00a0critical aspects of the broad economy including employment, and\u00a0short-term interest rates for everything from homes to credit cards.\n\nDuring its meeting on March 15-16, 2022, theFederal Open Market Committee(FOMC) announced a hike in the fed funds rate to combat rising inflation. The target rate range was increased by .25% (or 25 basis points) for the first time since 2018. The target range went from 0%-to-.25% to .25%-to-.50%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System, or the central bank of the United States, regulates U.S. monetary and financial policy. It is composed of a central governmental agency in Washington, D.C., the Board of Governors and 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.\u00a0Reserve Banks are located in major cities throughout the United States.\n\nThe Federal Reserve'smonetary policyregulates banking institutions, monitors and protects the credit rights of consumers,maintains the stability of the financial system, and provides financial services to the U.S. government.\n\nMonetary policy decisions fall to theFederal Open Market Committee(FOMC).\u00a0The FOMC enacts its policy by setting the target federal funds rate. Communication of this rate is through open mouth operations. If necessary, the FOMC will then implement open market operations, discount rate, or reserve requirement strategies to move the current federal funds rate to target levels.\u00a0The federal funds rate affects most other interest rates in the United States, including the prime, home loan, and car loan rates.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Open Mouth Operations.\"\n\nFederal Reserve System. \"Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"About the Fed.\"",
