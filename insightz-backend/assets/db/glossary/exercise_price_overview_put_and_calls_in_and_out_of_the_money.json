  "term": "Exercise Price: Overview, Put and Calls, In and Out of The Money",
  "definition": "The exercise price is the price at which anunderlying\u00a0securitycan be purchased or sold when trading a call or putoption, respectively. It is also referred to as the\u00a0strike price and is known when an investor initiates the trade.\n\nAn option gets its value from the difference between the fixed exercise price and themarket priceof the underlying security.\n\n\"Exercise price\" is a term used inderivativestrading. A derivative is a financial instrument based on an underlying asset. Options are derivatives, while the stock, for example, refers to the underlying security.\n\nIn options trading, there are calls and puts and the exercise price can bein the money(ITM) orout of the money(OTM). A call option would be ITM if the exercise price is below the underlying security\u2019s price and OTM if the exercise price is above the underlying security\u2019s price. The converse would hold for a put option.\n\nAputgives investors the right, but not the obligation, to sell a stock in the future. Investors buy puts if they think the stock is going down or if they own the stock and want tohedgeagainst a possible price decline. They buy puts because it allows them to sell the stock at the strike price of the option,\u00a0even if the stock falls dramatically.\n\nAcall, meanwhile, gives investors the right, but not the obligation, to buy a stock in the future. Investors buy calls if they think the stock is going up in the future or if they sold the stockshortand want to hedge against a possible surge in price. Calls give them the right to buy at the strike price even if the stock price rallies aggressively.\n\nTypically, put option investors onlyexercisetheir right to sell their shares at the exercise price if the price of the underlying is below thestrike price. Likewise, call options are usually only exercised if the price of the underlying is trading above the strike price.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that Sam owns call options for Wells Fargo & Company with an exercise price of $45, and the underlying stock is trading at $50. This means the call options are trading ITM\u2014the exercise price is lower than the price at which the stock is currently trading\u2014by $5.\n\nThe call options give Sam the right to buy the stock at $45 even though it's trading at $50, allowing him to make $5 per share by exercising the option. Sam's profit would be $5 less thepremiumor cost he paid for the option.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Wells Fargo is trading at $50, and the strike price of Sam's call option is $55, that option is OTM. It would not be beneficial for Sam to exercise that option because there is no need to pay $55 (using the option) when he can currently buy the stock for $50.\n\nExample of the Exercise Price / Strike Price in Wells Fargo Options Table\n\nThe further OTM an option moves, the less valuable it gets. It only hasextrinsic\u00a0value, or value based on the possibility that the price of the underlyingcouldmove through the strike price. Meanwhile, the further ITM an option is, the more value it has, giving Sam a better price than what is available in the stock market\u2014or another underlying market.",
