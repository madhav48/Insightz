  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nAn economic profit is the difference between the revenue received from sales and theexplicit costsof producing its goods and services, as well as anyopportunity costs.\n\nOpportunity costs are a type ofimplicit costdetermined by management and will vary based on different scenarios and perspectives.\n\nEconomic profit is often analyzed in conjunction withaccounting profit. Accounting profit is the profit that a company shows on itsincome statement. It is also known as \"net income.\"\n\nAccounting profit measures actual money inflows versus money outflows and is part of the required financial reporting and transparency of a company.\n\nEconomic profit, on the other hand, is not recorded on a company\u2019s financial statements, nor is it required to be disclosed to regulators, investors, or financial institutions.\n\nEconomic profit can be used in a \"what if\" analysis. Companies and individuals may choose to consider economic profit when they are faced with choices involving production levels or other business alternatives. Economic profit can provide a proxy for foregone profit considerations.\n\nThe calculation for economic profit can vary by entity and scenario. In general, it can be captured as follows:\n\nIf you excluded the opportunity costs from this equation, you'd get simply the accounting profit. However, when you subtract the opportunity costs as well, the economic profit results. It can serve as a comparison to other options that could have been undertaken by a company, for better or worse.\n\nCompanies state their explicit costs on the income statement. The accounting profit on thebottom lineof the income statement is thenet incomeafter subtracting for direct, indirect, and capital costs.\n\nThecost of goods soldis the most basic explicit cost used in analyzing per-unit costs. Thus, in the equation above, a company could also break down its opportunity costs by units to arrive at a per-unit economic profit.\n\nIndividuals starting their own business might use economic profit as a proxy for their first year of business (since they have given up some prior opportunity). With large entities, business managers can potentially look more intricately at gross, operating, and net profit versus economic profit at different phases of the business operations.\n\nAccounting profit, or net income, is determined by subtracting all costs from revenue for a particular accounting period. Economic profit is determined by going a step further and subtracting opportunity costs, as well. The former represents an actual figure that's included on financial statements. The latter can be used by company management to determine how effective its business decisions were. It can also be used before actions are taken to decide on the best business strategy to put to work.\n\nHere's a quick reference chart that summarizes the differences between economic profit and accounting profit.\n\nOpportunity costs can be used for deeper analysis of business decisions, specifically when alternatives are available. Companies may look at opportunity costs when considering production levels for different types of products that they produce collectively but in varying quantities.\n\nOpportunity costs are somewhat arbitrary and are a type of implicit cost. They can vary depending on management\u2019s estimations and market circumstances. Generally, opportunity cost will be the accounting profit that could have been achieved by making an alternative choice.\n\nAn individual starts a business and incurs startup costs of $100,000. During the first year of operation, the business earns revenue of $120,000. This results in an accounting profit of $20,000. However, if the individual had stayed at her previous job, she would have made $45,000. In this example, the individual\u2019s economic profit is equal to:\n\nThis calculation only considers the first year of business. If after the first year, costs decrease to $10,000 then the economic profit outlook would improve for future years.If economic profit comes out to zero, the company is said to be in a state of \"normal profit.\"\n\nIn using economic profit in comparison to gross profit, a company may look at different types of scenarios. In this case, gross profit is the focus, and a company would subtract the opportunity cost per unit:\n\nIf a company generates $10 per unit from selling t-shirts with a $5 cost per unit, then its grossprofitper unit for t-shirts is $5. However, if it could have produced shorts with revenue of $10 and costs of $2 then there would be an opportunity cost of $8 as well:\n\nAll things being equal, the company could have earned $3 more per unit if they had produced shorts instead of t-shirts. Thus, the -$3 per unit is considered an economic loss.\n\nCompanies can use this type of analysis to decide on production levels. More complex scenario analysis of profits may also factor in indirect costs or other types of implicit costs, depending on the expenditures involved in doing business as well as different phases of a business cycle.\n\nEconomic profits are the theoretical profits that result when company management subtracts all expenses plus the costs of lost opportunities from revenue earned in a particular period of time.\n\nIt can be important because it can help a company's management understand potential flaws in its choices for business strategies or ventures, missed financial opportunities, and how efficiently it uses company resources.\n\nIt's the cost to an individual or company of not pursuing a particular business option. The cost isn't related to something they spend. It refers to money they forego.\n\nEconomic profit represents a company's revenue less its explicit costs as well as its opportunity costs. It's used for internal analysis. Accounting profit (net income) is a company's revenue less its direct, indirect, and capital costs. It's reported on financial statements and to the IRS.\n\nEconomic profit is important for the insight that it can give the management of a company about potential or past business opportunities. Accounting profit is an important measure of profitability and management capability for investors.",
