Value fund managers are skilled in identifying these market inefficiencies. In theory, once the market corrects these inefficiencies, the value investor will gain from an increase in the share price. Oftenvalue stocksare also associated with dividend payments since they are usually well-established companies with committed dividend distribution programs.\n\nAblend fund(or blended fund) is a type of equity\u00a0mutual fund\u00a0that includes a mix of bothvalueandgrowth stocks.
