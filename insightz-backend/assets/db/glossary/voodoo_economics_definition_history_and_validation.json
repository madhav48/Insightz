  "definition": "Voodoo economics is a derogatory phrase\u00a0first used during the 1980 presidential primaries by George H.W. Bush, then a candidate, to describe his opponent Ronald Reagan's proposals to reinvigorate the U.S. economy. Reagan won that election, and his economic policies came to be known as \"Reaganomics.\"\n\nReaganomics was a policy that combined steep tax cuts, thederegulationof domestic markets, lower government spending, and a tightening of the money supply.\n\nRonald Reagan, a Republican, was elected the 40th U.S. president after a prolonged period of economicstagflationthat began under Republican President Gerald Ford in 1976 and continued into the term of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat whose single term ended with his defeat by Reagan in the 1980 election. Reagan's vice president was George H. W. Bush.\n\nPresident Reagan was a proponent ofsupply-side economics, which favors reducing income and\u00a0capital gains tax\u00a0rates in order to encourage economic growth. He believed that the savings generated by companies from corporate tax cuts\u00a0wouldtrickle down. That is, the savings would be invested in ways that benefited smaller businesses, spurred innovation, created new jobs, and eventually benefited the population as a whole.\n\nHe also asserted that the newly-invigorated companies would eventually pay more taxes anyway, boosting the government's coffers as a healthier economy encouraged them to increase production.\n\nIn 1980, Bush Sr. famously described these economic policies as \"voodoo economics,\" arguing that supply-side reforms would not be enough to rejuvenate the economy and would greatly increase thenational debt.\n\nBush Sr. changed his stance after being elected vice president, first denying that he called Reagan's policy proposal voodoo economics and then claiming that he was \u201ckidding\u201d when footage was dug up showing him using the phrase.\n\nNevertheless, the phrase caught on with Reagan's critics.\n\nBush Sr. was criticized for characterizing the policies of his then-rival as voodoo economics. His comments were viewed as a spiteful attempt to discredit Reagan while running against him in the Republican primary.\n\nA core belief of supply-side economics is that motivating the rich invigorates spending and increases confidence and job security among the working population.\n\nIn the drooping economy of the late 1970s, it was argued that these forces would bring the economy out of thestagflationit had been mired in since 1973. Furthermore, it was believed less government spending and reduced oversight would give thefinancial industry, in particular,\u00a0a much-needed boost.\n\nThose expectations did not all take shape exactly as planned. During President Reagan's two terms in office, unemployment fell considerably, disposable income rose, andinflationwas brought under control.\n\nHowever, the expectation that decreased taxes on the wealthy and businesses would result in increased spending on goods, services, and salaries failed to materialize. Moreover, President Reagan\u2019s relaxed regulation contributed to thesavings and loan crisis.\n\nBy the early 1990s, the U.S. economy had fallen back into recession.\n\nPresident Reagan\u2019s policies contributed to a near doubling of the national debt, in part due to his commitment to cut taxes while increasing military spending.\n\nVoodoo economics has become a popular phrase used to dismiss any ambitious economic pledges made by a politician.\n\nAfter two terms as vice president, George H.W. Bush was elected president in 1989 and served for a single term.\n\nAs president, Bush prioritized broader fiscal responsibility overtax cuts. In 1990, he even agreed to a tax increase, reneging on a promise made just two years earlier. That embarrassing U-turn saw him face criticism from his own party. He went on to lose the 1992 presidential election to a Democrat, Bill Clinton.\n\nSupply-side economicsis a theory that maintains that increasing the supply of goods and services leads to economic growth. That is, businesses that aim to increase production need to spend money. They hire more people, expand factories, buy more raw materials, and find more outlets for their goods.\n\nGovernment officials who subscribe to this theory advocate tax cuts for corporations and wealthy individuals. They argue that this is a way to put more money in the hands of producers who will increase their spending to the benefit of consumers and workers.\n\nDemand-side economicscould be seen as the opposite of supply-side economics.\n\nDemand-side economics maintains that increasing the demand for goods and services is the key to economic growth.\n\nA demand-side economic policy might call for large-scale government spending on infrastructure projects in order to increase related production, purchases, and hiring.\n\nDemand-side economics may also be called Keynesian economics for John Maynard Keynes, who developed the theory and advocated its implementation as a way out of the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\nAs vice president, George H.W. Bush wisely did not make any reference to voodoo economics. He supported President Ronald Reagan's program of tax cuts on corporations and wealthy individuals.\n\nAs president, Bush might have been a more moderate proponent of voodoo economics. In 1990, he raised the maximum individual income tax rate to 31%, from 28%, two years after promising to do no such thing.That contributedto his failure to be reelected to a second term.\n\nVoodoo economics is a derogatory term for an economic policy that favors tax cuts for business and wealthy individuals as a way to spur economic growth that benefits all. Trickle-down economics is another derogatory term for it.\n\nIts more formal name is supply-side economics. This theory argues that increasing production of goods and services leads the way to economic growth.\n\nWDSU News. \"'A man of the highest character': Family, leaders, world reflect on former President H.W.
