  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe unit benefit formula is a method of calculating an employer's contribution to an employee'sdefined benefit planorpension planbased on years of service. Although a retirement plan that uses a unit benefit formula can reward employees for remaining at the company longer, it can also be more costly to implement for the employer.\n\nA unit benefit plan is an employer-sponsored pension plan that provides retirement benefits based on a dollar amount or, more typically, a percentage of the employee's earnings for each year of service. The unit benefit formula means the company pays a percentage of the employee's salary for each year of service.\n\nA unit benefit plan is usually based on a percentage ranging from 1.25 to 2.5%. When the employee retires, their years of service are multiplied by the percentage multiplied by the career average salary to determine the employee's annual retirement benefit.\n\nAn advantage of a retirement plan that uses a unit benefit formula is that employees are compensated for working longer at a company. However, the unit benefit method requires the services of anactuaryand, in turn, higher associated costs for the employer.\n\nA defined benefit plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where employee benefits are computed using a formula that considers several factors, such as length of employment and salary history. The company administersportfolio managementandinvestment riskfor the plan. There are also restrictions on when and by what method an employee can withdraw funds without penalties.\n\nDefined benefit plans, which include pension plans orqualified benefit plans, are termed defined because employees and employers know the formula for calculating retirement benefits ahead of time. This fund is different from other pension funds, where the payout amounts depend on investment returns.\n\nIf poor returns result in a funding shortfall, employers must tap into the company\u2019searningsto make up the difference. Because the employer is responsible for making investment decisions and managing the plan's investments, the employer assumes all the investment risk.\n\nA tax-qualified benefit plan has the same characteristics as a pension plan, but it also gives the employer and beneficiaries additional tax incentives not available under non-qualified plans.\n\nAqualified retirement planmeets the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section401a\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b, and so it's eligible toreceive certain tax benefits. Such a retirement plan is established by an employer for the benefit of the company\u2019s employees.\n\nQualified retirement plans give employers a tax break for the contributions they make for their employees. Qualified plans that allow employees to defer a portion of their salaries into the plan also reduce employees\u2019 present income-tax liability by reducing taxable income.Qualified retirement plans can help employers attract and retain employees.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service(IRS) has established annual contribution limits for employees enrolled in qualified plans such as401(k)s. For 2024, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $23,000. \u00a0If an employee is aged 50 or older, they can make an additionalcatch-up contributionof $7,500.\n\nThe IRS has also established annual limits for total contributions from both the employee and employer to a defined contribution retirement plan. \u00a0For 2024, the total annual contributions to an employee's account cannot exceed $69,000, or $76,500 including catch-up contributions.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"When Can a Retirement Plan Distribute Benefits?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(k) Plan Qualification Requirements.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(K) Limit Increases to $23,000 for 2024, IRA Limit Rises to $7,000.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"2024 Limitations Adjusted as Provided in Section 415(d), etc.\"",
