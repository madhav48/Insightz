  "term": "Investment Strategy: Ways to Invest and Factors to Consider",
  "definition": "The term investment strategy refers to a set of principles designed to help an individual investor achieve their financial and investment goals. This plan is what guides an investor's decisions based on goals,risk tolerance, and future needs for capital.They can vary from conservative (where they follow\u00a0a low-risk\u00a0strategy where the focus is on wealth protection) while others are highly aggressive (seeking rapid growth\u00a0by focusing oncapital appreciation).\n\nInvestors can use their strategies to formulate their ownportfoliosor do so through a financial professional. Strategies aren't static, which means they need to be reviewed periodically as circumstances change.\n\nInvestment strategies arestyles of investingthat help individuals meet their short- and long-term goals. Strategies depend on a variety of factors, including:\n\nThis, of course, isn't an exhaustive list, and may include other details about the individual. These factors help an investor determine the kind of investments they choose to purchase, including stocks, bonds,money market funds, real estate,asset allocation, and how much risk they can tolerate.\n\nInvestment strategies vary greatly. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach to investing, which means there isn't one particular plan that works for everyone. This also means that people need to reevaluate and realign their strategies as they get older in order to adapt their portfolios to their situation. Investors can choose fromvalue investingtogrowth investingand conservative to more risky approaches.\n\nAs mentioned above, people can choose to make their investment decisions on their own or by using a financial professional. More experienced investors are able to make decisions and investment choices on their own. Keep in mind that there is no right way to manage a portfolio, but investors should behave\u00a0rationally by\u00a0doing their own research using facts and data to back up decisions by attempting to\u00a0reduce risk and\u00a0maintain sufficientliquidity.\n\nBecause investment strategies depend so heavily on your personal situation and goals, it's important for you to do your research before you commit your capital to any investment.\n\nRiskis a huge component of an investment strategy. Some individuals have a high tolerance for risk while other investors arerisk-averse.Here are a few common risk-related rules:\n\nFor example,U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, andcertificates of deposit(CDs)\u00a0are considered safe because they are backed by the credit of the United States. However, these investments provide a\u00a0low return on investment. Once the cost of inflation and taxes have been included in the return on income equation, there may be little growth in the investment.\n\nAlong with risk, investors should also consider changing their investment strategies over time.For instance, a young investor saving for retirement may want to alter their investment strategy when they get older, shifting their choices from riskier investments to safer options.\n\nInvestment strategies range from conservative plans to highly aggressive ones. A review ofsome of the top investorswill show that there are a wide variety of strategies to consider. Conservative investment plans employ safe investments that come with low risks and provide stable returns. Highly aggressive ones are those that involve risky investments, such as stocks, options, andjunk bonds, with the goal of generating maximum returns.\n\nPeople who have a greater investment horizon tend to employ aggressive plans because they have a longer timeline, while those who want to preserve capital are more likely to take a conservative approach.\n\nMany investors buy low-cost, diversified\u00a0index funds,\u00a0usedollar-cost averaging, and\u00a0reinvestdividends.\u00a0Dollar-cost averaging\u00a0is an investment strategy where a fixed\u00a0dollar\u00a0amount of stocks or a particular investment are acquired on a regular schedule\u00a0regardless of the cost or share price. Some experienced investors, though, select individual stocks and\u00a0build\u00a0a portfolio based on individual firm\u00a0analysis with predictions on share price movements.\n\nSome investors may choose strategies such as value and growth investing. With value investing, an investor chooses stocks that look as they though trade for less than their intrinsic value. This means that these stocks that themarketis underestimating. Growth investing, on the other hand, involves investing capital in the stocks of junior companies that have the potential forearningsgrowth.\n\nA 25-year-old who starts off their career and begins saving forretirementmay consider riskier investments because they have more time to invest and are more tolerant to risk They can also afford to lose some money in the event that the market takes a dive because they still have time earn more money. This means they can invest in things like stocks and real estate.\n\nA 45-year-old, on the other hand, doesn't have a lot of time to put money away for retirement and would be better off with a conservative plan. They may consider investing in things likebonds, government securities, and other safe bets.\n\nMeanwhile, someone saving for a vacation or home won't have the same strategy as someone saving for retirement. They may be better off putting their money away in asavings accountor a CD for short-term goals like these.\n\nCatana Capital. \"11+ Investment Strategies \u2013 Which investment style is right for you to invest in the stock market?\" Accessed March 31, 2021.\n\nFidelity. \"Investment Strategy,\" Page 3.
