  "definition": "Financial statements are formal records that summarize a company's financial performance and position, providing a clear picture of its financial health.\n\nFinancial statements are reports businesses compile to record financial performance and health. They offer a clear, standardized picture to parties such as investors, creditors, and management, allowing them to assess operations and whether the business is headed in the right direction.\n\nFinancial statements organize important financial data so stakeholders, including board members, investors, shareholders, creditors, employees, customers, and analysts, can analyze the health of a company's finances. These statements must present complex data in a clear and accessible way for everyone, from CEOs to average consumers.\n\nAccountants prepare financial statements following specific accounting rules, like theGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)for U.S. companies or theInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)for many international companies. These accounting standards ensure that financial statements are clear, consistent, and comparable, so financial data presentation is as similar as possible.\n\nThere are four primary types of financial statements that provide valuable insights into a company's financial position and performance.\n\nA company's balance sheet provides stakeholders with a snapshot of its assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity at a specific point in time\u2014typically the last day of the reporting period. Rather than predicting future success or trends, the balance sheet reflects the company's current financial position.\n\nThe balance sheets follow the standard equation:Assets = Liabilities + Equity.\n\nYou must understand a few basic financial terms to read a balance sheet effectively.\n\nAssets represent what a company owns and are categorized as eithercurrent or non-current assets.\n\nCurrent AssetsCurrent assets, often considered short-term assets, can be converted into cash within the firm's fiscal year.\n\nNon-Current AssetsThese assets, also called long-term assets, are critical for a company's success but cannot be converted into cash within the firm's fiscal year.\n\nCurrent LiabilitiesTheliabilitiesdue within a year.\n\nNon-Current LiabilitiesOften calledlong-term liabilities, these are the company's financial obligations not due within a year.\n\nEquity, also called net assets, represents the company's assets minus its liabilities. Net assets are payable to shareholders.\n\nAn income statement overviews a company\u2019s revenues, expenses, net income, and earnings per share over a specified period, such as a quarter or a year. It answers the question: Did the company make money?\n\nIncome statementshelp stakeholders assess financial health and management success by comparing income statements across multiple periods.Key Components of Income Statements:\n\nThis statement has a few key components, but the formula for calculating shareholder equity varies from company to company.\n\nComprehensive incomeexpands equity exploration by including items not typically seen on a traditional income statement. It accounts for adjustments in securities held for sale by the firm, unrealized gains or losses on investments, hedging activities, foreign currency exchange rate changes, and adjustments to future pensions.\n\nSome companies produce a separate statement for comprehensive income, while others include it as a footnote on the income statement. While it is easy to overlook, comprehensive income gives a much fuller picture of the company's financial position.\n\nA company'scash flow statement (CFS)tracks the movement of cash into and out of the business over time. The primary purpose of the CFS is to show stakeholders where a company's money is coming from and how management is spending it. Cash flow statements are divided into three categories:\n\nThe cash flow statement shows where money went and if there is enough left or incoming to sustain future operations.\n\nThe Statement of Shareholders' Equity shows how a company's equity changes over a reporting period. It complements the balance sheet and helps assess whether the company's stock is profitable.\n\nAnother way to use the Statement of Shareholders' Equity is to assess how much money is left for shareholders after the company pays all liabilities and accounts for all assets. The leftover equity should accurately reflect the cost per share. A positive number signals stability, while a negative result may indicate looming financial trouble, possibly even bankruptcy.\n\nUntil the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), through the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, mandated that public companies have audits, financial statements were merely something some companies used to attract investors.However, after the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, mistrust grew due to manipulated financial data.\n\nAs the stock market and regulations evolved, independent auditors established standard reporting procedures to keep financial statements transparent and uniform. Today, several international and national standards boards regulate reporting structures to ensure that companies report accurate and transparent information.\n\nWhile financial statements are informative, they have limitations:\n\nTo read financial statements, you must understand key terms and the purpose of the four main reports: balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of shareholder equity.Balance sheets reveal what the company owns versus owes. Income statements show profitability over time. Cash flow statements track the flow of money in and out of the company. The statement of shareholder equity shows what profits or losses shareholders would have if the company liquidated today.\n\nThe core structure of financial statements is the same worldwide, but the accounting rules differ depending on which standard the company follows based on its locality or trading location. U.S. companies are required to use Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), while foreign companies may use International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nFinancial statements give a company's stakeholders, such as investors, board members, creditors, employees, and analysts, a picture of a company's financial performance and stability. They help stakeholders assess profitability and overall economic health to make decisions about investing in, lending to, or working with the company.\n\nFinancial statements are important tools for evaluating a company's financial health and future projections. There are four main types of financial statements: balance statements, income statements, cash flow statements, and statements of shareholders' equity, each with a specific purpose in detailing the company's financials.\n\nWhether you're an investor looking for new opportunities, a CEO seeking a quick snapshot of a company's finances, or someone curious about the inner financial workings of a company, knowing how to read and interpret these statements is a measure of financial literacy that will pay future dividends.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Statues and Regulations.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Beginners' Guide to Financial Statements.\"\n\nKPMG. \"IFRS Compared to US GAAP Handbook.\"",
