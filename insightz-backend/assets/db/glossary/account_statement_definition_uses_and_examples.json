  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn account statement is a periodic summary ofaccount activitywith a beginning date and an ending date. The most commonly known are checking account statements, usually provided monthly, and brokerage account statements, which are provided monthly or quarterly. Monthly credit card bills are also considered account statements.\n\nAccount statements refer to almost any official summary of an account, wherever the account is held. Insurance companies may provide account statements summarizing paid-incash values, for example. Statements can be generated for almost any type of accounts that represent ongoing transactions where funds are repeatedly exchanged. This can include online payment accounts such as PayPal, credit card accounts, brokerage accounts, and savings accounts.\n\nUtility companies, as well as telephone and subscription television service providers, usually generate account statements for their customers detailing their usage and any overages during the payment cycle. Such statements typically list debits paid, incoming funds or credits received by the account holder, and fees associated with maintaining the account. For example, certain types of savings accounts might incur regular maintenance\u00a0fees unless a certain minimum balance of funds is maintained in the account. Cable television subscriptions may include state taxes and other surcharges that are included in providing regular service.\n\nAccount statements don't necessarily need to be financial. Consider an account statement that tracks a company's environmental impact from one period to the next.\n\nThough account statements may vary based on the issuer and underlying service, you may come across the same elements across statements. These elements may include but aren't limited to:\n\nAccount statements should be scrutinized for accuracy, and historical statements are critical for budgeting. A credit or loan account statement, for example, may show not only the outstanding balance due but the interest rate charged on that debt and any fees that have been added during the payment cycle. This can include late charges for payments not received by their due date as well as overdraft fees when bank account holders overspend. Your account statements are a window into your finances.\n\nThe statement may also list financial information that relates to the account holder such as their credit score, or the estimated time it will take to completely pay off a debt via installment payments. Alerts and notices to the account holder may also appear on these statements, calling attention to matters with the account that need to be addressed, such unusual charges that should be reviewed and verified.\n\nAccount statements are often recurring and should arrive at a set cadence. Contact your account administrator to best understand when statement periods occur and when you may expect statements.\n\nAnomalous items on an account statement may be a sign the account has been compromised, perhaps through a stolen credit or debit card or throughidentity thieveswho gained access to account information. For example, an account holder or the financial institution might spot a charge for concert tickets or a luxury item that seems out of the ordinary.\n\nAccount holders may be able to dispute such out-of-place charges and file a claim that they did not make the purchase themselves. Reviewing your account statements as they come in is a good financial habit that can catch these red flags before they become a financial disaster.\n\nAccount statements may be delivered electronically or via paper. Electronic account statements are delivered digitally in formats like PDF, HTML, or throughonline portals. They offer convenience, reduce impacts to the environmental, and can often be easily stored.\n\nThe primary aim of electronic statements is to reduce paper usage, save space, and reduce the risk of unauthorized access compared to paper statements. Electronic statements may be password-protected and delivered through secure channels, reducing the risk of theft or interception. Electronic statements may also be more easily shared by other individuals needed copies\n\nPaper account statements are printed on paper and sent via postal mail to the account holder's physical address. Proper disposal of paper statements is crucial to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access to personal financial information.\n\nPaper statements do not require an internet connection or electronic device to access. This can be beneficial for individuals in areas with limited connectivity or those who prefer to review their financial information offline. In case of technical issues or loss of access to electronic records (both temporarily or permanently), individuals can rely on their paper statements as a secondary source of information.\n\nIf you notice an error or discrepancy on your account statement, contact your bank immediately. Provide them with the details of the incorrect transaction, and they will initiate an investigation to rectify the issue and ensure your account is accurate.\n\nThe recommended duration for keeping account statements varies, but it's generally advised to retain them for a minimum of one to three years. However, consult with a financial advisor if you're unsure what account information should be retained especially related to tax statements, investment statements, or banking statements.\n\nSome financial institutions may charge fees for providing paper account statements. Electronic statements are often offered as a free alternative or may have lower associated costs. Check with your bank for their specific fee structure and any incentives for switching to electronic statements.\n\nAccount statements can be used for budgeting and financial planning by analyzing income, expenses, and patterns of spending. Review your statements to track where your money goes, identify areas for potential savings, and make informed decisions about budget adjustments or financial goals.\n\nAccount statements provide a comprehensive overview of transactions, balances, and activities in a bank, financial, or other account. They include details such as deposits, withdrawals, interest earned, fees charged, and the current balance (if applicable). Account holders can access statements electronically or in paper format, and they play a crucial role in tracking finances, reconciling records, identifying errors, and aiding in budgeting and financial planning.",
