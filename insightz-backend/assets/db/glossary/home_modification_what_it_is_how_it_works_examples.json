  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nA home modification is any alteration made to a home to meet the needs of people who have different physical abilities, often to specifications outlined by theAmericans With Disabilities Act (ADA). These alternations are made so that disabled or differently-abled people can live independently and safely.\n\nExamples of home modifications include simple measures like removing throw rugs to prevent slips and falls to more permanent fixtures like installing wheelchair-accessible ramps or grab bars in the bathrooms for stability.\n\nA home modification can refer to a range of changes, alterations, and repairs that make a home more livable for individuals with different physical abilities. The price of home modifications can be as little as a few hundred dollars, although more extensive renovations can cost many thousands of dollars.\n\nFor larger projects, some financing options may be available. Some contractors even offer reduced rates and chargesliding-scale feesbased on a senior\u2019s income and ability to pay. The National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modifications is one of the best resources in the U.S.\u2014it offers training, education courses, and technical assistance.\n\nBecause of the breadth of the term, some people may think that home modifications include any type of home improvement or home renovation.\u00a0While in some cases, home modificationsmight also be considered a home improvementor renovation, home modifications specifically refer to alterations made to a home in order to make it more accessible for people with different physical abilities, including elderly people.\n\nThe ADA\u00a0established standards for accessible design for public accommodations that include creating automatic doorways, ramps, and elevators to accommodate wheelchairs. Water fountains must be made available at heights that individuals with disabilities can reach.\n\nMany homes may not be equipped to house individuals as they age. There are structural barriers that can impinge upon an older individual\u2019s independence, and make it so they are unable to go about their daily routines without assistance. Many older adults live in single-family homes that were built in a time when physical accessibility was not a consideration.\n\nEven now, there are few building requirements concerning physical accessibility in single-family homes.\u00a0The structural incompatibility can make it impossible for an individual to stay in their own home as they grow older, sometimes forcing them to move into a retirement home. If the individual decides to stay in their home, they may need to hire a caretaker, an ongoing expense many people cannot afford.\n\nHome modifications range in price and project scope. Some examples of home modifications include re-arranging furniture, widening external pathways, or installing any of the following:\n\nHere is the cost range of some common modifications, according toHomeAdvisor:\n\nThere are several ways to finance your home modification. One option is ahome improvement loan. Also, state and local agencies may be able to offer grants and loans with less-restrictive qualification requirements. If you are a veteran, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs offers several grants to help service members and veterans modify a home for qualifying service-related disabilities. Finally, you can opt for home modification loans and grants from nonprofit groups.\n\nThe Home Modification Loan Program (HMLP) was established by the Massachusetts Legislature in 1999. It provides no-interest loans to modify the homes of adults and children with disabilities.The loan limit is $50,000 for property owners and $30,000 for owners of manufactured or mobile homes.\n\nHome modification is the alteration of temporary and permanent features in the indoor or immediate outdoor environment of a home. They are intended to provide safety and independence for the elderly and people with disabilities. Home modifications range widely in project scope and price. There are different types of financial assistance to pay for home modifications, including loans, grants, and help from nonprofits.\n\nMid-Atlantic ADA Center. \"National Resource Center on Supportive Housing and Home Modifications.\"\n\nADA.gov. \"2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.\"\n\nMass.gov. \"Home Modification Loan Program (HMLP).\"",
