  "term": "Guide to Socially Responsible Investments (SRI)",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSocially responsible investing (SRI), also known as social investment, is aninvestmentthat is considered socially responsible due to the nature of the business the company conducts. A common theme for socially responsible investments is socially conscious investing. Socially responsible investments can be made into individual companies with good social value, or through a socially conscious mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nSocially responsible investments\u2014known asconscious capitalism\u2014include eschewing investments in companies that produce or sell addictive substances or activities (like alcohol, gambling, and tobacco) in favor of seeking out companies that are engaged in social justice, environmental sustainability, and alternative energy/clean technology efforts.\n\nIn recent history, socially conscious investing has been growing into a widely-followed practice, as there are dozens of new funds and pooledinvestment vehiclesavailable for retail investors. Mutual funds and ETFs provide an added advantage in that investors can gain exposure to multiple companies across many sectors with a single investment. However, investors should read carefully through fund prospectuses to determine the exact philosophies being employed by fund managers, along with the potential profitability of these investments.\n\nThere are two inherent goals of socially responsible investing: social impact and financial gain. The two do not necessarily have to go hand in hand; just because an investment touts itself as socially responsible doesn't mean that it will provide investors with a good return and the promise of a good return is far from an assurance that the nature of the company involved is socially conscious. An investor must stillassess the financial outlook of the investmentwhile trying to gauge its social value.\n\nDemand for ESG investments soared in 2020.Nearly 60% of respondents to an Investopedia and Treehugger survey indicated an increase in interest in ESG investments and 19% reported incorporating ESG standards into their portfolios.\n\nSocially responsible investments tend to mimic the political and social climate of the time. That is an important risk for investors to understand, because if an investment is based on a social value, then the investment may suffer if that social value falls out of favor among investors.\n\nFor this reason, socially responsible investing is often considered by investment professionals through the lens of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors for investing. This approach focuses on the company's management practices and whether they tend toward sustainability and community improvement.TheFTSE4Good Indextracks these companies and helps to identify companies with these core values. There is evidence that a focus on this approach can improve returns, whereas there is no evidence for investing success from investing purely on social values alone.\n\nFor example, in the 1960s, investors were mainly concerned with contributing to causes such as women's rights, civil rights, and the anti-war movement. Martin Luther King Jr. played a large role in raising awareness for the civil rights movement by targeting companies that opposed the cause as socially irresponsible.\n\nAs awareness has grown in recent years over global warming and climate change, socially responsible investing has trended toward companies thatpositively impact the environmentby reducing emissions or investing in sustainable or clean energy sources. Consequently, these investments avoid industries such as coal mining due to the negative environmental impact of their business practices.\n\nOne form of socially responsible investing involves promoting racial justice, equality, and inclusion. Known asracial justice investing, the purpose is to leverage both institutional and retail dollars to invest in ways that advance this and other anti-racist causes.\n\nOne example of socially responsible investing is community investing, which goes directly toward organizations that both have a track record ofsocial responsibilitythrough helping the community, and have been unable to garner funds from other sources such as banks and financial institutions. The funds allow these organizations to provide services to their communities, such as affordable housing and loans. The goal is to improve the quality of the community by reducing its dependency on government assistance such as welfare, which in turn has a positive impact on the community's economy.\n\nThey can be made into individual companies that havegood social valueor through a socially conscious mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nESG stands for environmental, social, and governance, which are important factors for some investors to adhere to. Those investors look for solid management of a company and seek out those that gear toward sustainability and community improvement. In 2020, the popularity of ESG investments took off.\n\nThey are VanEck Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF (FLTR), issued by VanEck; SPDR Bloomberg Investment Grade Floating Rate ETF (FLRN), issued by State Street; and iShares Floating Rate Bond ETF (FLOT), issued by BlackRock Financial Management.\n\nMoody's Investors Service, Inc. \"Research Announcement: Moody's - ESG Investing a Boon for Asset Managers as Product Skepticism Diminishes.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Funds \u2013 Investor Bulletin.\"\n\nMorningstar. \"Sustainable Index Funds Produce Strong Gains in 2021.\"",
