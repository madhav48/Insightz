  "term": "Investment Management: More Than Just Buying and Selling Stocks",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nInvestment management refers to the handling of an investment portfolio or a grouping of assets. It involves buying and selling assets, developing investment strategies, creating a tax strategy, and managing asset allocation. It can also include banking, budgeting, and other financial duties.\n\nThe term most often refers to the management of holdings in an investment portfolio and trading them to achieve a specific investment objective. Investment management is also known as money management, portfolio management, or wealth management.\n\nProfessional investment management aims to meet particular investment goals for the benefit of clients whose money they have the responsibility of overseeing. These clients may be individual investors orinstitutional investors, such as pension funds, retirement plans, governments, educational institutions, and insurance companies.\n\nInvestment management services include asset allocation,financial statement analysis, stock selection, monitoring of existing investments, and portfolio strategy and implementation. Investment management may also include financial planning and advising services, not only overseeing a client's portfolio but coordinating it with other assets and life goals.\n\nProfessional managers deal with a variety of differentsecuritiesand financial assets, including bonds, equities, commodities, and real estate. The manager may also manage real assets like precious metals, commodities, and artwork. Managers can help align investments to match retirement and estate planning as well as asset distribution.\n\nAccording to an annual study by research and advisory firm Willis Towers Watson, the 500 largest investment managers had a combined total of $128 trillion inassets under management (AUM)at the end of 2023. This represents an increase of 12.5% from the previous year, which saw a decline of $18 trillion in AUM.\n\nIncorporate finance, investment management\u00a0includes ensuring a company's tangible and intangible assets are maintained, accounted for, and well-utilized.\n\nRunning an investment management business involves many responsibilities. The firm must hire professional managers to deal with, market, settle, and prepare reports for clients. Other duties include conducting internal audits and researching individual assets\u2014or asset classes and industrial sectors.\n\nAside from hiring marketers\u00a0and training managers who direct the flow of investments, those who head investment management firms must ensure they move within legislative and regulatory constraints, examine internal systems and controls, account for cash flow,\u00a0and properly record transactions and fund valuations.\n\nGenerally, managers with at least $25 million in AUM or those who advise investment companies offering mutual funds must beregistered investment advisors (RIA).They must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) andstate securities administratorsand agree to accept thefiduciaryduty to their clients. This means they may face criminal liability if they don't act in their client's best interests. Those with less than $25 million in assets only register in their states.\n\nInvestment managers are usually compensated via amanagement fee, which is a percentage of the value of the portfolio held for a client. Also, fees are typically on a sliding scale\u2014the more assets a client has, the lower the fee they can negotiate. The average management fee is between 0.5% to 2%.\n\nThe revenues of investment management firms are directly linked to the market's behavior. This connection means the company's profits depend on market valuations. Major asset price declines can lead to a drop in the firm's revenue, especially if the reduction is great compared to the ongoing and steady company costs.\n\nClients may be impatient during hard times and bear markets, and even above-average fund performance may not be able to sustain a client's portfolio.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, the industry has also faced challenges from two other sources, both of which charge lower fees than human fund managers.\n\nAccording to some surveys, these lower-cost alternatives will often outperform actively managed funds\u2014either outright or in terms of overall return\u2014primarily due to them not having heavy fees dragging them down.\n\nThe pressure from the competition is why investment management firms must hire talented, intelligent professionals. Though some clients look at the performance of individual investment managers, others check out the overall performance of the firm. One key sign of an investment management company's ability is not just how much money their clients make in good times\u2014but how little they lose in the bad.\n\nAbility to time or outperform the market\n\nAbility to protect portfolios in down times\n\nProfits fluctuate with the market\n\nChallenges from passively managed vehicles and robo-advisors\n\nThe five leading asset management firms and the value of the assets they hold are:\n\nThese firms controlled 24% of total assets under management held by the top 500 firms.\n\nThe investment management industry is facing challenges, changing client expectations, and evolving technologies that will continue to be huge factors throughout 2025 and beyond.Big dataandartificial intelligence (AI)will also continue to be drivers of innovation in investment management, helping to increase the effectiveness of strategies likesmart beta. Here are some of the key findings from Deloitte\u2019s investment management outlook:\n\nInvestment managers typically design a portfolio with the client's interests in mind. This can include meeting with the clients to discuss their investment goals andrisk tolerance. Based on the client's feedback, the investment manager then buys the assets and securities to fill the client's portfolio.\n\nFrom then on, the manager will occasionally rebalance the portfolio as the market changes. The frequency depends on their agreement with the client\u2014in some cases, it may be assessed once a year, once a quarter, or even every month. The more actively a portfolio is being managed, the higher the management fees.\n\nInvestment managers may also provide advice to their clients in other areas, such as how to save for college or retirement.\n\nInvestment management is the professional management of various securities (such as stocks and bonds) to meet specified investment goals for the benefit of investors. Services can be provided by individual portfolio managers, investment management firms, or financial institutions.\n\nInvestment managers conduct in-depth research and analysis of financial instruments and market trends to make informed investment decisions. They develop and implement investment strategies, allocate assets, manage risk, and monitor the performance of their clients' portfolios. They also maintain ongoing communication with their clients to ensure that the investment objectives remain aligned with their financial goals and risk tolerance.\n\nQuantitative investmentrefers to investment strategies that rely on mathematical formulas to identify assets with high profit potential or low risk. Quantitative asset managers are likely to use computer modeling or statistical tools to identify potential investments that have been neglected by the wider market.\n\nWealth management and investment bankingare two common career paths in the financial sector. The main difference is their clients: wealth managers help individual clients invest their savings, while investment bankers serve corporate clients.\n\nInvestment managers charge a fee for their services. The exact fee structure depends on the manager and the client's needs: most will charge a small percentage of the client's assets, a share of the annual gains, or an annual fee. Some managers may accept a flat fee for a one-time consult.\n\nInvestment management fees can be structured in several ways, including a flat fee, a fixed percentage of assets under management,performance-basedfees, or a combination of these. A fixed percentage fee is charged based on the total value of the client's portfolio and is typically assessed annually or quarterly.\n\nPerformance-based fees are tied to the investment manager's ability to achieve specific performance targets, such as outperforming a benchmark index. In some cases, a hybrid fee structure combines both fixed and performance-based fees to align the interests of the investment manager and the client.\n\nInvestment management is a service that helps investors achieve their financial goals and objectives through the professional management of their securities and assets. By employing investment strategies, conducting thorough research, and consistently monitoring market trends and portfolio performance, investment managers enable clients to optimize their investments and navigate the complexities of the financial markets\n\nAs fees and investment approaches vary, investors should carefully evaluate their options and choose an investment manager whose expertise, strategies, and fee structures align with their unique financial goals and risk tolerance. Ultimately, a well-managed investment portfolio can significantly enhance an investor's long-term financial security and wealth.\n\nWillis Towers Watson. \"World\u2019s Largest Investment Managers See Assets Hit $128 Trillion in Return to Growth.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). \"Investment Advisers.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Division of Investment Management: Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Mid-Sized Advisers.\"\n\nDeloitte. \"2025 Investment Management Outlook.\"",
