  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nJoint-owned property is any property that's held in the name of two or more parties. They can be business partners or any other combination of people who have a reason to own property together. The matrimonial status of joint ownership of assets occurs when the two parties are spouses.\n\nJoint-owned property can be held in several legal forms, including joint tenancy, tenancy by the entirety,community property, or in trust.\n\nA joint-owned property can be held as ajoint tenancy. Two or more people have equal rights and obligations to the property they own together in this legal arrangement until one partner passes away.\n\nThe deceased owner's interest passes to the survivors without probate at this time. It's often referred to as a joint tenancy with rights of survivorship for this reason.\n\nTenancy by the entiretyis another joint-owned property option that's reserved solely for spouses. Each spouse has an equal and undivided interest in the property. The full title of the property automatically passes to the surviving spouse if one spouse dies.\n\nTwo additional forms of jointly owned property also have distinct features: community property and trust property. A spouse can acquire community property during a marriage. This property legally belongs to both partners.\n\nU.S. states with community property laws include Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin as of 2024. Five other states allow partners to opt into community property provisions: Alaska, South Dakota, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Florida.\n\nEach spouse can claim half the total income, if any, that's earned from community property.\n\nIndividuals can also create a joint option in a living trust. Both would be grantors and trustees. They can place individually- or jointly-owned assets into these trusts. Either of them can dissolve the trust during their lifetime provided that it's not irrevocable.\n\nChoosing the best form of ownership for joint property can simplify things if one of the owners passes away. Joint tenancy is commonly used to avoid probate, which can be a lengthy, costly, and public process of distributing a deceased person's assets in court.\n\nJoint- or jointly-owned property doesn't come without its risks. Individuals often desire to add others' names to the title of their property as a means of estate planning without attorney fees and this can bring added risks of embezzlement.\n\nAn elderly individual who's in cognitive decline might succumb to adding a friend or relation to a joint bank account. This individual would then have full withdrawal rights. This action is typically final and can't be undone after an individual adds another\u2019s name to the title of a piece of property, Certain exceptions that can be pursued through the courts, however, such as in circumstances of fraud or financial exploitation of those deemed to be legally incompetent.\n\nYes, it generally does if it's acquired during the marriage. Premarital property or anything owned solely by one spouse before marriage doesn't become community property just because a marriage occurs unless some action is taken to make that happen.\n\nInheritances made to one spouse alone are typically considered to be individual, non-community property as well, even if they occur during the marriage. The exact rules can vary a little by state law, however.\n\nAtenancy in commonis also a form of joint ownership but it doesn't carry rights of survivorship. Each owner retains the right to leave their share of the property to someone other than their co-owner in the event of their death. Shares of the property can be unequal as well. Party A might own 75% and Party B holds just 25%.\n\nThe grantor or creator of an irrevocable trust can't change its terms or undo it after it's been established and funded with money and assets. This includes adding or deleting beneficiaries or taking back property that's been placed into the trust.\n\nIrrevocable trustscome with some advantages, however. The grantor is surrendering ownership when they place assets into the trust so they're immune from estate taxes and creditor claims, unlike revocable trusts.\n\nJoint-owned property is any to which title belongs to two or more people or entities. Both have ownership rights but this can create legal implications that can be difficult to manage under some circumstances.\n\nAlways consult with a legal professional before you enter into an ownership situation with another party, even if they\u2019re a family member. Dissolving the arrangement if you change your mind can be complicated and financially prohibitive.\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Joint Tenancy.\"\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Tenancy by the Entirety.\"\n\nWorld Population Review. \"Community Property States 2024.\"\n\nLouisiana Department of Justice. \"Louisiana's Community Property Law.\" Page 2.\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Tenancy in Common.\"\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Irrevocable Trust.\"",
