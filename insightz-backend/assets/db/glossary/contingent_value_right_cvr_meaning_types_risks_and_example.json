  "definition": "The term contingent value right (CVR) refers to a right often granted to shareholders of a company facingrestructuringor abuyout. These rights ensure that the shareholders get certain benefits if a specific event occurs, usually within a specified time frame.\n\nThese rights are\u00a0similar to\u00a0options because\u00a0they frequently have an expiration date,\u00a0beyond which the rights to the additional benefits will not apply. CVRs are usually related to the performance of a company's stock.\n\nA contingent value right is tied to a theorized future event, such as an acquisition. CVRs are created when the two companies in anacquisitioncome to different conclusions about the value of thetarget. The acquirer may feel that the current value of the target is limited with the potential for a higher value. The target, on the other hand, may value itself higher for any number of reasons, including a new product or technology.\n\nCVRs help bridge the gap between this difference invaluation. An acquiring company can pay less upfront for the acquired company, but if the acquired company hits certain performance targets in the future, its shareholders will receive additional benefits.\n\nShareholders who are given a CVR are granted the benefit only if the triggering event takes place in the given time frame. If not, the CVR becomes worthless and expires.\n\nThese benefits give shareholders additional shares of the acquiring company or they may provide a cash payment. This is often linked if the acquired company's share price drops below a certain price by a predetermined date.\n\nCVRs come with some risks. That's because their real value is not discernible when they are issued. The risk shareholders face remains unknown because these rights are based entirely on the anticipated price of the stock or some unforeseeable occurrence. When CVRs are issued, a portion of the acquirer's risk is transferred to the target company's shareholders. This could have an adverse effect on any existing shareholders, depending on the price paid to acquire the company.\n\nThere are two ways that a contingent value right may be offered. They may be traded on a stock exchange or may be non-transferable.\n\nCVRs that trade on a stock exchange can be bought by anyone, which means they do not have to be current shareholders of the acquired company. An investor can buy a CVR on an exchange up until it expires.\n\nNon-transferable CVRs, on the other hand, apply only to current shareholders of the acquired company and are distributed at the time of themerger. Companies prefer non-transferable CVRs as transferable CVRs listed on an exchange require regulatory work and incur higher costs.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Listed Company Manual refers to CVRs\u00a0as \"unsecured obligations of the issuer.\" An unsecured obligation, also known asunsecured debt, carries no collateral or backing by an underlying asset. Shareholders do not have a guaranteed right\u00a0that the reward will be granted\u00a0to them.\n\nWhile they hold an obligation from a company, investors who receive CVRs are more akin to options holders than to, say, bondholders. Unlike the latter, they have no guarantee to be paid and they have no claim on the company's assets should their payment not materialize.\n\nJust like options, all CVRs\u00a0have an expiration date. No additional benefit is paid to the shareholder other than the stock itself if the CVR expires.\n\nIn Feb. 2023, the pharmaceutical company, AstraZeneca, purchased the pharmaceutical company, CinCor. As part of the deal, shareholders of CinCor received non-tradeable contingent value rights, which are payable when the regulatory submission of a baxdrostat product is submitted by a specified time. The value of the CVRs is $1.8 billion.\n\nCVRs are issued at the time that one company acquires another. It represents the difference in the two companies' valuation of the target and provides a benefit to its shareholders. These investors receive the benefit when the acquired company achieves a certain performance achievement.\n\nContingent value rights are not guaranteed. The acquired company must meet certain performance metrics and/or targets for shareholders to receive the benefit. If the CVR expires before this happens, no benefit is granted.\n\nTo profit from a CVR, investors must hold stock in the acquired company before it is delisted from the stock exchange. Companies tend to prefer non-transferable CVRs because it doesn't require listing the shares on an exchange. This costs less money and regulatory hurdles.\n\nIn an acquisition, the goal of CVRs is to bridge the gap between what the acquirer values the company at and what the company being acquired values itself at. As the acquirer believes the value is limited with upside potential in the future, it will provide shareholders with CVRs, which will provide a monetary benefit to shareholders if certain value potentials are reached.\n\nNYSE. \"703.18 Contingent Value Rights,\" Page 1.\n\nAstraZeneca. \"Acquisition of CinCor Pharma Complete.\"",
