He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nQuality of Life is a highly subjective measure of happiness that is an important component of many financial decisions.\n\nMany people think of quality of life as a very subjective assessment. But it is also an essential component of manyfinancial decisionssuch as the job you take and the place you live. The factors that play a role in measuring a person's quality of life vary according to personal preferences but often include financial security as well as job satisfaction, family life, social connections, health, and safety.\n\nFinancial decisions often involve a tradeoff in which the present quality of life is decreased to save money or earn more money for the future.\n\nQuality of life is strongly associated with financial factors beyond the basic necessities of food and shelter. More money often means access to greater comfort, freedom from many anxieties, and an optimistic outlook for the future.\n\nInevitably, job satisfaction is a key component of quality of life. For many of us, it determines our degree of satisfaction with half of our waking hours. Add in the importance of a paycheck and it affects many other aspects of our lives.\n\nIf a job provides time to enjoy life but leaves the worker too tired, injured, stressed out, or otherwise unable to enjoy their earnings, it subtracts from quality of life. Today, it is common to weigh both salary and quality of life when considering how good or bad a job is.\n\nQuality of life is also an issue when developing a personalsavingsplan. In this case, the tradeoff involves sacrificing current quality of life to improve future quality of life. This may include postponing luxuries and leisure activities that improve our overall sense of well-being.\n\nQuality of life can be measured in many different ways. Numbeo's Quality of Life index focuses on the following eight factors.\n\nPurchasing powerdetermines how much goods and services a population can buy with a given unit of currency. Ideally, the more goods and services that can be bought, the better.\n\nSafety is measured in a variety of ways, such as crime levels, the ability to walk alone at night, and digital, infrastructure, and personal safety. It can include crime statistics, well-being indicators, safe spaces, and community power.\n\nHealthcareevaluates the quality of a nation's healthcare system. It considers factors such as healthcare professionals, equipment, staff, doctors, costs, infrastructure, services, and accessibility.\n\nCost of livingevaluates how much it costs to live in a specific place. It assesses the relative prices of consumer goods, such as groceries, housing (rent or mortgage), entertainment, transportation, utilities, and restaurants.\n\nThis metric seeks to determine the affordability of housing. It evaluates the property prices of an area to the income of the population. If property prices are too high compared to income, it makes housing less affordable, reducing the quality of life.\n\nA shortcommuteto work is a good quality of life. It is often possible to save money on housing by living farther away from work but the trade-off is less time to spend with family or hobbies and more time sitting in traffic or waiting for a train. A healthy, short commute to work improves one's quality of life.\n\nPollution indexes evaluate the overall pollution levels in a certain place. Factors taken into consideration include air and water pollution, garbage disposal, cleanliness, noise and light pollution, green spaces, and comfort in relation to pollution.\n\nA good climate with moderate temperatures and low humidity is seen as improving the quality of life. An absence of dangerous weather events, such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornadoes is also considered in climate metrics when evaluating quality of life.\n\nQuality of life depends on the individual, but access to good healthcare, clean and safe housing, healthy food, and a living wage are near-universal factors.\n\nThese are the top seven countries with the best quality of life as ranked by Numbeo's Quality of Life Index as of mid-2024.\n\nLuxembourg is a small country in Western Europe with a population of 671,254.

While everyone's idea of a high-quality life varies, there are some universal markers.\n\nThese markers may include access to good healthcare, loving relationships, meaningful work or volunteerism, leisure time for hobbies you enjoy, good rest, healthy food, and the ability to perform an enjoyable form of exercise.\n\nStudies have found that practicing gratitude and meditation can improve your quality of life. Experts recommend adequate sleep (at least seven hours per night) to improve the quality of life and better control mood and energy levels.\n\nGovernments can look to data collected fromhappiness economicstudies and indices to find places to improve the population's quality of life. One such index is theGross National Happiness(GNH) index.\n\nThe latest version of the index, based on a survey of 5,000 Americans, concludes that Delaware residents have the highest life satisfaction, while Oregon residents are in last place.\n\nThere are many ways that a government can improve the quality of its citizens' lives. Actions include funding good public schools, offering affordable access to healthcare, and supporting family-friendly policies like paid leave to take care of sick family members or newborn or adopted children. These policy movements help families thrive.\n\nMany of the governments in countries listed as having a high quality of life provide services and programs to their citizens to help them improve their lives. These include access to living-wage jobs, affordable or free higher education, better gun control laws, and access to high-quality and affordable healthcare.\n\nThe quality of life in the U.S. is lower than in many developed nations due to declines in personal safety, high healthcare costs, and uneven access to high-quality public education.\n\nSome primary indicators of quality of life include sufficient income, job satisfaction, decent housing, access to high-quality education, a reasonable life-work balance, rewarding personal relationships, and access to cultural and leisure activities.\n\nWork on improving your work-life balance, relationships, home, and health.\n\nGovernments can improve the quality of life in their countries by offering affordable and accessible healthcare, investing in education, providing affordable housing, offering family-friendly policies, and putting laws into place for workers to earn living wages.\n\nQuality of life can be calculated in many ways. One is from the World Health Organization: \u00a0\"WHO defines Quality of Life as an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards, and concerns.\"\n\nThe United Nations University World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU WIDER) provides four qualities of life:\n\nQuality of life is, above all, an individual calculation. Most of us, however, include good health, good friends, loving relationships, and some degree of creature comforts in the factors they assess. It may sound distasteful, but the money we have and the ways we get it have a big role in many of the factors that make up quality of life.\n\nNumbeo. \"Quality of Life Index.\"\n\nNumbeo. \"About Healthcare Indexes.\"\n\nNumbeo. \"Understanding Our Cost of Living Indices.\"\n\nNumbeo. \"About Pollution Indices.\"\n\nWorld Bank Group. \"GDP Per Capita (current US$).\"\n\nCIA World Factbook. \"Luxembourg.\"\n\nCIA World Factbook. \"Netherlands.\"\n\nCIA World Factbook. \"Switzerland.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Meditation: In Depth.\"\n\nHarvard Health Publishing. \"Giving Thanks Can Make You Happier.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services. \"Get Enough Sleep.\"\n\nGross National Happiness USA. \"US Happiness Report.\"\n\nU.S. News and World Report. \"Best Countries to Live in the World.\"\n\nWorld Population Review. \"Standard of Living by Country/Quality of Life by Country 2024.\"\n\nWorld Health Organization. \"WHOQOL: Measuring Quality of Life.\"\n\nUNU Wider. \"The Four Qualities of Life.\"",
