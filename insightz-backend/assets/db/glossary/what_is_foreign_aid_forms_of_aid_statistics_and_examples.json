  "definition": "The term foreign aid refers to any type of assistance that one country voluntarily transfers to another, which can take the form of a gift,grant, or loan. Most people tend to think of foreign aid ascapital, but it can also be food, supplies, and services such as humanitarian aid and military assistance.\n\nBroader definitions of aid include any assistance transferred\u00a0across borders by religious organizations,non-governmental organizations(NGOs), and foundations. U.S. foreign aid usually refers to military and economic assistance provided by the federal government provides\u00a0to other countries.\n\nForeign aid is any type of assistance that one country's government provides to another nation, usually from developed to developing nations. Governments may issue aid in the following forms:\n\nGovernments may make agreements with the countries to which they provide assistance. For instance, a developed nation may agree to provide grants to those in need after anatural disasteror during times of conflict, whether they provide any type of capital or humanitarian aid. Alternatively, a government may agree to issue loans to an allied nation that experiences economic uncertainty with specialrepaymentprovisions.\n\nConcerned about where foreign aid goes? Only a small portion of American assistance goes to federal governments, while the rest is assigned to non-profits, NGOs, and other organizations.\n\nAccording to theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development(OECD)\u2014an intergovernmental organisation with 38 member countries aimed at promoting sustainable economic growth\u2014member countries contributed a record $223.7 billion\u00a0in international aid in 2023.\n\nThe United States is the most generous, according to the OECD, providing $66.04 billion\u00a0in foreign aid in 2023.The remaining countries that were among the top five donors included:\n\nTheUnited Nations(UN) calls for economically advanced countries to spend at least 0.7% of theirgross national income(GNI) on international aid. Norway, Luxembourg, Sweden, Germany, and Denmark are the only countries that met or exceeded this level. The total contribution of member countries, though, averaged 0.37%\u2014much lower than the UN target.\n\nThe countries that received the most foreign aid from the U.S. for 2023 include Ukraine, Israel, Ethiopia, Jordan, and Egypt.\n\nForeign aid estimates tend to vary, given the different agencies, funding methods,\u00a0and aid categories associated with U.S. foreign assistance efforts. For instance, the\u00a0Congressional Research Service (CRS)\u2014a nonpartisan arm of Congress\u2014the country spent $69.01 billion\u00a0in foreign assistance during the 2023 fiscal year. That figure amounted to 1% to 1.5% of the total federal budget authority.\n\nAid can be provided by governments directly or through special federal agencies. For instance, theUnited States Agency for International Development(USAID)\u00a0was\u00a0created in 1961 to provide civilian aid. It provides assistance with education, environment, climate change, global health, crises and conflicts, food and agriculture, water, and human rights.\n\nForeign aid\u2014also commonly referred to as international aid and economic aid\u2014isn't a new concept. The colonies were recipients of foreign military aid, particularly\u00a0from France, during theAmerican Revolution. During World War I, the U.S. government loaned the Committee for Relief in Belgium $387 million, much of which it later forgave.\n\nU.S. foreign aid began in earnest during World War II. Before entering the war, the government began funneling funds and materials to the allied nations under the Lend-Lease program, which totaled $50.1 billion by August 1945. The United States\u00a0also contributed $2.7 billion through the\u00a0United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), beginning in late 1943.\n\nFor the four years following 1948, the U.S. gave $13 billion in aid to countries affected by the war such as the United Kingdom, France, and West Germany\u00a0through theMarshall Plan. The Mutual Security Act of 1951 authorized around $7.5 billion in foreign aid per year until 1961.\u00a0The amount of aid authorized by the Mutual Security Act in 1951 was approximately 2.2% of the country'sgross domestic product(GDP).\n\nAs mentioned above, the United States was the world's top donors of government aid in 2023. However, as a percentage of national income, Norway was the highest donor, contributing 1.09% of its GNI to foreign aid in 2023.\n\nPer the OECD, foreign can take two primary forms. Bilateral aid is financial support that flows from one government to another. Multilateral aid is more complex, and it involves contributions from multiple government sources to multilateral organizations, such as agencies of the United Nations, which then use the funding to develop aid programming and projects.\n\nForeign aid can sometimes be a controversial topic, and has drawn opposition from a range of critics. Proponents of foreign aid argue that it helps nations develop, and that it can pursue humanitarian ends, such as relieving poverty or improving public health. However, some have raised issues related to the disbursement of foreign aid, arguing that it can be costly for donor nations, that it's difficult to oversee, and that it risks fostering dependence over agency.\n\nForeign aid refers to any resource that one country transfers to another. Aid can take the form of money, military assistance, or humanitarian resources, such as food, medicine, and shelter. Foreign aid can be distributed directly from one government to another, or it may be multilateral, channeled through organizations such as the United Nations.\n\nOECD. \"Official Development Assistance (ODA): International Aid Rises in 2023 with Increased Support to Ukraine and Humanitarian Needs.\"\n\nConcern Worldwide U.S. \"Foreign Aid by Country.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Foreign Assistance: An Introduction to U.S. Programs and Policy.\"\n\nUSAID. \"What We Do.\" Accessed Nov. 2, 2020.\n\nOECD. \"Frequently Asked Questions: Official Development Assistance.\"\n\nDevelopment Aid. \"Pros and Cons of Humanitarian Aid.\"",
