  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nRipple is a blockchain-based digital payment company that has created a network and protocol that uses thecryptocurrencyXRP and the XRP Ledger. Ripple's main focus is as a payment settlement asset exchange and remittance system, similar to the SWIFT system for international money and security transfers used by banks and financial intermediaries dealing across currencies.\n\nRipple's products serve as a sort of temporary global settlement layer for businesses and individuals.\n\nRipple operates in the financial technology industry, providing blockchain and cryptocurrency cross-border payment, crypto liquidity, and central bank digital currency services. Its platforms use the XRP Ledger and its native token,XRP, in its services.\n\nRipple is unique in this industry as it created the first financial services platform and network that accesses and uses blockchain and cryptocurrency for enterprises. It has developed products that provide liquidity and uses cryptocurrency and a bridge currency to speed up international transactions and reduce costs.\n\nAdditionally, Ripple has helped countries create their owncentral bank digital currencies (CBDCs)through its Ripple CBDC platform.\n\nSince 2012, Ripple has had 14 fund-raising rounds, raising a total of $293.8 million. The most recent backers include Uday Kumar Bangalore Shivaraman, The K Fund, and Azure Ventures Group.\n\nThe company's most recent valuation was over $11 billion, which includes a rumored $285 million stock repurchase in 2024.\n\nRipple was founded in 2012 by Chris Larsen, David Schwartz, Author Britto, and Jed McCaleb after work began on the XRP Ledger. The company's original name was OpenCoin, but it quickly went through a series of name changes until finally becoming Ripple.\n\nRipple's current leadership is:\n\nRipple has been expanding its capabilities by acquiring companies involved in cryptocurrency and technology that complements it. In 2024 and 2023, it acquired Standard Custody & Trust and Metaco, crypto custody services providers. These acquisitions will likely help Ripple with its plans to offer crypto liquidity services to institutions in addition to institutional decentralized finance solutions.\n\nIn 2020,Ripple was suedby the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Commission alleged the business had sold unregistered securities in its fundraising activities.\n\nIn 2023, Judge Analisa Torres decided that XRP was not a security when sold on exchanges but was a security when sold to institutional investors. The SEC dropped all charges against Chris Larsen and Brad Garlinghouse but continued to insist on fining Ripple nearly $2 billion, which Ripple contested.\n\nIn August 2024, Ripple was ordered to pay the SEC $125 million in fines, and the case was finalized.\n\nRipple also introduced its stablecoin in 2024, backed by cash and cash equivalents. The stablecoin was approved by the New York Department of Financial Services in January 2025, and the company has partnered with major centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nRipple has positioned itself as a company that can help businesses access blockchain and cryptocurrency for payment services without building and maintaining a blockchain or using a public blockchain and crypto. With this in mind, the company's future depends on demand for its products and services.\n\nRipple's stablecoin (RLUSD) was approved by the New York Department of Financial Services in January 2025 and is available for purchase on major global exchanges, Uphold, Bitstamp, Bitso, MoonPay, Independent Reserve, CoinMENA, Sologenic, and Bullish.\n\nRLUSD is a different type of virtual asset, so it won't use XRP. It is supposed to be fully backed by cash and cash equivalents at a ratio of 1:1.\n\nRipple is a blockchain services and tech company that provides financial services for companies worldwide. It was started by some of the same developers who created XRP and the XRP Ledger. Ripple uses the XRP ledger to develop its products and services, but it does not own, maintain, or develop the ledger or cryptocurrency.\n\nRipple is the first business to incorporate blockchain and cryptocurrency into a global enterprise financial network. It operates in a new industry, so there have been many speed bumps, such as regulatory concerns and lawsuits.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
