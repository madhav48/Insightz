  "definition": "Operating margin is a company's profit for every dollar of sales after deducting production costs like wages and raw materials but before accounting for interest and taxes.\n\nA company's operating margin is the amount it makes on every dollar of sales after deducting thevariable costsinvolved but before accounting for interest or taxes. Operating margin is calculated by dividing the company\u2019s operating income by itsnet sales.\n\nA higher ratio in an operating margin is generally better, as it indicates the company is efficient in its operations and is good at turning sales into profits.\n\nA company\u2019s operating margin, sometimes referred to asreturn on sales(ROS), is a good indicator of how well it is being managed and how efficient it is at generating profits from sales. It shows the proportion of revenues that are available to cover non-operating costs, such as payinginterest, which is why investors and lenders pay close attention to it.\n\nHighly variable operating margins are a prime indicator of business risk. By the same token, looking at a company\u2019s past operating margins is a good way to gauge whether a company's performance has been getting better. The operating margin can improve through better management controls, more efficient use of resources, improved pricing, and more effective marketing.\n\nIn its essence, the operating margin is how much profit a company makes from its core business in relation to its total revenues. This allows investors to see if a company is generating income primarily from its core operations or from other means, such as investing.\n\nThe formula for operating margin is:\n\n\ufeffOperating\u00a0Margin=Operating\u00a0EarningsRevenue\\begin{aligned} \\text{Operating Margin}=\\frac{\\text{Operating Earnings}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\end{aligned}Operating\u00a0Margin=RevenueOperating\u00a0Earnings\u200b\u200b\ufeff\ufeff\n\nWhen calculating operating margin, the numerator uses a firm'searnings before interest and taxes(EBIT). EBIT, oroperating earnings, is calculated simply as revenue minuscost of goods sold(COGS) and the regular selling, general, and administrative costs of running a business, excluding interest and taxes.\n\nFor example, if a company had revenues of $2 million, COGS of $700,000, andadministrative expensesof $500,000, its operating earnings would be $2 million - ($700,000 + $500,000) = $800,000. Its operating margin would then be $800,000 / $2 million = 40%.\n\nIf the company was able to negotiate better prices with its suppliers, reducing its COGS to $500,000, then it would see an improvement in its operating margin to 50%.\n\nThe operating margin should only be used to compare companies that operate in the same industry and, ideally, have similarbusiness modelsand annual sales. Companies in different industries with wildly different business models have very different operating margins, so comparing them would be meaningless. It would not be an apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nTo make it easier to compare profitabilitybetween companies and industries, many analysts use a profitability ratio that eliminates the effects of financing, accounting, and tax policies:earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,\u00a0and amortization(EBITDA). For example, by adding back depreciation, the operating margins of big manufacturing firms and heavy industrial companies are more comparable.\n\nEBITDA is sometimes used as a proxy foroperating cash flowbecause it excludes non-cash expenses, such as depreciation. However, EBITDA does not equal cash flow. This is because it does not adjust for any increase inworking capitalor account for capital expenditure that is needed to support production and maintain a company\u2019s asset base\u2014as operating cash flow does.\n\nBy comparing EBIT to sales,operating profit marginsshow how successful a company's management has been at generating income from the operation of the business.\u00a0 There are several other margin calculations that businesses and analysts can employ to get slightly different insights into a firm's profitability.\n\nThegross margintells us how much profit a company makes on its cost of sales or\u00a0COGS. In other words, it indicates how efficiently management uses labor and supplies in the production process.\n\nThenet marginconsiders the net profits generated from all segments of a business, accounting for all costs and accounting items incurred, including taxes and depreciation. In other words, this ratio comparesnet incomewith sales. It comes as close as possible to summing up in a single figure how effectively the managers are running a business.\n\nThe operating margin is an important measure of a company's overall profitability from operations. It is the ratio of operating profits to\u00a0revenues\u00a0for a company or business segment.\n\nExpressed as a percentage, the operating margin\u00a0shows how much earnings from operations is generated from every $1 in sales after accounting for the direct costs involved in earning those revenues. Larger margins mean that more of every dollar in sales is kept as profit.\n\nWhen a company's operating margin exceeds the average for its industry, it is said to have acompetitive advantage, meaning it is more successful than other companies that have similar operations. While the average margin for different industries varies widely, businesses can gain a competitive advantage in general byincreasing sales or reducing expenses\u2014or both.\n\nBoosting sales, however, often involves spending more money to do so, which equals greater costs. Cutting too many costs can also lead to undesirable outcomes, including losing skilled workers, shifting to inferior materials, or other losses in quality. Cutting advertising budgets may also harm sales.\n\nTo reduce the cost of production without sacrificing quality, the best option for many businesses is expansion.Economies of scalerefer to the idea that larger companies tend to be more profitable. A large business's increased level of production means that the cost of each item is reduced in several ways. For example, raw materials purchased in bulk are often discounted by wholesalers.\n\nOperating margin takes into account all operating costs but excludes any non-operating costs. Net profit margin takes into account all costs involved in a sale, making it the most comprehensive and conservative measure of profitability. Gross margin, on the other hand, simply looks at the costs of goods sold (COGS) and ignores things such asoverhead, fixed costs, interest expenses, and taxes.\n\nHigh-profit margin sectors are typically those where competitive pressures allow companies to generate sales that are produced without having to spend much on development, marketing, overheads, and production. Initially, start-up companies may make losses until they establish themselves. For example, software or gaming companies may invest initially while developing a particular software/game and cash in big later by simply selling millions of copies with very few expenses.\n\nOperations-intensive businesses such as transportation, which may have to deal with fluctuating fuel prices, drivers\u2019 perks and retention, and vehicle maintenance, usually have lower profit margins. Automobiles also have low profit margins, as profits and sales are limited by intense competition, uncertain consumer demand, and high operational expenses involved in developing dealership networks and logistics.",
