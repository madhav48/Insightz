  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA brand is a product or a business with a distinct identity among consumers. A brand is created through design, packaging, and advertising elements that distinguish the product from its competitors. The product contributes to the company'sbrand equity. A successful brand adds enormous value to a company, giving it a competitive edge over others in the same industry. As such, many companies gettrademarksto legally protect their brands.\n\nA brand is a specific feature that identifies a company's products and services. This feature can be a name, slogan, logo, or design. Some common examples include the Nike swoosh, the Golden Arches, or the Maxwell House slogan \"Good to the Last Drop.\" When you see or hear these, there's a very good chance that you'll identify the company and its products and services.\n\nCompanies spend a significant amount of time and money developing and maintaining their brands, which is why there is a great deal of research and marketing involved. Once established, companies seek legal ways to protect their brands, such astrademarks, as they become valuable assets.\n\nBrands convey a message that a product is more effective, easier to use, better tasting, cheaper, classier, hipper, or more environmentally sound than its competitors. This is especially challenging when the product has cheaper alternatives. For instance, Advil is a brand name for ibuprofen. Through effective advertising and packaging, itsparent companyattempts to convince consumers that Advil\u2019s ibuprofen is a better choice than the cheaper generic versions.\n\nNewer brands face a great deal more urgency in establishing themselves with consumers. To build customer loyalty, a brand needs to convey how it can deliver its product, whether it is making it enjoyable to buy, functional, valuable, and memorable to customers. A core part of building a brand is understanding the customer base to know how to deliver each of these aspects.\n\nSuccessfulmarketingkeeps a company\u2019s brand front and center in people\u2019s minds, at least at the moment of decision-making. That\u2019s why the brand is considered to be one of a company\u2019s most valuable and importantassets. It carries tremendous monetary value, affecting both thebottom lineand, for public companies,shareholder value.\n\nA company can become inseparable from its brand.Coca-Cola, the soft drink, is synonymous with the company itself, even though the company now owns Schweppes, Dasani, and Hi-C, among hundreds of other brands.\n\nTrademarks identify exclusive ownership of a brand and its associated marketing tools.Registering trademarksprevents others from using substantially identical products or services without permission.\n\nThe concept of branding may go as far back as 2000 B.C.E. when merchants began considering how they could sell their wares more effectively. Merchants in ancient Babylon developed sales pitches to lure in customers. Craftsmen branded or carved symbols on their merchandise to indicate their origin. Tavern owners hung attractive signs outside.\n\nThe word branding for product marketing might have come into use in the 19th century when Western cattle ranchers started using hot irons to mark their livestock with the ranch\u2019s initials or a symbol. Their initial purpose was less marketing than protection from cattle rustlers, but the association stuck.\n\nBranding as mass marketing took off in the 19th century, as sellers of products like flour began thinking about ways to distinguish themselves from their competitors.\n\nWhen a company seeks to define its public image, it first must determine its brand identity or how it wants to be viewed by the public. The goal is to make the brand memorable and appealing to the target consumer, whether that is hip single people, couples with small children, or affluent retirees.\n\nThe company may use a design firm or logo design software to come up with ideas for the visual aspects of a brand, such as its logo. A successful brand accurately portrays the message or feeling that the company wants to get across. This results inbrand awareness, or recognition of the brand\u2019s existence and what it offers.\n\nOnce a brand has created positive sentiment among its target audience, the firm is said to have built brand equity. Some firms with brand equity and veryrecognizable product brandsinclude Disney,\u00a0Coca-Cola, Ferrari, Apple,\u00a0and Nike.\n\nIf done right, a brand results in an increase in sales not only for the specific product being sold but also for other products sold by the same company. A good brand engenders trust, and, after having a good experience with one product, the consumer is more likely to tryanother product related to the same brand. The phenomenon is known asbrand loyalty.\n\nConsumers buy brands that reflect their values. A brand\u2019s social responsibility efforts are important to 64% of consumers, market research company Leger reported in 2022.\n\nThe type of brand used depends on the entity using it. The following are some of the most common forms of brands.\n\nCorporate branding is a way for companies to enhance their reputations and distinguish themselves from competitors in their industries. The company\u2019s pricing, mission, andtarget marketall reflect the corporate brand. The goal is to define their personalities, purpose, and values. As noted above, corporations commonly use logos, slogans, imaging, style, and messaging as tools to convey their brands.\n\nSome of the most notable examples of corporate branding include Google, Apple, Nike, Tesla, andStarbucks. Not only have these companies built up product brands, but they've also managed to use promotions, slogans, and other tools to boost their names in the market.\n\nSocial mediaenabled ordinary people to become influencers. Their financial success depends on their ability to createa brand that attracts an audiencethat certain advertisers want to reach. Personal brands are built through social media posts, sharing images and videos, and conducting meet-and-greets.\n\nThe Kardashian family members developed brand value after gaining popularity from their long-running reality show. Collectively and as individuals, they have used their name to successfully launch media and modeling careers, spinoff shows, cosmetics, perfumes, and clothing lines.\n\nFor instance,Kylie Jennersold 51% of her makeup line, Kylie Cosmetics, to Coty for $600 million in 2020. This was largely due to the success of her social media presence, which stood at 397 million Instagram followers as of September 2024.\n\nIntroducing a new product or supporting an existing product involves creating and maintaining its brand. Branding a product starts withmarket researchand identifying the right target market.\n\nCompanies might choose to create amaster brand identity. The Virgin Group, founded by Richard Branson, includes hotels, telecommunications, and airlines, but all sub-brands carry the master brand identity.\n\nThe top five global brands in 2023 were Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Samsung, according to a ranking by Interbrand. Microsoft\u2019s score was up a big 14% year over year.\n\nCreating a brand provides numerous benefits to acorporationor an individual. A company that gets its message across can induce and evoke emotion within its customers, resulting in unique relationships. The companies rely on these customers to help draw in others. This helps companies build trust and credibility that give them a competitive edge against the competition.\n\nIt also helps companies introducenew productsand services. Consumers stay loyal to brands they know and trust, and with which they already have a relationship. That makes them more likely to spend when new products are released, even if they\u2019re more expensive.\n\nAppleis a classic example. The company built a hugely loyal customer base that is willing to overlook the higher price tag associated with an iMac, MacBook, iPad, oriPhonebecause of their loyalty to the brand. Its customers don\u2019t hesitate to replace their existing Apple gadgets with new Apple gadgets as the company releases them.\n\nCompanies use brands to give consumers reasons to buy their products over those of their competitors. We've highlighted several examples of major brands above, but here are two more.\n\nIntroduced in the 1950s, the Good Hands\u00ae Beacon and the slogan \"You're in good hands\u00ae\" have become synonymous with Allstate. They suggest that the company's insurance customers can count on it being reliable and competent when they need its help. Its commercials reinforce the message.\n\nOther slogans may be harder to translate but are an intrinsic part of a brand\u2019s identity. For example, the slogan for Kellogg\u2019s Rice Krispies has been \u201cSnap! Crackle! Pop!\u201d has been around since the 1930s. The idea is that the cereal adds a pleasing sound to your breakfast while evoking images of the cheery elves that serve as its spokespeople.\n\nA brand is a product or service that has a unique and immediately recognizable identity that distinguishes itself from others in its industry. The consumer associates the product name, label, and packaging with particular attributes such as value, quality, or tastefulness.\n\nA cough drop is just a cough drop. But when you go to buy a bag of them, you might choose Ricola, Luden\u2019s, or Beekeeper\u2019s Naturals at least in part based on the brand message that you have received.\n\nBrand equity is the commercial value of a product\u2019s reputation to the company that owns it. A company\u2019s price may be determined by adding up the value of its buildings, inventory, and equipment. But its value increases if the company owns one or more brands that have attained a solid reputation with consumers.\n\nA select number of brands have lasted for centuries, such as Stella Artois, which dates back to 1366.The Chevy Suburban traces back to 1935, and remains a car brand that is still in circulation today.\n\nAt the same time, some of America\u2019s greatest brands have died. They may have failed to keep up with the times, or the businesses that owned them may have mismanaged them.\n\nBobVila.com lists these brands, all of them once household names, that have vanished: Borders, Pan American, F.W. Woolworth, Toys R Us, Blockbuster, Tower Records, Compaq, Oldsmobile, and Howard Johnson\u2019s.\n\nTo be fair, Toys R Us made a comeback in 2022 as a store-within-a-store at Macy\u2019s locations.\n\nWhen we hear the word \u201cbrand,\u201d most of us think of a logo, slogan, or other identifiable mark. But that\u2019s just one part of the definition. The term \u201cbrand\u201d is actually an intangible marketing concept that helps people recognize and identify a product and, at best, reach for it instead of one of its competitors.\n\nA company\u2019s brands are among the most important and valuable assets that it owns. They can make or break a company. That\u2019s why companies do extensive research before launching a new product along with identifying its target market. From there, every aspect of its content, design, and marketing is tailored to the brand identity that they want to create for that market.\n\nLondon College of Contemporary Arts. \u201cHistory of Branding.\u201d\n\nCourse Sidekick. \u201cProduct Packaging and Branding.\u201d\n\nLeger \"Consumer Trends 2022: Corporate Social Responsibility and Consumer Activism.\"\n\nCoty. \"Coty and Kylie Jenner Announce Strategic Partnership To Expand Beauty Brands Globally.\"\n\n99designs, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cThe 8 Types of Branding (and How to Use Them).\u201d\n\nInterbrand. \u201cBest Global Brands 2023.\u201d Pages 5, 81.\n\nAllstate. \"The Good Hands: How a Pivotal Family Moment Inspired Allstate's Longstanding Symbol of Protection.\"\n\nKellogg's Rice Krispies. \"Our History.\"\n\nStella Artois. \"It\u2019s All in the Name.\"\n\nMotorTrend. \"Chevrolet Suburban Timeline: Hits and Highlights From America\u2019s Longest-Lived Nameplate.\"\n\nBob Vila. \u201c9 Iconic American Brands That No Longer Exist.\u201d\n\nDigital Commerce 360. \"Toys R Us Is Opening Shops in All Macy's Stores.\"",
