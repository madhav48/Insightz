  "term": "Price Skimming: Definition, How It Works, and Limitations",
  "definition": "Price skimming is often used when a new product type enters the market, boosting the price at the onset with the intent of reducing it later.\n\nThe goal of price skimming is to gather as muchrevenuefrom a new product as possible while consumer demand for the product is high and competition hasn't yet entered the market. The company then reduces the product\u2019s price to reach a different, thriftier subset of customers as competitors begin to edge into the game.\n\n\"Price skimming\" originates from \"skimming\" layers, like removing successive layers of cream from the top of milk. Unlikepenetration pricing, which starts with a low price to attract a large customer base quickly, price skimming leverages initial high prices to maximize early profits before adjusting to more competitive levels.\n\nPrice skimming is often used when a new product type enters the market. The goal is to gather as muchrevenueas possible while high consumer demand and competition haven't entered the market.\n\nThis approach works well for products with a high perceived value or innovative features, where early adopters are less sensitive to price. Initially targeting these consumers, companies can recover their investment quickly and generate significant early profits. Once the market becomes more saturated with competitors, lowering the price helps capture a broader audience and maintain market share.\n\nKey factors for effective price skimming include understanding the product's life cycle, projected demand, and the competitive landscape. High demand allows for higher initial prices, while increased competition necessitates price adjustments.\n\nSkimming can encourage the entry of competitors since other firms will notice the artificially high margins available in the product, they will quickly enter.\n\nThis approach contrasts with thepenetration pricingmodel, which focuses on releasing a lower-priced product to grab as much market share as possible. This technique is generally better suited for lower-cost items, such as basic household supplies, where price may be a driving factor in most customers' production selections.\n\nFirms often use price skimming to recover development costs and in situations where:\n\nFor new products, like innovative home technology, a high initial price can signal quality and exclusivity. This attracts early adopters willing to spend more and can generate valuable word-of-mouth marketing.\n\nOne of the most common examples of price skimming is the launch of Apple's iPhone. When Apple introduces a new iPhone model, it tends to set a high initial price to target early adopters willing to pay a premium for the latest technology. However, as demand from this segment is met and newer iPhone models are released, Apple gradually lowers the price of the older models to attract more price-sensitive customers.\n\nThis strategy allows Apple to maximize early revenue from a new product and gradually expand its market reach without alienating different customer segments. By lowering prices over time, Apple can remain competitive and continues to generate sales throughout the product's life cycle.\n\nPrice skimming carries a timing risk; customers may switch to cheaper alternatives if the price reduction occurs too late. This could lead to lost sales and reduced revenue as competitors capture more price-sensitive customers. However, there's also the risk of dropping prices too early. For example, when Apple reduced the price of its iPhone by a third after only two months on the market, loyal buyers complained, forcing CEO Steve Jobs to apologize and offer a partial rebate.\n\nGenerally, the price skimming model is best used for a short time, allowing the early adopter market to become saturated but not alienating price-conscious buyers over the long term. If the price isn't reduced promptly, consumers may turn to cheaper competitors, resulting in lost sales and revenue.\n\nPrice skimming may also be less effective for any competitor's follow-up products. For example, once the initial market of early adopters has purchased the latest gaming console, other buyers may not purchase a competing product at a higher price without significant improvements over the original.\n\nPrice skimming is a strategy where a company introduces a new or innovative product at a high price to maximize revenue from customers willing to pay a premium. Once the demand from these early adopters is met, the company gradually reduces the price to attract more price-sensitive buyers. This method helps maximize profits in the early stages of the product's life cycle and assists in recovering development costs.\n\nNo, price skimming isn't illegal. However, if not executed correctly, it can cost a company a buyer's trust. The key to the strategy is to price the product right at launch and then time the price reduction appropriately. When done correctly, it can maximize revenue without alienating customers.\n\nPrice skimming is commonly used by businesses in industries where products have high initial development costs and significant consumer interest. This includes technology companies like Apple and Samsung, which use this strategy for new smartphone and gadget launches, as well as high-end fashion brands and automobile makers.\n\nPrice skimming sets high initial prices for new, innovative products to target early adopters, then lowers prices over time to attract more budget-conscious buyers. This approach maximizes early profits and helps recover development costs, as seen with Apple's iPhone. However, timing is critical; for example, delaying price cuts can drive customers to competitors.\n\nThough effective, price skimming works best for highly innovation products or products with a high perceived value. It's less successful for follow-up competitor products because the early adopter market may already be saturated.\n\nCorporate Finance Institute. \"Price Skimming.\"\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities. \"15.3 Pricing Strategies.\"\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities. \"15.3 Pricing Strategies.\"\n\nPennState Extension. \"Understanding Pricing Objectives and Strategies for the Value-Added Ag Producer.\"\n\nPennState Extension. \"Understanding Pricing Objectives and Strategies for the Value-Added Ag Producer.\"\n\nKnowledge at Wharton. \"The Price Is Right, but Maybe It\u2019s Not, and How Do You Know?\"\n\nKnowledge at Wharton. \"The Price Is Right, but Maybe It\u2019s Not, and How Do You Know?\"",
