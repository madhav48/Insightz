  "definition": "Net foreign factor income (NFFI) is the difference between a nation\u2019sgross national product(GNP) and itsgross domestic product(GDP).\n\nNFFI is the difference between the aggregate amount that a country\u2019s citizens and companies earn abroad and the aggregate amount that foreign citizens and overseas companies earn in that country. In mathematical terms:\n\nNFFI=GNP\u2212GDPGNP=gross\u00a0national\u00a0productGDP=gross\u00a0domestic\u00a0product\\begin{aligned}&NFFI\\ =\\ GNP\\ - \\ GDP\\\\&GNP=\\text{gross national product}\\\\&GDP=\\text{gross domestic product}\\end{aligned}\u200bNFFI=GNP\u2212GDPGNP=gross\u00a0national\u00a0productGDP=gross\u00a0domestic\u00a0product\u200b\n\nThe NFFI\u00a0level is generally not substantial in most nations since payments earned by citizens and those paid to foreigners more or less offset each other. However, NFFI's impact may be significant in smaller nations with substantialforeign investmentin relation to their economy and few assets overseas, since their GDP will be quite high compared to GNP.\n\nGDP refers to all economic output that occurs domestically or within a nation\u2019s boundaries, regardless of whether a local company or foreign entity owns production. GNP, on the other hand, measures the output from the citizens and companies of a particular nation, regardless of whether they are located within its boundaries or overseas. For example, if a Japanese company has a production facility in the U.S., its output will count toward U.S. GDP and Japan\u2019s GNP.\n\nGDP is the most widely accepted measure of economic output, having supplanted GNP around 1990.\u00a0In making the switch, theBureau of Economic Analysis(BEA) said\u00a0GDP provided a more straightforward comparison of other measures of economic activity in the United States and that it would be helpful to have a standard measure of economic output\u2014most\u00a0other countries at the time had\u00a0already adopted GDP as their primary measure of production.\n\nManyeconomistshave questioned how meaningful GNP or GDP is as a measure of a nation's economic well-being since they\u00a0do\u00a0not count most\u00a0unpaid work\u00a0while counting economic activity that is unproductive or destructive.\n\nSeveral\u00a0economists\u00a0still criticize GDP, specifically\u00a0for providing a somewhat misleading picture of an economy's true health and the well-being of its citizens. This is because GDP does not take into account the profits earned in a nation by overseas companies that are remitted back to foreign investors. If these remitted profits are very large compared with earnings from the nation\u2019s overseas citizens and assets, the NFFI figure will be negative, and GNP will be significantly below GDP.\n\nNFFI may assume increasing importance in a globalized economy, as people and companies move across international borders more easily than they did in the past.\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis. \"The Changeover from GNP to GDP.\"",
