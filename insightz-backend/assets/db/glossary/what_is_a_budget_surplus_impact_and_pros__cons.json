  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA budget surplus is when an entity brings in more money than it spends during a certain period.\n\nA budgetsurplusoccurs when a business or government's revenue exceeds its expenses during its fiscal year. Strong growth, high tax or sales revenue, and a drop in spending can all lead to a budget surplus. The surplus can be used to pay for research, new projects, or existing debt. A surplus can be risky, though, as businesses are less likely to invest when the economy is strong. The opposite of a surplus is a budget deficit, which occurs when expenses exceed revenue.\n\nAs noted above, the term budget surplus is often used to define the financial situation of a company or government. These entities often run in surpluses when income or revenue exceeds spending or when there are shifts in the economic climate or the way governments spend taxpayers' money. An increase in taxes can also result in a budget surplus. Individuals can run surpluses, but their surpluses are commonly called savings.\n\nA surplus implies the government has extra funds, which can be used for many different purposes including making purchases, paying off debts, or saving for future generations. A surplus indicates that its finances are being managed effectively.\u00a0The following are some of the ways surpluses may be used:\n\nA budget surplus can often be an indicator of a healthy economy but it is not necessary for a government to maintain a surplus. The U.S. has rarely run a budget surplus and experienced long periods ofeconomic growthwhile running a budget deficit, which is the opposite of a surplus.Abudget deficitoccurs when expenditures exceed income. Money is borrowed and interest is paid when a deficit occurs.\n\nAbalanced budget, on the other hand, exists when expenditures equal income.\n\nHaving funds in the coffers can be a sign of prudent spending but that doesn't mean that running a surplus is always beneficial. It can sometimes come with its own problems.\n\nThe main risks of running a budget surplus are the decline in investment revenue and highertaxation. When companies or governments run a surplus, they're not spending or investing as much. When investment drops,returnsaren't generated. Similarly, when there's a drop in revenue, there isn't enough money going through the economy. In order to compensate and preventdeflation, governments may have to raise taxes and companies may need to raise prices.\n\nKeynesian economics theorysuggests that entities should run a surplus during times of prosperity and a deficit during a downcycle ordepression. This allows the company or government to save money when it is well off and to spend money oneconomic stimuluswhen the economy is less well off.\n\nThe size of the national deficit in the United States as of October 2024.\n\nThere is no simple answer as to whether a budget surplus is good or bad. Running a surplus has its advantages, the same way running a deficit does. The best action depends on the entity's specific economic situation and priorities. Having said that, we've highlighted some of the most common pros and cons of running a budget surplus.\n\nRunning a budget surplus means there is additional money to spend at the end of the accounting period, which is generally afiscal year. This extra cash can be used to pay off debts or be reinvested in other projects. It can even be returned to the public in the form of price ortax cuts.\n\nA large surplus also reduces the need for borrowing through corporate or governmentbondissues. This will reduce interest rates in that country, allowing people and businesses to borrow money at a lower cost.\n\nRunning a surplus is not always an unmixed blessing. Although it may seem wise for a government to save money, those savings mean that the wider economy will not benefit from themultiplier effectof government spending. In addition, those savings could mean less spending on public services.\n\nA budget surplus can also affect a company's economic standing or a country's inflation levels andgross domestic product (GDP). In the case of governments, spending is one of the four components of GDP, meaning that a government that struggles to reduce its spending will ultimately reduce its GDP. Since lower spending reduces the amount of money circulating in an economy, deflation can occur.\n\nFacilitates the saving of money\n\nIncreases credit ratings and reduces borrowing costs\n\nLowers interest rates and encourages economic activity\n\nCan lead to price hikes or excessive taxation\n\nLess economic stimulus from spending\n\nReduces the amount of money circulating in an economy, potentially causing deflation\n\nTheU.S. Treasuryreleases government budget information on a monthly basis. Budget surplus or deficit data appears in the statements, which summarize whether the government is spending or collecting more money than expected. In addition, the data records future collections or changes to the budget.\n\nAs noted above, the U.S. government eliminated a largebudget deficitwhile Bill Clinton was president. This resulted in a budget surplus. In the 2000 fiscal year, revenue came in at $2.025 trillion, while the total spending bill for the year ended up at $1.788 trillion. This resulted in a budget surplus of about $236 billion.\n\nThis surplus ended just after theSeptember 11attacks in 2001. The federal government has been running at a deficit since then, although the size of the deficit rose and fell in accordance with economic circumstances. For instance, the deficit grew to $1.41 trillion in 2009 in the aftermath of theGreat Recession, before slowly declining as the economy recovered. This was the highest deficit of the 21st century\u2014at least until the COVID-19 pandemic, when the deficit again ballooned to more than $3 trillion.\n\nA budget surplus is generally considered a good thing because it means that the government has money left over that can be reinvested or spent to pay off debts. However, it depends on how wisely the government is spending money. If the government has a surplus because of high taxes or reduced public services, that can result in a net loss for the economy as a whole.\n\nA budget surplus is when a body (such as the U.S. government) spends less money during an accounting period than it takes in through revenue. A deficit is when spending is higher than revenue, requiring the government to borrow money in order to finance its activities.\n\nThe U.S. budget is running a deficit of over $1.9 trillion as of October 2024.\n\nYes. During the Clinton presidency, the federal government was able to reduce spending and increase revenues, turning a large deficit into a small surplus. The last year where the government ran a budget surplus was in 2001.\n\nBudget surpluses occur whenever an entity has more income than it spends. This includes companies and governments. Individuals can also have surpluses, although they're normally called savings. Having a surplus can be beneficial because those funds can be used to pay off debt or fund new investments. But there are risks to running a surplus, which include increased taxation or pricing and a loss of revenue. So whether an entity runs a surplus or a deficit can often be a double-edged sword.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Real Gross Domestic Product.\"\n\nThe White House. \"Historical Tables,\" Table 1.1.\n\nFiscal Data. \"What is the national deficit?\"\n\nBureau of the Fiscal Service. \"Monthly Treasury Statement.\"\n\nStatista. \"Surplus or Deficit of the U.S. Budget in Fiscal Years 2000 to 2026.\"",
