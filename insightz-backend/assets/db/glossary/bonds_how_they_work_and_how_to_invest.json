  "term": "Bonds: How They Work and How to Invest",
  "definition": "A bond is a fixed-income investment issued by governments or corporations to raise funding.\n\nA bond is a fixed-income investment product where individuals lend money to a government or company at a specified interest rate for a predetermined period. The entity repays individuals with interest in addition to the original face value of the bond.\n\nBonds are used by companies, municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to finance projects and operations. Owners of bonds are debtholders, or creditors, of the issuer. Bond details include the end date when the principal of the loan is due to be paid to the bond owner and usually include the terms for variable or fixed interest payments made by the borrower.\n\nBonds are debt instruments and represent loans made to the issuer. Bonds allow individual investors to assume the role of the lender. Governments and corporations commonly use bonds to borrow money to fund roads, schools, dams, or other infrastructure projects. Corporations often borrow to grow their business, buy property and equipment, undertake profitable projects, for research and development, or hire employees.\n\nBonds arefixed-income securitiesand are one of the main asset classes for individual investors, along with equities and cash equivalents. The borrower issues a bond that includes the terms of the loan, interest payments that will be made, and the maturity date the bond principal must be repaid. The interest payment is part of the return that bondholders earn for loaning their funds to the issuer. The interest rate that determines the payment is called the coupon rate.\n\nThe initial price of most bonds is typically set at what is called their par value, or the face value of one bond. The actual market price of a bond depends on the credit quality of the issuer, the length of time until expiration, and the coupon rate compared to the general interest rate environment. The face value of the bond is what is paid to the lender once the bond matures.\n\nMarkets allow lenders to buy or sell their bonds to other investors long after the original issuing organization raised capital. A bond investor does not have to hold a bond through to its maturity date.\n\nThere are four primarycategories of bondssold in the markets. However, you may also see foreign bonds issued by global corporations and governments on some platforms.\n\nA bond's price changes daily where supply and demand determine that observed price. If an investor holds a bond to maturity they will get their principal back plus interest. However, a bondholder can sell their bonds in the open market, where the price can fluctuate. a bond\u2019s price varies inversely with interest rates. When interest rates go up, bond prices fall to have the effect of equalizing the interest rate on the bond with prevailing rates, and vice versa.\n\nThe issuer of a fixed-rate bond promises to pay a coupon based on the face value of the bond. For a $1,000 par, 10% annual coupon bond, the issuer will pay the bondholder $100 each year. If prevailing market interest rates are also 10% at the time this bond is issued, an investor would be indifferent to investing in the corporate bond or the government bond since both would return $100. However, if interest rates drop to 5%, the investor can only receive $50 from the government bond but would still receive $100 from thecorporate bond.\n\nInvestors bid up to the price of the bond until it trades at a premium that equalizes the prevailing interest rate environment\u2014in this case, the bond will trade at $2,000 so that the $100 coupon represents 5%.Likewise, if interest rates soared to 15%, then an investor could make $150 from the government bond and would not pay $1,000 to earn just $100. This bond would be sold until it reached a price that equalized the yields, in this case, to a price of $666.67.\n\nTheyield-to-maturity(YTM) is the total return anticipated on a bond if the bond is held until the end of its lifetime. Yield to maturity is considered a long-term bond yield but is expressed as an annual rate.\n\nYTM is the internal rate of return of an investment in a bond if the investor holds the bond until maturity and if all payments are made as scheduled. YTM evaluates the attractiveness of one bond relative to other bonds of different coupons and maturity in the market. The formula for YTM involves solving for the interest rate.\n\nInvestors can measure the anticipated changes in bond prices given a change in interest rates with the duration of a bond. Duration represents the price change in a bond given a 1% change in interest rates. This practical definition is the modified duration of a bond. Bonds with long maturities, and also bonds with low coupons have the greatest sensitivity to interest rate changes.\n\nWhile there are some specialized bond brokers, most online and discount brokers offer access to bond markets, and investors can buy them like stocks. Treasury bonds and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities are typically sold directly via the federal government and can be purchased via its TreasuryDirect website. Investors can also buy bonds indirectly via fixed-income ETFs or mutual funds that invest in a portfolio of bonds.

If the issuer has a poor credit rating, the risk of default is greater, and these bonds pay more interest. Bonds that have a very long maturity date also usually pay a higher interest rate. This higher compensation is because the bondholder is more exposed to interest rate and inflation risks for an extended period.\n\nCredit ratings for a company and its bonds are generated by credit rating agencies like Standard and Poor\u2019s, Moody\u2019s, and Fitch Ratings. The very highest quality bonds are called \u201cinvestment grade\u201d and include debt issued by the U.S. government and very stable companies, such as utilities. Bonds that are not considered investment grade but are not in default are called \u201chigh yield\u201d or \u201cjunk\u201d bonds. These bonds have a higher risk of default in the future and investors demand a higher coupon payment to compensate them for that risk.\n\nBonds andbond portfolioswill rise or fall in value as interest rates change. The sensitivity to changes in the interest rate environment is called \u201cduration.\u201d The use of the term duration in this context can be confusing to new bond investors because it does not refer to the length of time the bond has before maturity. Instead, duration describes how much a bond\u2019s price will rise or fall with a change in interest rates.\n\nBonds are issued by companies and governments to finance projects and fund operations. A bond is considered a fixed-income instrument since bonds traditionally pay a fixed interest rate to debtholders. Investors can purchase corporate bonds through financial institutions or online brokers or buy government bonds through the U.S. Treasury website.",
