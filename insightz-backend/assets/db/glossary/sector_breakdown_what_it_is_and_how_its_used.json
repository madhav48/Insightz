Fund companies regularly provide sector reporting in their marketing materials. Sector investing can influence investments in the fund. A fund may target a specific sector such as technology, or seek to diversify among many sectors.\n\nSome funds may have restraints on sector investments. This may occur with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) focused funds. These funds seek to exclude industries or companies that their investors consider undesirable for various reasons such as tobacco producers or oil exploration companies.\n\nAsector fundallocates 100% to a specified sector, such as healthcare, technology, or energy.\n\nTheGlobal Industry Classification Standard, also known as GICS, is the primary financial industry standard for defining sector classifications. GICS was developed by index providers MSCI and the S&P Dow Jones. Its hierarchy begins with 11 sectors which can be further delineated to 25 industry groups, 74 industries, and 163 sub-industries.

The sector also includes companies that offer oil and gas equipment and services.\n\nEvery company is assigned a GICS classification at the sub-industry level\n\naccording to its primary business activity. MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices use revenues and earnings to determine a company's principal business.\n\nSectors are broad classifications such as consumer staples, healthcare, or technology.
