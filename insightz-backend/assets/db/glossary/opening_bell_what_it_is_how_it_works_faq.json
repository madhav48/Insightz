  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nThe opening bell refers to the moment a securities exchange opens for its normal daily trading session. The time and conditions of the opening bell differ from one exchange to another.\n\nThe most famous opening bell is the one used by the New York Stock Exchange to signal the start of trading.\n\nSince 1985, theNew York Stock Exchange(NYSE) has used the opening bell to start its trading session at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. At the NYSE there is a physical bell and an automated ringer that sounds at the beginning of each trading day.On the Nasdaq exchange, where this is no physical trading floor, the opening of the market is referred to as the opening bell, but it is symbolic in significance.\n\nPhysicaltrading floorshave all but disappeared over the years with the rise ofelectronic trading. Investors and traders use the term opening bell to describe\u00a0the opening of a given market. The physical ringing of the opening bell has become a ceremonious event where dignitaries visiting the stock markets or companies that are trading for the first day are given the honor of ringing the bell.\n\nThis serves a useful function of drawing attention to the day's trading activities and helps maintain the interest of investors. For this reason, media companies such as CNBC, Fox, and Cheddar have on-location fixtures in the last of the well-known formal, physical trading floors in existence, the NYSE.\n\nWithout these media companies having a place to report on the trading session, the exchange would find it hard to justify the continued operation of the trading floor since so much there is automated anyway. Accordingly, the Nasdaq exchange, which was electronic from its inception, has no physical trading floor and has created a media space for the purpose of featuring its opening bell ceremonies.\n\nThe first bell was actually a large gong used on the NYSE to officially notify brokers and dealers that it was okay to begin the work of auctioning prices. However, in 1903, the gong was replaced by an electronically operated\u00a0brass bell.\u00a0The bell is accompanied by the gavel that is used in conjunction with the closing bell in recognition of 19thcentury stock calls.\n\nThe opening and closing bell can be viewed each day on the\u00a0the New York Stock Exchange\u2019s website.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Exchange open at 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time and close at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, but different exchanges all around the world open at different times of the day. For example, manyfuturesmarkets have an opening bell followed by a morning and afternoon session. Theoptionsmarkets also tend\u00a0to have different opening bells depending on the exchange. Traders should be aware of these times before trading in the market.\n\nIn the foreign exchange (forex) market, there is no opening bell since the market operates 24 hours a\u00a0day,\u00a0six days per week. The start of the trading day, however, is often considered to be 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time until the same time the next day.\n\nThe original opening bell at the NYSE was a Chinese gong.\n\nMany exchanges offerpre-market tradingthat occurs before the opening bell. During this time, traders and investors who have access to the extended session trading may place trades with one another.\n\nBut there are no market specialist or market makers during these hours, and trading is done with limit orders only. Trades must therefore be exact matches in terms of size and offer time. This means that trades made in these hours may take more time to fill and be less efficient in their pricing. As a result fewer traders participate in such sessions.\n\nOne notable exception is when earnings announcements are made. If a company announces its quarterly results before the opening bell, then an unusual flurry of activity is likely to take place on that particular stock.\n\nThe added participants all rushing to make trades based on the new information means that trading in those moments can occasionally mimic the speed and efficiency of price action that a regular session might provide. This flurry of activity may also occur sporadically based on news that is released overnight or before the opening bell.\n\nWhile pre-market trading has its advantages, there are several important risk factors. Pre-market trading tends to have lessliquiditythan trading during regular hours, which means thatbid-ask spreadsmay be wider and price action may be significantly more volatile.\n\nMany pre-market and after-hours traders are alsoinstitutional investorstrading inmutual fundsandhedge funds, which means that retail investors must compete with\u00a0professionals who are better equipped to work their orders than the average individual investor.\n\nSome markets, such as the forex and cryptocurrency markets, do not have an opening bell. Trading in those markets occurs every day, 24/7.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange rings the opening bell at 9:30 AM every day, except weekends and holidays. The Nasdaq opens at the same time, but as an automated market the bell is purely ceremonial.\n\nThe opening and closing bells on the stock market tell traders when they are allowed to start or stop trading. In early stock markets, this role was played by a gavel. In today's world of automated markets, the bell is less important, but it still plays a symbolic role.\n\nThe opening bell is an important symbol of the success of the stock market under capitalism, and the privilege of ringing it is often reserved for celebrities or VIPs. Traders often applaud when the market opens, particularly if the person ringing the bell is someone famous or highly accomplished.\n\nThe Nasdaq opens at 9:30 AM on weekdays. Although trading is automatic, the opening bell ritual has strong symbolic importance. Many business people see an opportunity to ring the bell as a chance to build their brands and highlight their companies.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange has a Bell Calendar that lists the people who are invited to ring the opening bell every day. Other stock exchanges may have their own bell calendars as well.\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. \"History of the Bell.\"\n\nNASDAQ. \"Bell Ringing Ceremony.\"\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. \"Bell Calendar.\"",
