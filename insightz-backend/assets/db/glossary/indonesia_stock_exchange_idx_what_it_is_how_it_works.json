The JSX was Indonesia's first stock exchange, founded in 1912 for the interest of the Dutch East India Company. The Jakarta Stock Exchange was closed during parts of World Wars I and II. When it reopened in 1952, the only exchanged security was the Indonesian governmentbond. The exchange became inactive from 1956\u20131977, and despite being reactivated in 1977, trading activity continued to be slow, with only a few dozen companies listed.\n\nRegulatory changes that were enacted between 1988 and 1992 improved trading activity. The exchange introduced its automatic trading system in 1995 and began to implement remote trading in 2002. In 2007, the Jakarta Stock Exchange merged with the Surabaya Stock Exchange to form the Indonesia Stock Exchange. In May of 2018, the exchange updated its trading system and created a new data center.\n\nEmerging marketslike Indonesia have their own set of additional risks for investors.\u00a0Emerging markets generally do not have the level ofmarket efficiencyand strict standards in accounting and securities regulation to be on par withadvanced economies(such as the United States, Europe, and Japan), but emerging markets do typically have a physical, financialinfrastructure, including banks, a stock exchange, and a unified currency.\n\nThe IDX has strived to become a credible and acknowledged world-class stock exchange.
