  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA generation-skipping trust (GST) is a type of legally binding trust agreement in which the contributedassetsare passed down to the grantor's grandchildren. They \"skip\" the next generation, the grantor's children. The assets avoidestate taxesthat would apply if the children directly inherited them because they're only taxed once.\n\nGeneration-skipping trusts can be effective wealth-preservation tools\u00a0for individuals with significant assets and savings.\n\nA generation-skippingtrusteffectively transfers assets from the grantor's estate to their grandchildren. Thegrantor's children never take title to the assets. This allows the estate to avoid a generation of estate taxes that would apply if the assets came into the possession of the next generation first.\n\nGrandchildren are the most common beneficiaries but the recipient of a generation-skipping transfer doesn't necessarily have to be a family member. The beneficiary can be anybody who is at least 37\u00bd years younger than the grantor and not a spouse or an ex-spouse.\n\nGeneration-skipping trusts can still provide some financial benefits to the next generation because the grantor can\u00a0give children access to any income the trust's assets generate\u00a0while still leaving the assets themselves in trust for their grandchildren.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax was first instituted in 1976. Changes were made to thetax codein 1986 to create the current version due to the generation-skipping trust's viability as a loophole to avoid federal estate taxes.Generation-skipping transfer tax rates have risen and fallen over the years with a high of 55% in 2001 and 2011, and a low of 0% in 2010 due to a complete exemption awarded by the 2010 Tax Relief Act.\n\nExemptions are intended to ensure that people transferring modest sums of wealth to younger generations don't have to bear the brunt of the tax burden. They were secured by theAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. The legislation established a permanent exemption, starting at $5 million and adjusting for inflation each year, on generation-skipping transfers so the federal tax on a generation-skipping transfer of wealth would apply only if the amount exceeded $5 million.\n\nThe GSTT truly applies to the very wealthy, however, because the transferred amount is significant. Most people will never encounter the GSTT because of the high threshold. The tax only applies when the transferred amount exceeds $13.99 million per individual for single taxpayers and $27.98 million for married couples filing jointly as of 2025. The exemption is the gift and estate tax lifetime exemption.\n\nGSTs still serve as\u00a0tools forhigh-net-worth individualsto transfer wealth at a lower tax rate even with\u00a0the installment of taxes on generation-skipping transfers. And they became even sharper tools on December 22,\u00a02017 when President Donald Trump signed theTax Cuts and Jobs Actinto effect during his first term which doubled the generation-skipping tax exemption.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) doubled the estate tax exemption to $11.18 million for singles and $22.36 million for married couples beginning on January 1, 2018 but only through 2025. The exemption level is indexed for inflation, meaning these numbers have increased each year. The 40% top tax rate remains in place.\n\nThis act expires on January 1, 2026 pushing the exemptions back to their pre-Act amounts unless Congress extends them.\n\nA generation-skipping trust reduces the amount of estate taxes when ultra-high net worth individuals (UHNWIs) pass down their wealth. Generation-skipping transfers go directly to grandchildren or great-grandchildren and are only taxed once instead of being taxed at each generation of inheritance,\n\nGeneration-skipping transfers are taxed at a flat 40% tax rate excluding the amounts covered by the generation-skipping transfer exemption.\n\nA generation-skipping trust is usuallyirrevocable. It can't be amended or dissolved after it's created. Irrevocable trusts can be dissolved through judicial action, however. This could happen if a judge determined that the trust was created fraudulently or that the grantor was not of sound mind at the time of its creation.\n\nA generation-skipping trust is a legal vehicle that allows wealthy individuals to reduce their tax burdens when they pass on their wealth. These trusts are taxed only once as they pass wealth on to grandchildren or other generation-skipping heirs instead of paying estate taxes with each generation. Estate taxes only affect fortunes in the tens of millions so a generation-skipping trust is generally only necessary for the truly wealthy.\n\nBratton Law Group. \"Passing Assets to Grandchildren Through a Generation-Skipping Trust.\"\n\nJournal of Accountancy. \"The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax: A Quick Guide.\"\n\nBuchanan. \"Change Continues: Federal Estate, Gift and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Changes to Exemption Amounts, Exclusion Amounts and More to Come?\"\n\nBuckley Law. \"What the New Tax Law Means to You and Your Clients.\"\n\nJ.P.
