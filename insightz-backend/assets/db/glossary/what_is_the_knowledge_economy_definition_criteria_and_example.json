  "definition": "In a knowledge economy, products and services are mainly based on knowledge-related activities, rather than physical assets and labor.\n\nThe knowledge economy is an economy of products and services produced with human capital\u2014knowledge, skills, and intellectual property\u2014rather than physical assets such as land and physical labor.\n\nIt refers to the ability to capitalize on scientific discoveries and applied research.\n\nThe knowledge economy represents a large share of the activity in most highlydeveloped economies.\n\nA significant component of its value might beintangible assets, such as the value of its workers' knowledge or of intellectual property such as patents and proprietary procedures.\n\nDeveloping economies tend to be heavily focused on agriculture and manufacturing, which involve physical resources.\n\nHighly developed countries have a larger share of service-related activities. The latter include knowledge-based economic activities such as research, technical support, and consulting.\n\nThe knowledge economy is the marketplace for the production and sale of scientific and engineering discoveries.\n\nThis knowledge can be commodified in the form ofpatentsor otherintellectual propertyprotections. The producers of this information, such as scientific experts, research labs, and technology developers, are also considered to be part of the knowledge economy.\n\nThe world economy has become more knowledge-based thanks to globalization, which can reveal the best practices of each country's economy.\n\nKnowledge-based factors also create an interconnected and global\u00a0economy where\u00a0human expertise and trade secrets are considered important economic assets and resources.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)don't allow companies to include these assets on their balance sheets, however.\n\nThe Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 was a major turning point in the treatment of intellectual property in the United States. It allowed universities to retain title to inventions or discoveries made with federal R&D funding and to negotiate exclusive licenses.\n\nThe knowledge economy reflects the way that education, knowledge, andhuman capitalcan serve as productive assets or business products to be sold and exported to yield profits for individuals, businesses, and the economy.\n\nThis component of the economy relies heavily on intellectual capabilities rather than on natural resources or physical contributions.\n\nProducts and services that result from intellectual expertise advance\u00a0technical and scientific fields in the knowledge economy. This encourages innovation in the economy as a whole.\n\nThe World Bank defines knowledge economies according to four pillars:\n\nThe modern commercialization of academic research and basic science has its roots in governments seeking military advantage.\n\nAcademic institutions,\u00a0companies engaging inresearch and development (R&D),\u00a0programmers developing software and search engines, and health\u00a0workers using digital data to improve treatments are all components of a knowledge economy.\n\nThey pass on the results of their efforts to workers in more traditional fields such as farmers who use software applications and digital solutions to manage their crops more effectively.\n\nThese fields also include advanced technological-based medical procedures such as robot-assistant surgeries and schools that provide digital study aids and online courses for their students.\n\nIt's difficult to gauge the value of the global knowledge economy because it's not a clearly defined category such as manufacturing. However, one market research firm valued the 2024 global intellectual property market alone at $11.6 billion, with a projected value of $27.74 billion by 2033.\n\nHigher education and technical training are obvious assets but communication and teamwork are also essential skills for a knowledge-based economy, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. It's unlikely that any single knowledge worker can generate groundbreaking innovations alone so these interpersonal and workplace competencies are essential for a knowledge-based economy to thrive.\n\nThe United Nations Development Program's Global Knowledge Index ranks knowledge economies by country. It scores each country based on \"enabling factors\" such as education levels, technical and vocational training, innovation, and communications technology. In 2024, Sweden was the top-ranked knowledge economy with a score of 68.3%. The second- to fifth-placed countries were Finland, Switzerland, Denmark, and The Netherlands, with scores of 68%, 67.9%, 66.8%, and 66.8%, respectively. The U.S. ranked seventh with a score of 66.2%.\n\nThe term \"knowledge economy\" describes the commercialization of intellectual pursuits.\n\nThis type of economy capitalizes on research and scientific discoveries. It\u2019s a significant component of highly developed economies. Intellectual property plays a significant role in a knowledge economy.\n\nUnfortunately, GAAP doesn\u2019t recognize these assets on companies\u2019 balance sheets so you won\u2019t be able to pinpoint ownership by researching financial statements.\n\nGovTrack. \"H.R. 6933 (96th): Government Patent Policy Act of 1980.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"The Knowledge Economy, The Kam Methodology, and World Bank Operations,\" Pages 5-8.\n\nBusiness Research Insights. \"Global Intellectual Property (IP) Valuation Market Size, Share, Growth, and Industry Analysis, by Type (Patent Valuation, Trademark Valuation & Copyright Valuation), by Application (Corporate, Research Institute & University), and Regional Forecast to 2033.\"\n\nOECD. \"Competencies for the Knowledge Economy,\" Page 1.\n\nKnoema. \"Global Knowledge Index.\"",
