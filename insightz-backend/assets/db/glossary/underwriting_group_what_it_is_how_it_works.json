  "term": "Underwriting Group: What It Is, How It Works",
  "definition": "An underwriting group is a temporary association ofinvestment bankersand broker-dealers who wish to purchase a new issue ofsecuritiesfrom an issuer in order to distribute the issue to investors at a profit. The underwriting group shares the risk and aids in the successful distribution of the new securities issue once the issuance goes public.\n\nAn underwriting group is also called a purchase group, a distributing syndicate, or a syndicate.\n\nAn underwriting group manages the distribution of a new securities issue, such as a single companystockor abond. The group buys the issuance from the firm first at a specified price and then sells it to the public (as opposed to a company selling the shares directly to investors.) Then, the underwriting group resells the issue to investors in order to make a profit.\n\nFor the issuing company, having an underwriting group means that they are paid upfront for the shares they are issuing. As a result, a significant amount of risk is removed from the issuing company and taken on by the underwriting group. The issuing company no longer has to sell the inventory of its stock directly to investors. The profit or loss for the group is determined by how the new stock performs on the market. (If there is a profit, it is the difference between the purchase price and the resale price.) This difference is also known as the underwriting spread.\n\nComing together temporarily as an underwriting group allows investment bankers and institutions\u00a0to finance a\u00a0high-volume purchase that would be out of reach for one banker or institution. However, once all the securities are sold off toinvestors, there is no reason for the group to exist anymore. At this point, an underwriting group disbands, and the individual bankers and financial entities are free to come together in underwriting groups for other, separate securities issues.\n\nIn an underwriting group, there is typically one lead underwriter. The lead underwriter is responsible for dealing with regulatory bodies. The lead underwriter may also receive the largest portion of the issue for distribution.\n\nUnderwritinghas applications in both investment banking and the insurance sector. However, it means different things in these distinct industries; an underwriting group is a different entity in investment banking than in insurance.\n\nIn investment banking, underwriting is the process of joining together with other financial entities to purchase large volumes of a new security that is being issued. After this, the shares are resold or distributed to investors. This process is\u00a0transactional; underwriting groups come together for a temporary amount of time to buy and then sell a specific security.\n\nIn the insurance industry, underwriting is the process of calculating risk andpayoutsand calculating the costs of purchasing insurance for different objects, situations, and entities. Insurance underwriting can be done by a group or an individual, and an underwriting group can exist over long periods of time and through multiple contracts and policies with a variety of policyholders. The main function of an insurance underwriting group is not to pool funds to purchase securities but to do calculations of risk and determine the correct rate for an insurance policy.",
