Mortgage loans are a type of secured loan therefore one commonality among all mortgage loans is the pledging of real estate collateral.\n\nIn a mortgage loan the mortgagor is the party receiving the loan and the mortgagee is the party offering the loan. The mortgagor must submit acredit applicationand agree to the mortgage loan terms if approved for a loan. The mortgagee has the authority to determine the terms of the mortgage loan, oversee the servicing of the loan and manage the title rights to the real estate collateral.\n\nSimilar to other types of loans in the credit market, the terms of a mortgage loan will be based on the borrower\u2019s credit application and the lenders underwriting standards.

However, different from other types of loans, a mortgage loan will also closely consider a borrower\u2019shousing expense ratio. Underwriters analyze these three components when assessing a mortgagor for mortgage loan approval. Lenders have varying standards for mortgage loan approvals. Generally traditional lenders will require a credit score of 620 or higher, a debt-to-income level of 36% and a housing expense ratio of 28%.Housing expenses included in the housing expense ratio can vary by lender with the key component being the mortgagor\u2019s monthly mortgage payment.\n\nMortgagors approved for a mortgage loan must agree to the terms offered by the mortgagee in order to complete the deal. A mortgage loan contract will include the mortgagor\u2019s interest rate and duration. The mortgagor is required to make monthly payments of principal and interest in order to keep the loan in good standing with the mortgagee.
