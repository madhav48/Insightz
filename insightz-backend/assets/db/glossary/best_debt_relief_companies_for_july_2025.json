  "definition": "Weindependently evaluateall of our recommendations. If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.\n\nInvestopedia\u2019s in-depth research into the best debt relief companies foundNational Debt Reliefto be the top overall choice for anyone seeking help from a debt settlement specialist, largely thanks to its relatively low fees. If you\u2019d like to start with credit counseling (a wise idea), our top-rated company is Apprisen.\n\nInvestopedia\u2019s research and editorial teams examined 40 debt relief companies (covering debt settlement and credit counseling) and collected over 2,000 data points to determine our best picks. We evaluated each company based on its fees, services, customer satisfaction, and other factors.\n\n\u201cDebt relief\u201d can refer to a variety of financial services, including debt settlement, credit counseling, bankruptcy, and debt consolidation. Our ranking here shows debt settlement firms and credit counseling services. Be aware that debt settlement will have severe negative consequences for your credit.\n\nLowest fees among the best debt settlement companies\n\nNationwide availability (except for four states)\n\nHighest-rated company that works with credit card debt\n\nResidents of Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia are not eligible\n\nSavings account fees are not provided\n\nWe picked National Debt Relief (NDR) as the best overall debt settlement company because it beat the competition in just about every respect. NDR will attempt to help you settle your outstanding debt for less than you owe; if it\u2019s successful, it charges 15% to 25% of thesettleddebt. NDR works with many common types of debt, including credit card balances, lines of credit, personal loans, collection accounts, and even business debts.\n\nYou\u2019ll need to be at least $10,000 in debt to work with National Debt Relief, which is a bit more than most companies we researched. NDR is accredited by two well-known names in the industry: the American Association of Debt Resolution (AADR) and the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators (IAPDA).\n\nNational Debt Relief has good customer reviews for the most part, too. It scored 4.7 out of 5 on Trustpilot, with over 42,000 reviews, and 4.7 on the Better Business Bureau (BBB) with over 5,000 reviews.But the company isn\u2019t transparent about the fees involved with the savings account that you\u2019ll need to open as part of the process, and those fees can add up quite a bit over the months it takes to resolve a debt settlement program. (You\u2019ll usually have to pay those fees with any debt settlement company.)\n\nNational Debt Relief was founded in 2009 and has headquarters in New York City.Read more in ourfull National Debt Relief review.\n\nBy law, debt relief companies can\u2019t charge upfront fees.So, you\u2019ll start with a free consultation to see if the program is a good fit. If you decide to move forward, you\u2019ll get a savings account to hold your settlement funds, which will likely have a setup and monthly fee.\n\nOther than that, you\u2019ll only be charged a fee if National Debt Relief is able to reach a settlement for any given debt and you agree to the terms. NDR will charge 15% to 25% of the settled debt\u2014it\u2019s a hefty fee, although the lower end is almost as low as any of the debt settlement companies we researched.\n\n$7,500 minimum debt requirement\n\nGreat customer ratings and reputation\n\nUnavailable in a handful of states and D.C.\n\nSavings account is somewhat expensive (but feesaredisclosed)\n\nConsumer protection law violations on record\n\nFreedom Debt Relief (FDR) has been in operation for over 20 years (founded in 2002), and in that time it claims to have helped over one million customers find relief from a total of $18 billion in debt.Despite its consumer protection law violations (settled in 2019), the company enjoys high customer satisfaction ratings.\n\nDebt relief companies have different minimum debt requirements\u2014some require as much as $10,000 before they'll work with you. But FDR only requires $7,500, making it one of the more accessible companies included in our research.\n\nFDR\u2019s Trustpilot rating is an \u201cExcellent\u201d 4.6, with over 45,000 reviews, and the BBB has it at 4.45.On Google Reviews it\u2019s a similar picture, with 4.6 stars.Overall, the company is almost as highly rated as our top pick for customer satisfaction.\n\nFreedom Debt Relief covers a wide variety of debts, from the common (credit card bills) to the less common (payday loans). Its service may be expensive because it charges based on your initial amount of debt, but FDR offers a program guarantee that limits the fees you\u2019ll pay.\n\nFreedom Debt Relief is based in San Mateo, California.Read our fullFreedom Debt Relief review.\n\nFreedom Debt Relief\u2019s program guarantee states that if your settlement cost is more than the amount of debt you enroll in the program, they\u2019ll \u201crefund you the difference from [their] collected fees, up to 100%.\u201dBe aware that debt settlement usually causes your outstanding balances to swell because you\u2019re instructed to stop making payments, and so you accrue late fees and interest charges. That means you may end up having more debt to deal with than expected.\n\nFreedom Debt Relief\u2019s program starts with a free consultation to go over your debt situation. If you decide to work with FDR, you\u2019ll open up a savings account with a separate bank. FDR is one of very few debt relief companies to mention how much this account costs\u2014in this case, there\u2019s a $9.95 setup fee and an ongoing $9.95 monthly charge.This is unfortunate, given that manysavings accountsare available for free, but this is par for the course if you hire a debt settlement company.\n\nIf Freedom Debt Settlement is able to negotiate a debt settlement with your creditors, you\u2019ll pay 15% to 25% of your initial enrolled debt.\n\nBest overall customer satisfaction score among best companies\n\nClaims to reduce debts by an average of 57%\n\nMinimum debt requirement of $10,000 is high\n\nFees are charged based on initial debt, rather than settled debt\n\nNot available in Maine, Oregon, and Iowa\n\nNew Era Debt Solutions has a higher debt minimum than many other debt relief companies, but it also has over 25 years of experience helping people settle their unsecured debts for less. And its fees are about as good as it gets (the high end of 23% is the lowest among all companies we researched).\n\nNew Era has great customer reviews, too. Trustpilot gives it 4.9 stars with over 400 reviews, and its BBB profile boasts 4.94 stars (but with about 50 reviews).Customers on Google Reviews rated it 4.9 stars, with over 220 reviews.The company has no complaints with the CFPB.\n\nNew Era Debt Solutions is based in California and was founded in 1998. Read our fullNew Era Debt Solutions review.\n\nAs usual, your experience with New Era starts with a free consultation. Then, if you think debt settlement and New Era are the right way for you to become debt-free, you\u2019ll get a savings account that may come with an initial and monthly fee. You\u2019ll make monthly payments into that account to fund your settlement offers.\n\nIf any of your debts are successfully settled, New Era will charge 14% to 23% of the initial amount of the debt.\n\nCustomer service available every day\n\nAccredited by three reputable agencies\n\nRequires at least $10,000 of debt\n\nSavings account fees are not disclosed\n\nUnavailable to residents in 11 states\n\nAccredited Debt Relief (a division of Beyond Finance) is our number one choice for customer service for a few reasons: It provides a variety of ways to get in touch with customer support, with great daily availability, and it has top-notch reviews from past customers.\n\nCustomer service is available by phone, email, and live web chat (web chat through its partner, Beyond Finance). Accredited Debt Relief has better availability than many other companies\u2014you can get in touch with them from 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. EST on weekdays, and 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. EST on weekends.Beyond Finance offers a mobile app (a rare feature), available for iPhone and Android, although it\u2019s not clear if customers of Accredited Debt Relief can use it.\n\nAccredited Debt Relief earned one of the highest overall customer satisfaction ratings among all of the debt settlement companies we researched. It has 4.8 stars on Trustpilot and 4.89 on the BBB, with thousands of reviews.It also holds a variety of accreditations: AADR, IAPDA, and Consumer Debt Relief Initiative (CDRI).\n\nUnlike many other companies, Accredited Debt Relief usually charges 25% for any debts it can successfully settle, rather than a range of fees. This can give you some peace of mind because you can more easily calculate your total costs, but it also means you might end up paying more than you otherwise would.\n\nAccredited Debt Relief was founded in 2011 and is based in Houston, Texas.Read our fullAccredited Debt Relief review.\n\nBe aware that Accredited Debt Relief (and some other debt settlement companies) often use confusing language on their websites. They may talk about \u201cdebt consolidation\u201d\u2014in some cases they can connect you with actualdebt consolidationloansfrom their partners, but at other times they\u2019re simply referring todebt settlement. These are very different, and it\u2019s important to be clear about what you\u2019re signing up for.\n\nAccredited Debt Relief\u2019s service begins with a free consultation. If you decide to pursue debt settlement to get out of debt faster, the company will negotiate with your creditors to attempt to settle your debts for less than you owe. You\u2019ll likely be charged fees for the associated savings account, in which you\u2019ll make deposits to build up your settlement fund.\n\nIf Accredited Debt Relief is able to negotiate a settlement and you agree to the terms, you\u2019ll be charged 25% of the settled debt.\n\nYou may also be offereddebt consolidation loansthrough Accredited Debt Relief\u2019s partners, but we don\u2019t usually recommend getting a loan this way. Instead, check with a variety of debt consolidation loan lenders to find the lowest rates you can get before making a decision.\n\nCounseling services for taxes, housing, student loans, and more\n\nSeveral customer support channels make it easy to get help\n\nWeekend customer support is not available\n\nSome counseling courses may not have much or any human interaction\n\nCertain counseling services have higher fees\n\nApprisen earned the top spot among credit counseling agencies, with great scores across the board. It has low fees, offers a wide variety of services, and has excellent (but limited) customer ratings.\n\nApprisen offers debt management plans, not debt settlement. Apprisen can negotiate with your creditors to figure out a payment plan and may be able to help get your interest rates reduced. But debt management plans require you to pay off the debt you owe\u2014there is no debt forgiveness involved, but that also means you won\u2019t have asettlement on your credit reportsbringing your credit score down. You\u2019ll make one monthly payment to Apprisen to cover all the creditors involved in your debt management plan until your debts are paid off.\n\nCredit counseling services charge fees based on income, and they usually have a maximum amount they\u2019ll charge.Apprisen may waive the enrollment and monthly fees entirely, depending on your financial situation, or it may charge up to $45 for each for DMPs.That\u2019s a bit less expensive than the average among credit counseling services we researched.\n\nApprisen also offers comprehensive counseling services to help with all kinds of debt problems, from housing to bankruptcy.\n\nApprisen was founded in 1955 and is headquartered in Gahanna, Ohio.Learn more in our fullApprisen credit counseling review.\n\nApprisen starts with a free financial review session. You\u2019ll speak with a counselor about your debt, and together you\u2019ll figure out which service would be most effective (and how much it\u2019ll cost). As mentioned, Apprisen\u2019s fees are reduced or waived entirely for those who qualify.\n\nIn addition to the paid counseling options above, Apprisen offers free counseling for the following situations and needs:\n\nLong-established business (since 1958)\n\nDebt management plan fees can be somewhat high\n\nAny amount of debt could be too much, but many debt relief companies have minimum debt requirements\u2014you might need $7,500 or as much as $10,000 in debt before they\u2019ll work with you. But Money Management International (MMI) has no minimum debt requirement to enroll in a debt management program, so you don\u2019t have to wait until the problem is that big before seeking help.\n\nMMI offersdebt management plans (DMPs)\u2014these are payment plans that can help you pay what you owe without major damage to your credit. Fees for debt management plans are on a sliding scale, based on income; enrollment fees can be as low as $0 or as high as $75, and monthly fees range from $0 to $59.MMI also provides help with housing issues, bankruptcy, disaster recovery, and more.\n\nMoney Management International offers superb customer service availability, with phone support open 24/7.Past customers agree that MMI provides a high-quality service, giving it 4.7 stars on Trustpilot and 4.89 on the BBB. Many reviewers praise the company\u2019s friendly, helpful credit counselors and efficient service.\n\nMoney Management International was founded in 1958 (the oldest among debt relief companies we researched) and is based in Stafford, Texas.Learn more in our full review ofMoney Management International.\n\nMoney Management International\u2019s program begins with a free initial consultation, which you can sign up for online or by calling the company. You\u2019ll discuss your financial situation with a debt counselor and explore some options. MMI\u2019s paid services are available on a sliding fee scale and include:\n\nMoney Management International also offers free support in these areas:\n\nOne of the only companies to help with tax debt\n\nAccreditations from the AADR and IAPDA\n\nFees based on amount of initial debt, rather than settled\n\nCuraDebt is our top-rated company with resources tohelp with tax debt; in fact, it\u2019s the only company to make our best list that works with tax debt. The company\u2019s website looks like a relic of the past, but it offers comprehensive debt settlement services that cover most debt problems people are likely to have.\n\nCuraDebt\u2019s fees are relatively low, so you shouldn\u2019t expect to be charged extra just because you\u2019re dealing with tax debt. Customer reviews are decent overall, but there aren\u2019t many of them to see\u2014the company has 4.9 stars on Trustpilot and 4.7 on the BBB, but with under 100 reviews across those sites.\n\nOne downside is CuraDebt\u2019s availability\u2014it\u2019s available in 41 states and D.C., although it can refer people to local law firms in most other states.\n\nCuraDebt was founded in 1996 and is based in Florida.Read more in our fullCuraDebt Debt Relief review.\n\nYou\u2019ll begin with a free consultation, as is the norm with debt settlement companies. If you decide to proceed with typical debt settlement, you\u2019ll stop making your regular monthly payments to creditors and instead make payments into a savings account\u2014this account will likely have fees, although these are not disclosed. The procedure for tax relief may be different.\n\nCuraDebt\u2019s customer support informed us that, if the company is able to settle any of your debts, you\u2019ll be charged 15% to 25% of theinitialamount of that debt. CuraDebt\u2019s website says that fees may vary by state and that it offers \u201cflat-fee pricing,\u201d although it\u2019s not clear what that means.\n\nLong-established company (founded in 2002)\n\nExcellent customer satisfaction ratings\n\nMinimum debt requirement of $10,000\n\nLimited service area\u201441 states and D.C.\n\nCustomer service support hours are limited\n\nPacific Debt Relief is only available in about half the country, but itsdebt settlement feesare just as low as our best overall pick, so it\u2019s worth a look if you live in an eligible state. You\u2019ll pay 15% to 25% of any debt that Pacific is able to settle; according to a customer support rep, the percentage you pay is based on the amount of settled debt. Unfortunately, like many companies, it doesn\u2019t disclose the fees for the savings account that will hold your settlement fund.\n\nPast customers are pleased with Pacific\u2019s debt settlement services, with very few exceptions. Raters on Trustpilot give it 4.7 stars, with nearly 2,000 reviews; most of the comments refer to professional, pleasant interactions with customer support.It\u2019s even better at the BBB, where Pacific has 4.9 stars and a similar number of reviews.\n\nPacific Debt Relief has been in business since 2002 and is based in San Diego, California.Learn more in our fullPacific Debt Relief review.\n\nPacific Debt Relief is available in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n\nAs usual, you begin with a free consultation with Pacific Debt Relief. If you decide to work with this company, you\u2019ll open a savings account, which may have initial and monthly fees. If Pacific is able to settle any of your debts and you agree to the terms, you\u2019ll pay 15% to 25% of the amount of settled debt.\n\nInvestopedia was founded in 1999 and has provided original recommendations on the best debt relief companies since June 2020. Investopedia\u2019s research and editorial teams collected over 2,000 data points on debt relief companies (including debt settlement and credit counseling services) to develop comprehensive, unbiased recommendations that serve people in a variety of circumstances.\n\nThere are many forms of debt relief, includingdebt settlementcompanies that work with creditors on your behalf to pay off your debts for less than what you owe. The fee for their services is usually a percentage of your settled debt. For example, if the fee is 15% and your settled debt is $2,000, your cost would be $300. Some companies might base their fees on your initial debt.\n\nHowever, yourcostsare not limited to that fee. You'll need to establish a savings account from which your debts will be paid off, and you will be responsible for the setup fee and any other fees associated with that account. The debt relief company will use the funds you add to that savings account to pay off your creditors.\n\nDebt settlement companies cannot charge you any fees until they have settled your debt, so they won't agree to work with you until after a consultation that determines their services are a good fit for your situation.\n\nDebt relief options may be worth considering for those who can't keep up with their monthly payments but still have enough income or cash on hand to settle their debts and pay the fees charged by a debt relief company.\n\nIt's also best for those who are prepared to handle the hit their credit scores will take. If creditors are settling your debts for less than what you initially owed, you should expect yourFICOscores to go down, whether you are working with a debt relief company or not.\n\nNonprofit credit counselors can provide free or low-cost advice for people struggling with debt. We recommendseeking credit counselingbefore agreeing to work with a debt settlement company. Credit counselors offer free initial consultations, and they can help you understand your debt and your options before committing to a debt relief plan.\n\nIf you are considering working with a debt relief company, you should familiarize yourself with these common terms:\n\nNational Debt Reliefis the highest-rated debt relief company, according to Investopedia's independent research. It offers debt settlement services across most of the country, for relatively low fees compared to other debt relief companies.\n\nDifferent debt relief options have different effects on your credit.Debt settlement\u2014paying off an account balance for less than you owe\u2014will cause quite a bit of damage to your credit, but it could be well worth the price of debt forgiveness. It'll stay on your credit reports for seven years, although the negative effect diminishes over time even before it drops off. Bankruptcy is similar, although your debt may be completely eliminated. Adebt management planthrough a credit counseling agency has no direct effect on your credit.\n\nThe main downsides of debt relief programs are their costs and their effects on your credit. Debt settlement, for example, requires you to pay some portion of the debt; if you work with adebt settlement company, you'll also be charged a hefty fee based on the amount of debt involved. Debt settlement requires you to become delinquent on your debts, which is bad for your credit, and then debt settlement itself has a negative effect.\n\nThe right option for you depends on your situation. If your debts are fairly manageable and you have decent credit,debt consolidationmay provide some relief by lowering your total monthly payment and maybe your APR. If your debts are more overwhelming, debt relief through debt settlement orbankruptcymay be required. We recommendspeaking with a credit counselor(for free) to better understand your situation and your best options.\n\nYes, in general it does make sense to pay off credit card debt first because credit cards tend to have some of the highest interest rates among types of debt. This fits with thedebt avalanche methodof debt repayment, in which you make the minimum payment on all your debts and then allocate any extra money toward the debt with the highest interest rate. This helps you save the most money on interest over time.\n\nCompared to other types of debt, paying off student loans usually isn't a priority. This is because student loans tend to have relatively low interest rates, so they're not as expensive to hold as other types of debt, like credit cards and personal loans. But, if you have somemoney in savingsand some cash to spare, it generally makes sense to pay extra toward your student loans to pay them off faster and save on interest.\n\nThe Investopedia research and editorial teams researched the debt relief industry by collecting information directly from company websites and representatives, analyzing consumer sentiment, and conducting a competitive analysis. Investopedia researched 40 debt relief companies (offering either debt settlement, credit counseling, or both).\n\nInvestopedia ranked each company across 53 criteria, broken down into the following categories for debt settlement companies:\n\nThe following category weights were used to rank credit counseling services:\n\nData was collected from Oct. 19, 2023, to Dec. 18, 2023. Investopedia gathered over 2,000 original data points to score and rank debt relief companies and provide the best possible recommendations for consumers with overwhelming debt.\n\nRead ourfull methodologyto learn more about how we determined the best debt relief companies.\n\nInternational Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators. \u201cNational Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nAmerican Association of Debt Resolution. \u201cNational Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \"National Debt Relief, LLC.\"\n\nTrustpilot. \"National Debt Relief.\"\n\nLinkedIn. \"National Debt Relief.\"\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"Debt Relief Companies Prohibited From Collecting Advance Fees Under FTC Rule That Takes Effect October 27, 2010.\"\n\nFreedom Debt Relief. \"Why Choose Freedom Debt Relief.\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Settles Lawsuit Against Freedom Debt Relief.\"\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \u201cFreedom Debt Relief, LLC.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot. \"Freedom Debt Relief.\"\n\nGoogle Reviews. \"Freedom Debt Relief.\"\n\nLinkedIn. \"Freedom Debt Relief.\"\n\nFreedom Debt Relief. \u201cFrequently Asked Questions,\u201d Select When Does Freedom Debt Relief Collect Customer Fees.\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \"New Era Debt Solutions.\"\n\nTrustpilot. \"New Era Debt Solutions.\"\n\nGoogle Reviews. \u201cNew Era Debt Solutions.\u201d\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Consumer Complaint Database \u2014 New Era Debt Solutions.\"\n\nNew Era Debt Solutions. \u201cExtraordinary Value.\u201d\n\nAccredited Debt Relief. \"Contact Us.\"\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \u201cAccredited Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nTrustpilot. \"Accredited Debt Relief.\"\n\nInternational Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators. \u201cBeyond Finance.\u201d\n\nAmerican Association of Debt Resolution. \u201cBeyond Accredited Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nLinkedIn. \u201cAccredited Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \"Apprisen.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Justice. \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) - Credit Counseling.\"\n\nApprisen. \"Debt Management Program.\"\n\nApprisen. \"Apprisen\u2019s 60 Years of Success Through Service.\"\n\nApprisen. \u201cCredit Health Education.\u201d\n\nApprisen. \u201cFinancial Coaching.\u201d\n\nApprisen. \u201dFinancial Health Plan.\u201d\n\nApprisen. \u201cBankruptcy Counseling.\u201d\n\nApprisen. \u201cHousing Counseling.\u201d\n\nMoney Management International. \u201cDebt Management Plan FAQs,\u201d Select Are there fees associated with a DMP?\n\nMoney Management International. \"Locations.\"\n\nTrustpilot. \"Money Management International.\"\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \"Money Management International Inc.\"\n\nLinkedIn. \"Money Management International.\"\n\nMoney Management International. \"Debt Management Plans.\"\n\nMoney Management International. \u201cWho Needs Bankruptcy Counseling and Education?\u201d\n\nMoney Management International. \u201cReverse Mortgage Counseling.\u201d\n\nMoney Management International. \u201cHomebuyer Counseling and Education.\u201d\n\nMoney Management International. \u201cCredit Report Review and Counseling.\u201d\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \"CuraDebt Systems, LLC.\"\n\nLinkedIn. \"CuraDebt Debt Relief.\"\n\nTrustpilot. \"Pacific Debt Relief.\"\n\nBetter Business Bureau. \u201cPacific Debt Relief.\u201d\n\nLinkedIn. \"Pacific Debt Relief.\"\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \u201cHow To Get Out of Debt.\u201d",
