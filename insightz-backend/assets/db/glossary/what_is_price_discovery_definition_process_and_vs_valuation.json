  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nPrice discovery is the process conducted between buyers and sellers, whether explicit or inferred, of setting thespot priceor the fair price of any asset that is being traded. It includes evaluating tangible and intangible factors includingsupply and demand,\u00a0investor risk attitudes, and the overall economic and geopolitical environment.\n\nSimply put, price discovery is the point at which a buyer and a seller agree on a price and a transaction occurs.\n\nThe balance between buyers and sellers is a key factor in price discovery. The law of supply and demand is the main factor driving price.\n\nAt its core, price discovery involves finding where supply and demand meet.\n\nIn economics terms, thesupply curveand thedemand curveintersect at a single price, which then allows a transaction to occur. The shape of those curves is subject to many factors, from the size of the transaction to background conditions of previous or future scarcity or abundance. Location, storage,transaction costs, and psychology also play a role.\n\nThere is no specific formula using all these factors as variables. Indeed, the formula is a dynamic process that can change frequently, if not from trade to trade.\n\nWhile the term itself is relatively new, price discovery has been around for millennia as a process. Ancient souqs in the Middle East and marketplaces in Europe, the Indian subcontinent, and China brought together traders and buyers to establish acceptable prices of goods.\n\nIn modern times, derivatives traders in the pits of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) used hand signals and verbal cues to signal prices for a given commodity.\n\nElectronic trading has replaced most of the manual processes with mixed results. While it has significantly increased trading volumes and liquidity, electronic trading has also resulted in more volatility and less transparency about large positions.\n\nPrice discovery is the central function in any marketplace, whether it is a financialexchangeor a local farmer's market. The market brings potential buyers andsellerstogether, with members of each side having very different reasons for trading and varying styles for doing so.\n\nBy bringing buyers and sellers together, marketplaces allow the interested parties to interact, and by doing so a consensus price is established. Whether they're consciously aware of it or not, all the players do it again to set the very next price, and so on.\n\nPrice discovery is influenced by a wide variety of factors. Among these factors are the stage of market development, its structure, security type, and information available in the market.\n\nThose parties with the freshest or highest quality information have an advantage as they can act before others get that information. When new information arrives, it changes both the current and future condition of themarketfor that asset and therefore can change the price at which both sides are willing to trade.\n\nToo much transparency in information can be detrimental to a market because it increases the risks for traders moving large or significant positions.\n\nPrice discovery is not the same asvaluation. Price discovery is a market-driven interactive process, while valuation is a model-driven mechanism. Valuation is thepresent valueof presumedcash flowsof an asset, based on many factors including interest rates, competitive analysis, and technological changes both in place and envisioned.\n\nOther names for valuation of an asset arefair valueandintrinsic value. By comparing market value to valuation, analysts can conclude whether an asset is overpriced or underpriced by the market.\n\nThemarket priceis considered the correct price, but any differences can provide trading opportunities if and when the market price adjusts to include any information in the valuation models not previously considered.\n\nPrice discovery has to be transparent in order to work correctly for both buyers and sellers. Consider the traditional auction process. If a bidder did not know what prices were being offered by other buyers, it would be impossible to establish a fair price for any participant.\n\nValuation comes first. A buyer or seller determines an acceptable price, or price range, for an asset based on many factors. In fundamental stock analysis, for example, this includes looking at a company's earnings history, its competition, its management, and the product plans it has in the pipeline. That gives the buyer a way to project a stock's potential growth and set a fair price or price range for it. The buyer only then is ready to enter the interactive process of price discovery.\n\nWhether you're aware of it or not, you're using price discovery every time you buy or sell a stock or other asset. The current quote is either acceptable or unacceptable to you as a buyer or seller. If it's unacceptable, you wait until it changes.\n\nPrice discovery is an integral part of the process of buying and selling in a stock market, or in any marketplace. It's the point at which a buyer and a seller agree on a price that is acceptable to both parties.\n\nIG. \"What is price discovery and how does it work?\"",
