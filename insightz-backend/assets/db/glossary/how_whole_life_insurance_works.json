  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nWhole life insurance policies allow owners to borrow or withdraw the cash value.\n\nWhole life insurance provides coverage throughout the life of the insured person. In addition to paying a tax-free death benefit, whole life insurance includes a savings component in which cash value may accumulate. Interest accrues on a tax-deferred basis.\n\nWhole life insurance policies are one of several types of permanent life insurance. Universal life, indexed universal life, and variable universal life are others.\n\nWhole life insurance guarantees payment of adeath benefitto beneficiaries in exchange for level, regularly-due premium payments. The policy includes a savings portion, called the \u201ccash value,\u201d alongside the death benefit. In the savings component, interest may accumulate on a tax-deferred basis.Growing cash value is an essential component of whole life insurance.\n\nTo build cash value, a policyholder can often remit payments greater than the scheduled premium to purchase extra coverage (known aspaid-up additionsor PUA). Policy dividends can also be reinvested into the cash value and earn interest. Over time, the dividends and interest earned on the policy's cash value will provide a positive return to investors, growing larger than the total amount of premiums paid into the policy.\n\nThe cash value offers aliving benefit to the policyholder, meaning the policyholder can access it while the insured is still alive. To access cash reserves, the policyholder requests a withdrawal of funds or a loan. Withdrawals are tax-free up to the value of the total premiums paid.\n\nInterest is charged onpolicy loanswith rates varying per insurer, but the rates are generally lower than you\u2019d get with a personal loan or home equity loan.\n\nHowever, withdrawals and unpaid loans also reduce the cash value of the policy. Depending on the policy type and the size of its remaining cash value, a withdrawal could chip away at the death benefit or even wipe it out entirely.\n\nWhole life insurance is different fromterm life insurance, which only provides coverage for a certain number of years, rather than a lifetime. Term life does not have a cash savings component and only pays out a death benefit.\n\nA cash value life insurance policy is similar to a retirement savings account in that it allows investments to accumulate tax-deferred interest.\n\nPart of each premium payment goes toward the policy's cash value, which can be withdrawn orborrowed againstlater in life. The cash value of a life insurance policy grows quickly when the insured is young. But because more of the premium is needed to cover the cost of insurance as the insured ages, the cash value grows more slowly as they get older due to the higher risks associated with age.\n\nThe insured can access their policy\u2019s cash value by borrowing against it the cash value or bywithdrawing moneyin a partial cash surrender. Surrenders will reduce the final death benefit of your policy.\n\nYou can also use the cash value to cover your monthly premium payments instead of paying out of pocket. Or you can surrender the whole policy to receive the entire available cash value (minus anysurrender fees). However, the policy will be terminated and the death benefit will no longer be available to your beneficiaries.\n\nSome companies in the U.K. and Australia offerinsurance bondswith their policies, which provide some tax advantages.\n\nThe dollar amount of the death benefit is typically specified in the policy contract. But it can be changed in some instances.\n\nSome policies are eligible fordividend payments, and the policyholder may elect to use the dividends to buy paid-up additions to the policy, which will increase theamount paid at the time of death.\n\nDeath proceeds are non-taxable to the beneficiary.\n\nThe death benefit can also be affected by certain policy provisions or events. As mentioned before, unpaid policy loans (including accrued interest) reduce the death benefit dollar for dollar.\n\nAlternatively, many insurers offer voluntaryriders\u2014for a fee\u2014that secure or guarantee coverage, including the stated death benefit. Two of the most common such riders are the accidental death benefit and waiver of premium riders, which protect the death benefit if the insured becomesdisabledor critically or terminally ill and is unable to remit premiums due.\n\nBeneficiaries may also have decisions to make about how the death benefit is paid. The default option is to receive a lump-sum payment. But some policies also allow beneficiaries to choose to get the death benefit in installments, or to convert it to an annuity. An annuity may pay out for a set amount of time until the death benefit is exhausted, or it could pay out for the life of the beneficiary. The death benefit continues to earn interest until it is paid, and that interest may be taxable.\n\nAs is the case with any kind of permanent policy, it's important to thoroughly research all insurers being considered to ensure they're among the best whole life insurance companies currently operating.\n\nAs with any kind of life insurance, a whole life insurance policy gives individuals and their families financial security against the loss of a breadwinner. For families that rely on the income of a single person, a whole life policy can provide financial security against the sudden loss of an income provider.\n\nBut unlike term life, whole life can also be used as an investment. Once the cash value has grown big enough, you may be able to withdraw or borrow from it to pay for large purchases such as a home. Some people also use whole life cash value to supplement their income in retirement when markets are low.\n\nWhole life insurance is also useful for businesses as a contingency plan for the loss of a key employee or partner. If a key employee passes away, a whole life policy can provide a financial offset to the loss of their skills or expertise. If the deceased is part owner of the company, a whole life policy can provide the remaining owners with enough capital to buy out the deceased partner's share of the business.\n\nThere are several main types of whole life insurance, categorized based on how premiums are paid.\n\nWhole life insurance policies are further distinguished as participating and non-participating plans. With a non-participating policy, any excess of premiums over payouts becomes profit for the insurer. However, the insurer also assumes the risk of losing money.\n\nWith aparticipating policy, any excess of premiums is redistributed to the insured as a dividend. This dividend can then be used to make payments or increase one's policy coverage limits. However, dividends are not guaranteed and often vary each year, as they are primarily based on the company\u2019s financial performance.\n\nWhole life insurance is similar to term life insurance, in that both types of policies offer a payout upon the death of the insured. However, there are important differences. While whole life insurance offers a guaranteed death benefit for the entire lifetime of the insured, a term policy only pays out if the insured dies within a certain time frame\u2014usually 10, 20, or 30 years.\n\nThere are other considerations as well. In order to provide greater benefits, a whole life policy requires significantly higher premiums than a term policy with the same coverage limit. Whole life premiums are typically fixed throughout the policy duration, while term rates increase at each renewal as the insured grows older.\n\nCash value you can use for loans, withdrawals, or premium payments\n\nGuaranteed death benefit amount\n\nCash value may grow slower than with other policies\n\nNo flexibility to adjust the premium\n\nLimited ability to adjust the death benefit\n\nOn average, whole life insurance policies are significantly more expensive than term life insurance. Investopedia research using Quotacy found that the average monthly premium for a $500,000 whole life insurance policy ranges from $247 for a 30-year old female to $887 for a 60-year male.\n\nIn contrast, monthly premiums for term life insurance range from $25 for a 30-year-old female to $241 for a 55-year-old male for the same amount of coverage.\n\nUniversal life insurance and whole life insuranceare types of permanent life insurance that offer guaranteed death benefits for the life of the insured. However, a universal life policy allows the policyholder to adjust the death benefit as well as the premiums. Higher death benefits require higher premiums. Whole life insurance, on the other hand, does not allow for changes to the death benefit or premiums, which are set upon issue.\n\nThe cost of whole life insurance varies based on several factors, such as age, occupation, and health history. Older applicants typically have higher rates than younger applicants. People with a stellar health history normally receive\u00a0better rates than those with a history of health challenges. The face amount of coverage also determines how much a policyholder will pay; the higher the face amount, the higher the premium. Also, certain companies have higher rates than others, independent of the applicant and their risk profile. It's also worth noting that for the same amount of coverage, whole life insurance is far more expensive than term life insurance.\n\nModified whole life insurance is permanent life insurance in which premiums increase after a specific period. Policyowners pay lower premiums than they would for a level premium policy during the first few years, and higher premiums in the later years. Traditional whole life insurance premiums, in contrast, remain the same throughout the life of the policy.\n\nWhole life insurance generally has a level premium and death benefit, and provides a guaranteed benefit upon the death of the insured, regardless of when they die. Part of the premiums you pay for a whole life policy go to a savings component known as the cash value. Those funds are invested with a guaranteed return, and after they\u2019ve grown big enough, you can borrow from or withdraw from the cash value, tax-free.\n\nThis and the fact that whole life covers you until death (as long as you pay your premiums) offer clear advantages over term life insurance, which only pays out if the death occurs within a specific time frame. However, whole life insurance also has significantly higher costs.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\" Page 23.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Life Insurance & Disability Insurance Proceeds.\" Select \"Do I report proceeds paid under a life insurance contract as taxable income?\"\n\nGuardian. \u201cCan I Withdraw Cash from My Life Insurance Policy?\u201d",
