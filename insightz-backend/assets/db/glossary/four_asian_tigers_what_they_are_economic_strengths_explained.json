  "definition": "The Four Asian Tigers are the high-growth economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Fueled by exports andrapid industrialization, the Four Asian Tigers have consistently maintained high levels of economic growth since the 1960s,\u00a0and have\u00a0collectively joined the ranks of the world's wealthiest nations.\n\nHong Kong and Singapore are among the most prominent worldwide financial centers, while South Korea and Taiwan are essential hubs for\u00a0the global manufacturing of\u00a0automobile and electronic components, as well as information technology.\n\nAlso known as\u00a0the Asian Dragons,\u00a0the countries that make up the Four Asian Tigers share common characteristics, including a sharp focus on exports, an educated populace, and high savings rates. The economies of the Four Tigers have proven resilient enough to withstand local crises such as theAsian financial crisisof 1997 and\u00a0global shocks\u00a0like thecredit crunchof 2008.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund\u00a0includes the Four Asian Tigers in its category of 35 most advanced economies.\n\nIn the 1960s, South Korea's per capita gross domestic product was comparable to the poorest countries in\u00a0Asia and Africa. But in the four decades since then,\u00a0the country has observed substantial growth, affected in part by a system of close government, directed credit, and import restrictions.As of April 2023, South Korea had\u00a0a total GDP of $1.72\u00a0trillion\u00a0and a per capita GDP of $33,390 with a growth rate of 1.5% and a population of 51.6 million.\n\nDespite its contentious relationship with China, Taiwan has thrived over the last four decades. As of April 2023, Taiwan's GDP per capita was $33,910. Due to pressure from China, the country is not a part of the United Nations, but it has nevertheless emerged as a reliable exporter. Its GDP was $790.73 billion with a growth rate of 2.1%, making this nation of 23.3 million\u00a0people one of the strongest economies in Asia.\n\nHong Kong is considered\u00a0a special administrative region (SAR) in China, which gives it freedom over all its activities except for its defense until the year 2047, at which timeHong Kongand China will reassess their relationship.The latest reports show that the region ranks exceptionally\u00a0high on scales measuring economic freedom, boasting a\u00a0GDP of approximately $383 billion\u00a0as of April 2023,\u00a0a GDP per capita of $52,430, a growth rate of 3.5%, and a population of 7.3 million.\n\nAlthough it has only 5.7\u00a0million citizens, Singapore had\u00a0a GDP of $515.6 billion, a GDP per capita of $91,100 as of April 2023,\u00a0and a growth rate of 1.5%.Considered one of the least corrupt nations in the world, Singapore has a notoriously transparent regulatory environment and well-secured property rights, which provide valuable commercial security to its private sector.\n\nMalaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, and Indonesia are sometimes referred to as the \"Tiger Cub Economies,\" because while they have developed more slowly than the Four Asian Tigers in the decades since the 1950s, they havenonetheless grown at a steady rate.\n\nJSTOR Daily. \u201cEconomic Grrrowth in the East: Asian Tiger Economies.\u201d\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \u201cSouth Korea - Country Commercial Guide.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Korea, Republic of.\"\n\nU.S. Department of State. \u201cSupporting Taiwan\u2019s Participation in the UN System.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cTaiwan Province of China.\u201d\n\nThe Yale Review of International Studies. \u201cThe National Security Law, 'One Country Two Systems,' and Hong Kong\u2019s National Security Apparatus: The Coup De Grace to Hong Kong\u2019s Ideological Independence and Democratic Autonomy.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cHong Kong SAR.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Singapore.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of State. \u201c2022 Investment Climate Statements: Singapore.\u201d\n\nNew Perspectives on Global & European Dynamics. \u201cWhy the EU Should Pay More Attention to Indonesia.\u201d",
