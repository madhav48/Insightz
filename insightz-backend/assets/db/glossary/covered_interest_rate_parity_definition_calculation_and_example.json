  "definition": "Kateryna Onyshchuk / Getty Images\n\nCovered interest rate parity refers to a theoretical condition in which the relationship between interest rates and thespotandforwardcurrency values of two countries are in equilibrium. The covered interest rate parity situation means there is no opportunity for arbitrage\u00a0using forward contracts, which often exists between countries with different interest rates.\n\nCovered interest rate parity (CIP) can be compared withuncovered interest rate parity(UIP).\n\nThe formula for CIRP is most commonly expressed as follows to determine the forward foreign exchange rate:\n\nF=S\u00d7(1+id)(1+if)where:F=The\u00a0forward\u00a0foreign\u00a0exchange\u00a0rateS=The\u00a0current\u00a0spot\u00a0exchange\u00a0rateid=The\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0domestic\u00a0currencyor\u00a0the\u00a0base\u00a0currencyif=The\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0foreign\u00a0currencyor\u00a0the\u00a0quoted\u00a0currency\\begin{aligned}&F=S\\times\\frac{(1+i_d)}{(1+i_f)}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&F=\\text{The forward foreign exchange rate}\\\\&S=\\text{The current spot exchange rate}\\\\&i_d=\\text{The interest rate in the domestic currency}\\\\&\\qquad\\text{ or the base currency}\\\\&i_f=\\text{The interest rate in the foreign currency}\\\\&\\qquad\\text{ or the quoted currency}\\end{aligned}\u200bF=S\u00d7(1+if\u200b)(1+id\u200b)\u200bwhere:F=The\u00a0forward\u00a0foreign\u00a0exchange\u00a0rateS=The\u00a0current\u00a0spot\u00a0exchange\u00a0rateid\u200b=The\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0domestic\u00a0currencyor\u00a0the\u00a0base\u00a0currencyif\u200b=The\u00a0interest\u00a0rate\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0foreign\u00a0currencyor\u00a0the\u00a0quoted\u00a0currency\u200b\n\nUnder normal circumstances, a currency that offers lower interest rates tends to trade at a forward foreignexchange rate premiumin relation to another currency offering higher interest rates.\n\nThere are several different ways to calculate the forward foreign exchange rate, but the most common method is used here.\n\nCovered interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition that could be used in the foreign exchange markets to determine the forward foreign exchange rate. The condition also states that investors could hedge foreign exchange risk or unforeseen fluctuations in exchange rates (withforward contracts).\n\nConsequently, the foreign exchange risk is said to be covered. Interest rate parity may occur for a period, but that does not mean it will remain because interest rates and currency rates change over time.\n\nAs an example, assume Country X's currency is tradingat parwith Country Z's currency, but the annual interest rate in Country X is 6% and the interest rate in country Z is 3%. All other things being equal, it would make sense to borrow in the currency of Z, convert it in the spot market to currency X, and invest the proceeds in Country X.\n\nHowever, to repay the loan in currency Z, one must enter into a forward contract to exchange the currency back from X to Z. Covered interest rate parity exists when the forward rate of converting X to Z eradicates all the profit from the transaction.\n\nSince the currencies are trading at par, one unit of Country X's currency is equivalent to one unit of Country Z's currency. Assume that the domestic currency is Country Z's currency. Therefore, the forward price is equivalent to 0.97, or 1 x [ ( 1 + 3% ) / ( 1 + 6% ) ].\n\nLooking at the currency markets, we can apply the forward foreign exchange rate formula to figure out what theGBP/USDrate might be. Say the spot rate for the pair was trading at 1.35. Also, assume that the interest rate (using the prime lending rate) for the U.S. was 1.1% and 3.25% for the U.K. The domestic currency is the British pound, making the forward rate 1.38, calculated by: 1.35 x [ ( 1 + 0.0325)/( 1 + 0.011 ) ].\n\nCovered interest parity involves using forward contracts to cover the exchange rate. Meanwhile, uncovered interest rate parity involves forecasting rates and not covering exposure to foreign exchange risk\u2014that is, there are no forward rate contracts, and it uses only the expected spot rate. There is no difference between covered and uncovered interest rate parity when the forward and expected spot rates are the same.\n\nInterest rate parity says there is no opportunity for interest rate arbitrage for investors of two different countries. But this requires perfect substitutability and the free flow of capital. Sometimes there are arbitrage opportunities. This comes when the borrowing and lending rates are different, allowing investors to capture riskless yield.\n\nFor example, the covered interest rate parity fell apart during the Great Financial Crisis. However, the effort involved in capturing this yield usually makes it non-advantageous to pursue.\n\nThe covered interest rate parity is a theoretical occurrence where a pair's spot and forward currency prices are equal, representing no arbitrage opportunity.\n\nThe two types are covered and uncovered. The difference is that the covered type uses forward or futures contracts, while the uncovered uses expected spot rates.\n\nInterest rate parity does not hold when the spot and forward prices are not in equilibrium, representing an arbitrage opportunity.\n\nCovered interest rate parity is a condition where a currency pair's spot and forward prices are equal. It is used by currency traders to help them make decisions on arbitrage opportunities.\n\nCorrection\u2014Oct. 22, 2024: This article has been corrected to show the accurate formula for calculating the forward rate in the example.\n\nCME Group. \"Covered Interest Parity, Implied Forward FX Swaps, Cross Currency Basis, and CME \u20acSTR Futures.\"",
