  "term": "What Does It Mean to Be Tax-Exempt or Have Tax-Exempt Income?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nTax-exempt refers to income or transactions that are free from tax at the federal, state, or local level. The reporting of tax-free items may be on a taxpayer's individual or business\u00a0tax return and shown for informational purposes only. The tax-exempt article is not part of any tax calculations.\n\nTax-exempt may also refer to the status of a business or organization which has limits on the amount of income or gifts which\u00a0are\u00a0taxable. These organizations include religious and charitable institutions.\n\nNot to be confused with atax deduction, tax exemption frees the taxpayer of any tax obligation to submit taxes on the tax-free transaction or income. Whereas the use of a tax deduction is to reduce\u00a0the tax obligation by lowering gross income.\n\nOne common type oftax-exempt incomeis interest earned on municipal bonds, which are issued by states and cities to raise funds for operations or specific projects.\u00a0When a taxpayer makes interest income on municipal bonds issued in their state of residence, the profit is exempt from both federal and state taxes.\n\nTaxpayers receive IRS Form1099-INTfor any investment interest they earn\u00a0during the tax year.The reporting of tax-exempt interest is in box 8 of the 1099 form. This information is only for data purposes and is not included in the calculation of personal income taxes..\n\nA range of income types may be tax-exempt based on your specific situation. Tax rules may evolve and change, so when crafting your personal tax strategy, consult with a tax preparer to best understand the latest information and the widest scope on other tax-exempt income.\n\nHere are some additional common sources of tax-exempt income (this list is not exhaustive):\n\nA taxpayer may buy an asset and later sell it for a profit. The profit is a capital gain, which creates a taxable event. However, several types of capital gains are exempt from taxation.\n\nA taxpayer can offsetcapital gainswith othercapital lossesfor the tax year. For example, an investor with $5,000 in profits and $3,000 in losses pays taxes on only $2,000 in capital gains. The amount of capital losses a taxpayer may claim in a given year has a cap of $3,000. When capital losses exceed this cap, the excess may be carried forward to offset gains in future years.\n\nThe tax code also allows taxpayers to exclude from federal taxes a specific portion of capital gains from the sale of a home.\n\nThealternative minimum tax (AMT)is an alternative method for determining tax liability. AMT adds back specific tax-exempt items into the personal tax calculation. For example, interest from private activity bonds exempt from regular tax is added to the AMT tax calculation. Individual taxpayers must include the AMT calculation with their originaltax returnand pay tax on the higher tax liability.\n\nAn\u00a0exempt organization\u00a0that has $1,000 or more ofgross\u00a0incomefrom an\u00a0unrelated business\u00a0must file Form 990-T. An\u00a0organization\u00a0must pay an estimated\u00a0tax\u00a0if it expects its\u00a0tax\u00a0for the year to be $500 or more.\n\nA501(c)(3)nonprofit corporation\u00a0is a charitable organization that the IRS recognizes as tax-exempt. This type of organization does not pay income tax on its earnings or on the donations it receives. Donations made to such organizations may reduce a taxpayer's taxable income. This incentive encourages private charity and facilitates fundraising for nonprofits.\n\nTo gain the exemption, an organization must demonstrate how the exemption will serve the public and provide a benefit to a community.\n\nAn entity can become tax-exempt by meeting the requirements set forth by the IRS. There are severalcategories of tax-exempt statusfor charitable, religious, educational, and scientific organizations. The type of tax-exempt status needed will depend on the nature of the organization's activities.\n\nThe organization must be formed as a legal entity, and the organization must obtain anEINfrom the IRS. With this EIN, the organization is able to file an application with the IRS to obtain tax-exempt status. The most common form is Form 1023 for 501(c)(3) organizations. The application must provide detailed information about the organization's activities, governance, finances, and other relevant information.\n\nTheIRSwill review the application and make a determination about the organization's tax-exempt status. The process can take several months, and the IRS may request additional information or clarification during the review process.\n\nOnce granted tax-exempt status, the organization must comply with IRS rules, file annual returns, and meet other operational requirements.\n\nAlthough often used interchangeably, there are notable differences betweentax-exempt organizationand a nonprofit organization.\n\nA nonprofit organization is a type of entity that is organized for a specific purpose. Nonprofits can be structured in a variety of ways such as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association. Nonprofits are not required to pay federal income taxes on their earnings.\n\nA tax-exempt entity, on the other hand, is an organization that has been granted exemption from federal income tax by the IRS. Though this includes most nonprofit organizations, not all nonprofits are automatically tax-exempt. A nonprofit must apply and be approved by the IRS to gain tax-exempt status.\n\nThere are limitations associated with obtaining tax-exempt status. Tax-exempt organizations, particularly those classified as 501(c)(3) organizations, are subject to strict limitations and reporting requirements when engaging in political activities. This includes endorsing or opposing political candidates, contributing funds topolitical campaigns, and engaging in partisan activities.\n\nTax-exempt entities must adhere to regulations regarding transactions with insiders such as board members, officers, and key employees. These regulations are designed to prevent conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and private inurement, where individuals in positions of authority benefit personally from the organization's resources. Engaging in prohibited transactions can result in penalties, fines, or loss of tax-exempt status.\n\nAdditionally, tax-exempt organizations are generally prohibited from distributing profits or assets to individuals or shareholders. Any excess funds must be used for the organization's tax-exempt purpose. Though this restriction ensures that the organization's resources are dedicated to its tax-exempt purpose, it puts an onus on the entity to disburse funds for a specific purpose. The tax-exempt entity risks jeopardizing future funding from donors or grantors if disbursement is slow.\n\nA 501(c)(3) is a tax-exempt organization recognized by the IRS. However, there are other forms of organization an entity can file for and be awarded that are also tax-exempt. Therefore, while a 501(c) is tax-exempt, not all tax-exempt organizations are 501(c)(3) organizations.\n\nAdministering tax-exempt status involves additional reporting requirements. To become and maintain its status, an organization must meet ongoing filing and operational criteria. These requirements can create a burden in terms of time and labor. Outside of reporting and filing requirements, however, there are few significant downsides to being tax-exempt.\n\nNonprofit organizations are exempt from taxes because they serve public or private interests. Since they benefit the community, the IRS grants them tax-exempt status, under the understanding that any collected taxes would be used for similar purposes.\n\nYes, tax-exempt organizations such as nonprofits are often encouraged and expected to make money or earn more money than what they spend. For the financial health and longevity of the organization, theseentities must build reservesand have excess cash reside in bank accounts. The purpose of being tax-exempt is to have this net profit not be taxed by the IRS.\n\nA tax-exempt organization is recognized by the IRS as exempt from payingfederal income taxeson its earnings. To be considered tax-exempt, an organization must meet certain IRS requirements and apply for tax-exempt status. Taxpayers may also be exempt from paying certain amounts of ordinary income or capital gains taxes.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Exempt Organization Types.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Glossary: Tax Exemption.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Glossary: Tax Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses,\" Page 11.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Form 1099-INT, Interest Income.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses,\" Page 16.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 969.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Roth IRAs.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Income Taxes and Your Social Security Benefit.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Veterans Tax Information and Services.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 409, Capital Gains and Losses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 701, Sale of Your Home.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 556, Alternative Minimum Tax.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 6251, Alternative Minimum Tax\u2014Individuals,\" Page 4.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Unrelated Business Tax.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization,\" Pages 22-23.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization,\" Page 22.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 4220, Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status,\" Page 8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 4220, Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status,\" Page 10.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 4220, Applying for 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Status,\" Pages 6-8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Federal Tax Obligations of Non-Profit Corporations.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Information for Political Organizations.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Intermediate Sanctions - Excess Benefit Transactions.\"",
