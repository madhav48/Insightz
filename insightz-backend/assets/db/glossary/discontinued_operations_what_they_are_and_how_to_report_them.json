Although the business component is being shut down, it still could generate a gain or loss in the current accounting period.\n\nThe total gain or loss from the discontinued operations is thus reported, followed by the relevant income taxes. This tax is often a future tax benefit because discontinued operations often incur losses. To determine the company\u2019s totalnet income (NI), the gain or loss from discontinued operations is aggregated with that of continuing operations.\n\nTo not confuse adjustments to the financial statements that relate to previously reported discontinued operations, a company may classify the adjustments separately in the discontinued operations section of its financials. Adjustments may occur because of benefit plan obligations, contingent liabilities, or contingent contract terms.\n\nIf the buyer of a discontinued operation assumes the debt associated with the operation, then any interest expense before the sale is allocated to discontinued operations.Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)do not allow general corporate overhead to be allocated to discontinued operations.\n\nA company may report discontinued operations under GAAP as long as two conditions are met:\n\nIf these two conditions are met, then a company may report discontinued operations on its financial statements.\n\nThe reporting rules underInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)differ slightly from GAAP.

As with GAAP, discontinued operations are reported in a special section of the income statement.\n\nSo that investors can clearly tell the profits and cash flows from continuing operations apart from activities that have ceased.\n\nA company has multiple line items to report on its financial statements regarding discontinued operations. The total gain or loss from the discontinued operations is reported, followed by the relevant income taxes.\n\n\u201cDiscontinued operations\u201d is a term in financial accounting.
