  "term": "What Is the Dark Web?",
  "definition": "The dark web refers to encrypted online content and allows individuals to hide their identity and location from others. Dark web content is not indexed by conventional search engines. To access the dark web, users must install a private browser, like theTOR Browser, use aVirtual Private Network (VPN), and ensure their computer remains safe and secure.\n\nDue to anonymity on the dark web, many consider it a place where onlinemarketplacesfor drugs,exchangesfor stolen data, and other illegal activities occur. Despite this, there may be legitimate reasons people choose to use the dark web, including political dissidents and those who want to keep certain information private.\n\nThe dark web can provide legal authorities with the additional tools they need to apprehend the perpetrators of unethical activities.The dark web is a secret network and a series of websites hidden from the general public, and unaccessible through traditional search engines likeGoogle.\n\nTraditional search engines return results from indexes of links to websites, ranked based on keywords and relevancy. The dark web uses information unavailable on other search engines, such as content from individual accounts, email,social media, banking, personal and professional databases, and medical and legal documents.\n\nThe TOR network, or the Onion Routing project, is a secure, encrypted protocol that can ensure privacy for data and communications on the web. The TOR technology was initially developed and solely used by the U.S. Navy to protect sensitive government communications.\n\nThe dark web officially appeared in the early 2000s with the creation of Freenet, developed by Ian Clarke to secure users against government intervention and cyber attacks. The system allows users to express themselves freely without being tracked online.\n\nThe U.S. Naval Research Laboratory funded The Onion Router (TOR). TOR offered intelligence sources a way to communicate easily and safely, especially in hostile areas where personal safety is key. It is now one of the most common browsers used to access the dark web.\n\nThe rise of cryptocurrencies increased the popularity of the dark web, especially for cyber criminals. Digital currencies provide anonymity for people who buy and sell on the dark web.People often confuse the dark web withcryptocurrencies, because many crypto transactions for coins such asBitcoinoccur on the web. However, individuals do not have to use the dark web to purchase cryptocurrencies.\n\nTheG20and theFinancial Action Task Force(FATF) have both called for cryptocurrency companies to provide information on buyers and sellers in transactions conducted online. This is especially true, they say, to help law enforcement track criminal organizations and illicit activities.\n\nRoss Ulbricht was investigated and arrested in 2013 for creating and running the dark web site The Silk Road, a darknet website authorities said was used to buy and sell narcotics.\n\nThe dark web and thedeep webare also often erroneously used interchangeably. The dark web is one part of the deep web, also called the invisible web or the hidden web. The information found on the deep web is normally encrypted and isn't found on indexes. It includes the pages that don\u2019t pop up when you run a web search. It also contains everything that requires a login, such as content from:\n\nThe information on the dark web can also include anything on subscriber-only databases rather than anything illegal.\n\nThe dark web helps people to maintain privacy and freely express their views. Privacy is essential for many innocent people terrorized by stalkers and other criminals. The popularity of the dark web with criminals makes it a perfect way for undercover police officers to communicate.\n\nHowever, some may abuse the power of the dark web by making it easier to engage in criminal activity. While the dark web promises privacy to its users, it can also be used to violate the privacy of others. Private photos, medical records, and financial information have all been stolen and shared on the dark web.\n\nDespite what the name implies, it isn't illegal to access the dark web. It provides individuals with privacy and anonymity that traditional websites don't offer. For instance, people can go on the dark web and post their thoughts about political activity without being reprimanded by government officials and other groups.\n\nIndividuals can access the dark web by installing specific, anonymous browsers, such as TOR. Once installed, the browser works the same as a traditional browser. However, it can be hard to find information because the dark web doesn't use an index to locate the desired information. Users will also notice that dark website addresses end with the .onion extension rather than the traditional .com, .org, or .edu.\u00a0Users should install security software to keep their computer and personal information safe.\n\nPersonal information, such as banking, social media, email accounts, and Social Security numbers may be up for sale on the dark web. Individuals can scan the dark web or sign up for a monitoring service. These tools warn users whenever they find information.\n\nTo help protect the information, individuals should change all their passwords, check their credit reports for discrepancies, and inform their bank(s).\n\nThe dark web is used to remain anonymous when using the internet. However, the dark web has gained a negative reputation as a forum for those who want to use it for illicit activities. Users install a private browser and use a VPN.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"The Truth About the Dark Web.\"\n\nNorton. \"Deep Web vs. Dark Web: What's the Difference?\"\n\nNorton. \"How to Safely Access the Deep and Dark Webs.\"\n\nTulane University. \"Everything You Should Know About the Dark Web.\"\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs. \"Ross Ulbricht, AKA Dread Pirate Roberts, Sentenced to Life in Federal Prison for Creating, Operating \u2018Silk Road\u2019 Website.\"",
