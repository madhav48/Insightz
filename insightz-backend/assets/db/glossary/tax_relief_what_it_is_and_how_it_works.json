It may be universal tax cuts,targeted programs that benefit specific groupsof taxpayers, or initiatives like the Child Tax Credit (CTC) or the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\n\nTax relief programs help taxpayers reduce their tax bills through tax deductions, credits, and exclusions. Other programs help taxpayers settle their tax-related debts.\n\nGovernment policy goals may help revise the federal tax code. For example, in response to concerns about the general lack of retirement savings in the U.S., Congress created incentives to encourage savings in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\nTax relief is also available for those affected bynatural disasterslike storms, tornados, flooding, hurricanes, straight-line winds, wildfires, and drought. The relief typically includes filing and payment extensions, penalty and interest waivers, and deductions for casualty and theft losses sustained due to federally declared disasters.\n\nAtax deductionreduces taxable income for the year, thereby lowering a tax bill. Taxpayers cantake the standard deductionor itemize their deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.\n\nThe standard deduction amount is based on filing status, age, and whether the taxpayer is disabled or claimed as a dependent on someone else's income tax return. The standard deduction amounts for the 2024 and 2025 tax years are:\n\nIndividuals age 65 or older or legally blind by the end of tax year 2024 are entitled to an additional standard deduction of $1,950 if single or head of household. For 2024, the standard deduction for a dependent claimed on another taxpayer's return is $1,300 or the individual's earned income plus $450.\n\nItemized deductions are expenses subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower income and tax bills. Individuals can itemize their deductions only if they don't claim the standard deduction. It makes financial sense to itemize if the total amount is greater than the standard deduction. Common itemized deductions include:\n\nUnlike tax deductions, which lower taxable income,tax creditsdirectly reduce the tax individuals owe.Suppose a taxpayer takes the standard deduction and their tax bill amounts to $3,000. If the person is also eligible for a $1,000 tax credit, their final tax bill would be $2,000.\n\nThis type of tax relief is often described as a tax incentive because it reimburses taxpayers for expenditures the government deems worthwhile. For example, theAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)and the Lifetime Learning Credit(LLC)programs give tax credits to people who enroll in post-secondary education programs.Other popular tax credits include:\n\nTax exclusions set aside certain types of income as non-taxable and reduce taxable income. For example, taxpayers can exclude child support payments, life insurance death benefits, and municipal bond income.\n\nA common tax exclusion is employer-sponsored health insurance. Health insurance premiums are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes, and the portion of premiums paid is generally excluded from an individual's taxable income.\n\nThose with acapital gainfrom the sale of a primary residence home canexclude up to $250,000($500,000 if married and filing jointly) of that gain from their income.\n\nIf taxpayers earn income overseas, they might be eligible for theforeign-earned income exclusionand theforeign housing exclusion.\n\nThe IRSFresh Startprogram helps taxpayers catch up on back taxes and avoid tax liens, levies, wage garnishments, and jail time. The program streamlines the tax collection process. Individuals and businesses are eligible for the program which offers several options:\n\nTax credits lower the tax owed, while tax deductions reduce taxable income.Credits provide the most substantial savings.For example, a $1,000 tax credit lowers a tax bill by that same $1,000. Meanwhile, a $1,000 tax deduction reduces taxable income by that amount. For those who fall into the 24% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would shave $240 off of a tax bill.\n\nThe maximum credit allowed for those who adopt a child with special needs is qualified adoption expenses up to $16,810 for the tax year 2024 and $17,280 for the tax year 2025.\n\nThe annual exclusion for gifts is $18,000 for 2024. Taxpayers can give up to $18,000 tax-free to as many people as they wish without using any of their lifetime gift andestate tax exemption.The exclusion increases to $19,000 in 2025.\n\nTax relief is government programs or policies that help lessen the burden of taxes for individuals. These are usually done through tax deductions, credits, and exclusions.\n\nPew Charitable Trust. \"How States Are Working to Address The Retirement Savings Challenge.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Relief in Disaster Situations.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 551 Standard Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 501 Should I Itemize?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 456, Student Loan Interest Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 458, Educator Expense Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 969 Health Savings Accounts and Other Tax-Favored Health Plans.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Credits and Deductions for Individuals.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Lifetime Learning Credit.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"American Opportunity Tax Credit.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Employee Benefits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 502 Medical and Dental Expenses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 701 Sale of Your Home.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Foreign Earned Income Exclusion.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Announces New Effort to Help Struggling Taxpayers Get a Fresh Start; Major Changes Made to Lien Process.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Offer in Compromise.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service, Taxpayer Advocate Program. \"Currently Not Collectible.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Additional Information on Payment Plans.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Penalty Relief Due to Reasonable Cause.\"",
