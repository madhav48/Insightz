  "definition": "The acid-test ratio indicates whether a company can pay its short-term obligations.\n\nThe acid-test ratio is commonly known as the quick ratio. It uses data from a firm's balance sheet to indicate whether it has the means to cover its short-term liabilities. A ratio of 1.0 or more generally indicates that a company can pay its short-term obligations. A ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that it might struggle to pay them.\n\nAnalysts prefer to use the acid-test ratio rather than the current ratio, also known as theworking capital ratio, in certain situations because the acid-test method ignores assets such as inventory that may be difficult to liquidate quickly. The acid-test ratio is a more conservative metric.\n\nCompanies with an acid-test ratio of less than 1.0 don't have enoughliquid assetsto pay their current liabilities and they should therefore be treated cautiously. A company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory if the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio.\n\nThis isn't a bad sign in all cases, however, because some business models are inherently dependent on inventory.\u00a0Retail stores might have very low acid-test ratios without necessarily being in danger. The acceptable range for an acid-test ratio will vary among industries and you'll find that comparisons are most meaningful when you're analyzing peer companies in the same industry.\n\nThe acid-test ratio for most industries should exceed 1.0 but a high ratio isn't always good. It could indicate that cash has accumulated and is sitting idle rather than being reinvested, returned to shareholders, or otherwise put to productive use.\n\nSome tech companies generate massive cash flows and therefore have acid-test ratios as high as 7 or 8. This is certainly better than the alternative but these companies have drawn criticism fromactivist investorswho would prefer that shareholders receive a portion of the profits.\n\nThe numerator of the acid-test ratio can be defined in various ways but the primary consideration should be gaining a realistic view of the company's liquid assets. Cash and cash equivalents should be included as well as short-term investments such as\u00a0marketable securities.\n\nAccounts receivableare generally included but this isn't appropriate for every industry. Accounts receivable in the construction industry may take much more time to recover than is standard practice in other industries so including it could make a firm's financial position seem much more secure than it is in reality.\n\nAcid\u00a0Test=Cash+Marketable\u00a0Securities+A/RCurrent\u00a0Liabilitieswhere:A/R=Accounts\u00a0receivable\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Acid Test} = \\frac{ \\text{Cash} + \\text{Marketable Securities} + \\text{A/R} }{ \\text{Current Liabilities} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{A/R} = \\text{Accounts receivable} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bAcid\u00a0Test=Current\u00a0LiabilitiesCash+Marketable\u00a0Securities+A/R\u200bwhere:A/R=Accounts\u00a0receivable\u200b\n\nAnother way to calculate the numerator is to take all current assets and subtract illiquid assets. Most importantly, inventory should be subtracted. This will negatively skew the picture for retail businesses because of the amount of inventory they carry.\n\nOther elements that appear as assets on a balance sheet should be subtracted if they can't be used to cover liabilities in the short term. These can include advances to suppliers,prepayments, and deferred tax assets.\n\nThe ratio's denominator should include all current liabilities, debts, and obligations due within one year. It's important to note that time isn't factored into the acid-test ratio. A company could be on much shakier ground than its ratio would indicate if its accounts payable are nearly due but its receivables won't come in for months, The opposite can also be true.\n\nThe term \"acid-test\" is rumored to have originated from testingprecious metalslike gold with acid to make sure they were real.\n\nA company's acid-test ratio can be calculated using its balance sheet. This is an abbreviated version of Apple Inc.'s (AAPL)balance sheet as of Jan. 27, 2022, showing the components of the company's current assets and current liabilities. All figures are in millions of dollars:\n\nTo obtain the company's liquid current assets, add:\n\nTo get current liabilities, add:\n\nThen\u00a0divide current liquid assets\u00a0by current liabilities to calculate the acid-test ratio. The calculation would look like this:\n\nNot everyone calculates this ratio in the same way. There's no single, hard-and-fast method for determining a company's acid-test ratio. Some analysts might include other balance sheet line items that aren't included in this example. Others might remove the ones we've used here. It's therefore important to understand how data providers arrive at their conclusions before using the metrics that are given to you.\n\nThe current ratio, also known as the working capital ratio, and the acid-test ratio both measure a company's short-term ability to generate enough cash to pay off all its debts should they become due at once.\n\nThe acid-test ratio is considered more conservative than the current ratio, however, because its calculation ignores items such as inventory which may be difficult to liquidate quickly. Another key difference is that the acid-test ratio includes\u00a0only assets\u00a0that can be converted to cash within\u00a090 days or less. The current ratio includes those that can be converted to cash within one year.\n\nThe acid-test or quick ratio shows if a company has or can get enough cash to pay its immediate liabilities, such as short-term debt. The acid-test ratio for most industries should exceed 1.0. Companies don't have enough liquid assets to pay their current liabilities if it's less than 1.0 and they should therefore be treated with caution.\n\nA company's current assets are highly dependent on inventory if the acid-test ratio is much lower than the current ratio. However, a very high ratio could indicate that accumulated cash is sitting idle rather than being reinvested, returned to shareholders, or otherwise put to productive use.\n\nDivide a company\u2019s current cash, marketable securities, and total accounts receivable by its current liabilities. This information can be found on the company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nThe acid-test ratio, also called the quick ratio, is a metric that's used to determine whether a company is positioned to sell assets within 90 days to meet immediate expenses. Analysts generally believe that a business can pay its immediate expenses if the ratio is more than 1.0. It can't do so if it's less than 1.0.\n\nThe reliability of this ratio depends on the industry of the business you're evaluating so it's best to use it when comparing similar companies.\n\nCorrection\u2014Nov. 8, 2023:A previous version of this article stated that to calculate current liabilities, you have to add accounts payable and other current assets, when it's actually other current liabilities.\n\nCFI Education. \"Acid-Test Ratio.\"\n\nWall Street Prep. \"Acid Test Ratio.\"\n\nApple. \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (Unaudited).\" Page 2.\n\nBILL Operations. \"Quick Ratio (Acid Test Ratio): What You Need to Know.\"",
