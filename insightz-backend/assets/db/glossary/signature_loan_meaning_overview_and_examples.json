Signature loans offer the bestterms\u2014they only require your signature as collateral and typically offer more attractive rates than other types of unsecured debt.\n\nExplore the ins and outs of signature loans and decide if one is right for you.\n\nA signature loan, also known as a \u201cgood faith loan\u201d orcharacter loan, is a type of personal loan offered by banks and other finance companies that only requires the borrower\u2019s signature and a promise to pay rather than physicalcollateralsuch as a car title or a home. A signature loan can typically be used for any purpose that the borrower chooses.Interest ratesmay be higher than other forms of credit due to the lack of collateral, but may be lower than other forms of unsecured credit such as credit cards.\n\nTo determine whether to grant a signature loan, a lender typically looks for a solidcredit historyand sufficientincometo repay the loan. In some cases, the lendermay require a co-signer on the loan, but the co-signer is only called upon in the event that the original lenderdefaultson payments.\n\nSignature loans are one type ofunsecured term loan. \u201cUnsecured\u201d refers to the fact that these loans are not secured by any form of physical collateral, unlike home mortgages and car loans. \u201cTerm\u201d means the loan isamortizedover a predetermined time period and paid off in equal monthly installments.\n\nApplications for regular credit or revolving credit loans normally trigger a funding delay while the banking institution or loan company examines the borrower\u2019s credit history and checks personal qualifications.By contrast, the funds obtained through signature loansare deposited in the borrower\u2019s account more quickly, allowing earlier allocation to financial needs.\n\nAs soon as a signature loan is paid off, the account is closed, and the borrower needs to apply for a new loan if they require additional funds. In contrast, arevolving creditaccount allows the indebted party to repay the loan and maintain the line of credit until the borrower or lender chooses to end the relationship and close the account.\n\nBorrowers use signature loans for a range of purposes, includinghome improvement,unexpected expenses, medical bills, vacations, and other large expenditures. Some borrowers also use signature loans to consolidate other debts.\n\nAdding a co-signer on a signature loan may help a borrower with a minimal credit history or a low income.\n\nLet\u2019s say a borrower gets a signature loan with a 7% interest rate for an amount equal to the total of balances that they are carrying on credit cards, with rates ranging from 12% to 20%. The borrower then uses the signature loan to pay off the credit cards in full. The borrower will realize distinct savings by repaying the same amount of money at 7% rather than at the former higher rates.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking about taking out a signature loan, then apersonal loan calculatorcould be useful\u00a0for figuring out what the monthly payment and totalinterestshould be for the amount you\u2019re looking to borrow.\n\nA signature loan is a type of personal loan. It\u2019s different from other kinds of personal loans because it\u2019s unsecured. The only collateral is the borrower\u2019s signature and a promise to pay.\n\nBorrowers withgood creditare typically candidates for signature loans because they have established a record of payingdebtsand are a low risk for defaulting. People withpoor creditmay still be able to secure a signature loan with the help of a co-signer. There are even somesignature loans that don\u2019t require a credit check, though these are oftenpayday loans, which typically have exorbitantly high interest rates.\n\nThey can start at as little as $500 and go up to $50,000.However, keep in mind that not all banks and credit unions offer signature loans.\n\nSignature loans are a type of personal loan requiring only a promise to pay as collateral. While in the past they were typically made to people with poor credit, today they are pretty much reserved for customers with better credit scores.\n\nRemember that not all banks offer signature loans, and interest rates tend to be higher than with secured loans.\n\nQuicken Loans. \u201cWhat Is a Signature Loan, and How Does One Work?\u201d\n\nCorporate Finance Institute. \u201cRevolving Credit Facility.\u201d\n\nExperian. \u201cWhat Is a Signature Loan?\u201d",
