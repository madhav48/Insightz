  "term": "What Is Business Intelligence (BI)? Types, Benefits, and Examples",
  "definition": "Business intelligence (BI) is a technology-driven process that analyzes business data and transforms it into actionable insights, helping executives and managers make better-informed decisions.\n\nBusiness intelligence is a broad term that encompassesdata mining, process analysis, performance benchmarking, anddescriptive analytics. It parses all the data a business generates and presents easy-to-digest reports, performance measures, and trends that inform management decisions.\n\nBusiness intelligence should not be confused with business analytics. Business intelligence analyzes current operational data to drive decision-making, while business analytics delves deeper into predictive insights for future growth.Ultimately, business intelligence drives global economic growth, as it helps organizations identify trends, optimize operations, and seize new opportunities.\n\nThe need for BI was derived from the concept that managers with inaccurate or incomplete information will tend, on average, to make poorer decisions than if they had better information. Creators offinancial modelsrecognize this as \u201cgarbage in, garbage out,\" highlighting the importance of quality information in decision-making.\n\nBI aims to solve this problem by collecting, transforming, and analyzing data, ideally presenting it through dashboards and other visual formats tosupport better decisions.The process typically follows four steps: data collection, analysis, visualization, and action. BI tools automate much of this process, allowing companies to make quicker, more accurate decisions by identifying trends, uncovering inconsistencies, and providing actionable insights in real-time.\n\nMost companies can benefit from incorporating BI solutions; managers with inaccurate or incomplete information will tend, on average, to make worse decisions than if they had better information.\n\nBusinesses can streamline their operations, improve customer experience, and optimize sales and marketing efforts.However, to be useful, BI must seek to increase the accuracy, timeliness, and amount of data.\n\nThese requirements mean finding more ways to capture information that isn't already being recorded, checking the information for errors, and structuring it so that broad analysis is possible.\n\nIn practice, however, companies have data that's unstructured or in diverse formats that make it difficult to collect and analyze. Software firms thus provide business intelligence solutions tooptimize the information gleaned from data. These are enterprise-level software applications designed to unify a company\u2019s data andanalytics.\n\nAlthough software solutions continue to evolve and become increasingly sophisticated, data scientists still need to manage the trade-offs between speed and the depth of reporting.\n\nSome of the insights emerging frombig datahave companies scrambling to capture everything, but data analysts can usually filter out sources to find a selection of data points that can represent the health of a process or business area as a whole. This can reduce the need to capture and reformat everything for analysis, saving analytical time and increasing the reporting speed.\n\nThe demand for professionals skilled in business intelligence has surged across industries, making it a highly sought-after skill set in today's job market.\n\nBI tools and software come in a wide variety of forms. Here is a quick look at some common types of BI solutions.\n\nThere are many reasons why companies adopt BI. Many use it\u00a0to support functions as diverse as hiring,compliance, production, and marketing. BI is a core business value; it's difficult to find a business area that doesn't benefit from better information to work with.\n\nSome of the many benefits companies can experience after adopting BI into their business models include faster, more accurate reporting and analysis, improved data quality, better employee satisfaction, reduced costs, increased revenues, and the ability to make better business decisions.\n\nIf, for example, you're in charge of production schedules for several beverage factories and sales are showing strong month-over-month growth in a particular region, you can approve extra shifts in near real-time to ensure your factories can meet demand.\n\nSimilarly, if a cooler-than-normal summer starts impacting sales, you can quickly idle down that same production. This production manipulation is a limited example of how BI can increase profits and reduce costs when used properly.\n\nCoca-Cola Bottling had a problem with its daily manual reporting processes: they restricted access to real-time sales and operations data. However, by replacing the manual process with an automated BI system, the company completely streamlined the process and saved 260 hours a year (or more than six 40-hour work weeks). Now, the company's team can quickly analyze metrics like delivery operations, budget, and profitability with just a few clicks.\n\nAnother example: HelloFresh, a meal kit company, faced challenges with manual, time-intensive digital marketing reporting. By implementing a centralized BI solution, the marketing analytics team saved 10-20 daily working hours by automating the reporting process.\u00a0It also allowed HelloFresh to create regional, individualized marketing campaigns based on customer behavior data, leading to higher conversion rates and improved customer retention.\n\nPower BI is a business analytics product offered by software giant Microsoft. According to the company, it allows both individuals and businesses to connect to, model, and visualize data using a scalable platform.\n\nSelf-service BI is an approach to analytics that allows individuals without a technical background to access and explore data. In other words, it gives people throughout the organization, not just those in the IT department, a way to have control over the data.\n\nDrawbacks to self-service BI include a false sense of security in end-users, high licensing costs, a lack of data granularity, and sometimes too much accessibility.\n\nOne of IBM's main BI products is its Cognos Analytics tool, which the company touts as an all-inclusive, AI-powered BI solution.\n\nPart of the responsibilities of executives and managers is to make their companies more efficient, profitable, and competitive, along with improving the workplace environment for employees. Companies can do this with technology-driven processes, known as business intelligence, allowing them to achieve these goals faster and correctly.\n\nHarvard University - Business Analytics Program. \"Business Intelligence vs. Business Analytics.\"\n\nHoward University - Center for Digital Business. \"Breaking Down the Basics of Business Intelligence.\"\n\nMicrosoft. \"What Is Business Intelligence?\"\n\nHoward University - Center for Digital Business. \"Breaking Down the Basics of Business Intelligence.\"\n\nTableau. \"Coca-Cola Bottling Company Empowers the Enterprise with Tableau Mobile Dashboards to Drive Bottom Line.\"\n\nTableau. \"Real-World Applications of Business Intelligence.\"\n\nIBM. \"IBM Cognos Analytics With Watson.\"",
