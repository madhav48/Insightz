  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) technology allows computers and machines tosimulate human intelligenceand problem-solving tasks. The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take action to achieve a specific goal.\n\nAI research began in the 1950s and was used in the 1960s by the U.S. Department of Defense when it trained computers to mimic human reasoning.\n\nA subset of artificial intelligence ismachine learning (ML), a concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without human assistance.\n\nArtificial intelligence commonly brought to mind the implementation ofrobots. As technology evolved, previous benchmarks that define artificial intelligence became outdated.\n\nTechnologies that enable artificial intelligence include:\n\nAlgorithmsoften play a part in the structure of artificial intelligence, where simple algorithms are used in simple applications, while more complex ones help frame strong artificial intelligence.\n\nNarrow AI: Also known asweak AI, this system is designed to carry out one particular job. Weak AI systems include video games and personal assistants like Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Apple\u2019s Siri. Users ask the assistant a question, which it answers for you.\n\nGeneral AI: This type includesstrong artificial intelligencesystems that carry on the tasks considered to be human-like. They tend to be more complex and complicated and can be found in applications like self-driving cars or hospital operating rooms.\n\nSuper AI is a strictly theoretical type of AI and has not yet been realized. Super AI would think, reason, learn, and possess cognitive abilities that surpass those of human beings.\n\nArtificial intelligence can be applied tomany sectors and industries, includingcredit scoring, law enforcement, and the healthcare industry. In a medical setting, it can be useful for suggesting drug dosages, identifying treatments, and aiding in surgical procedures in the operating room.\n\nOther examples of machines with artificial intelligence include computers that play chess andself-driving cars. AI hasapplications in the financial industry, where it detects and flags fraudulent banking activity. Applications for AI can helpstreamline and make trading easier.\n\nIn 2022, AI entered the mainstream with applications of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT). The most popular applications are OpenAI\u2019sDALL-Etext-to-image tool andChatGPT.According to a 2024 survey by Deloitte, 79% of respondents who are leaders in the AI industry expect generative AI to transform their organizations by 2027.\n\nReactive AI is a type of narrow AI that uses algorithms to optimize outputs based on a set of inputs. Chess-playing AIs, for example, are reactive systems that optimize the best strategy to win the game. Reactive AI tends to be fairly static, unable to learn or adapt to novel situations.\n\nMany are concerned with how artificial intelligence mayaffect human employment. With many industries looking to automate certain jobs with intelligent machinery, there is a concern that employees would be pushed out of the workforce. Self-driving cars may remove the need for taxis and car-share programs, while manufacturers may easily replace human labor with machines, making people\u2019s skills obsolete.\n\nIn healthcare settings, AI is used to assist in diagnostics. AI can identify small anomalies in scans to better triangulate diagnoses from a patient\u2019s symptoms and vitals. AI can classify patients, maintain and track medical records, and deal with health insurance claims.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is an evolving technology that tries to simulate human intelligence using machines. AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning, which allow systems to learn and adapt in novel ways from training data. It has vastapplications across multiple industries, such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.While AI offers significant advancements, it also raises ethical, privacy, and employment concerns.\n\nSAS. \u201cArtificial Intelligence.\u201d\n\nOpenAI. \u201cDALL\u00b7E: Creating Images From Text.\u201d\n\nDeloitte. \u201cThe State of Generative AI in the Enterprise: Q1 Report, January 2024.\u201d Page 7.",
