  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years.

Total return includes interest,capital gains, dividends, anddistributionsrealized over a period. Total return accounts for two categories of return: income including interest paid by fixed-income investments, distributions, or dividends andcapital appreciation, representing the change in the market price of an asset.\n\nTotal return is the amount ofvalue an investor earnsfrom a security over a specific period, typically one year when all distributions are reinvested. The total return is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. For example, a total return of 20% means the security increased by 20% of its original value due to a price increase, distribution of dividends (if a stock),coupons(if a bond), or capital gains (if a fund). It is a strong measure of an investment\u2019s overall performance.\n\nSome of the best dividend stocks have low growth potential and produce small capital gains. Basing an investment\u2019sreturn on capital gainsalone does not take into consideration price increases or other methods of growing the stock\u2019s value. For example, an investor buys shares of Company B, and the share price increases 24.5% in one year. The investor gains 24.5% from theprice changealone. Since Company B also paid a dividend during the year, adding in the stock\u2019syieldof 4.1% to the price change, the combined return is 28.6%.\n\nThe investor may wish to calculatedividend-adjusted return. This figure considers both the stock price appreciation and its dividends. The dividend-adjusted return provides a more accurate valuation of a stock's return.\n\nTotal return determines an investment\u2019s true growth over time. It is important to evaluate the big picture and not just one return metric when determining an increase in value.\n\nTotal return is used when analyzing a company\u2019s historical performance. Calculating expected future returns puts reasonable expectations on an investor\u2019s investments and helps plan for retirement or other needs.\n\nWhen analyzingmutual fundperformance, investors should analyze their average annual total returns for different periods. Comparing returns to abenchmarkindicates how the fund has performed, relative to an index. When analyzing average annual total returns, it's important to remember:\n\nAn investor buys 100 shares of Stock A at $20 per share for an initial value of $2,000. Stock A pays a 5% dividend the investor reinvests, buying five additional shares. After one year, theshare pricerises to $22.\n\nTo calculate the investment'stotal return, the investor divides the total investment gains (105 shares x $22 per share = $2,310 current value - $2,000 initial value = $310 total gains) by the initial value of the investment ($2,000) and multiplies by 100 to convert the answer to a percentage ($310 / $2,000 x 100 = 15.5%). The investor's total return is 15.5%.",
