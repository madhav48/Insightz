  "term": "What Is Activity-Based Budgeting (ABB)? How It Works and Example",
  "definition": "Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is a system that records, researches, and analyzesactivitiesthat lead to costs for a company. Every activity in an organization that incurs a cost is scrutinized for potential ways to createefficiencies.Budgetsare then developed based on these results.\n\nActivity-based budgeting (ABB) is more rigorous than traditionalbudgetingprocesses, which tend to merely adjust previous budgets to account forinflationor business development.\n\nKeeping costs to a minimumis a crucial part of business management. When done effectively and not too excessively, companies should be able to maintain and keep growing theirrevenues, while squeezing out higherprofitsfrom them.\n\nUsing activity-based budgeting (ABB) can help companies to reduce the activity levels required to generate sales. Eliminating unnecessary costs should boost profitability.\n\nThe activity-based budgeting (ABB) process is broken down into three steps.\n\nActivity-based budgeting (ABB) is an alternative budgeting practice. Traditional methods are more simplistic, adjusting prior period budgets to account for inflation or revenue growth. Rather than using past budgets to calculate how much a firm will spend in the current year, activity-based budgeting (ABB) digs deeper.\n\nActivity-based budgeting (ABB) is not necessary for all companies. For example, established firms that experience minimal change typically find that applying a flat rate to data from the previous year to reflect business growth and\u00a0inflation is sufficient.\n\nIn contrast, newer companies without access tohistorical\u00a0budgeting\u00a0informationcannot consider this an option. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is also likely to be implemented by firms undergoing material changes, such as those with newsubsidiaries, significant customers, business locations, or products. In these types of cases, historical information may no longer be a useful basis for future budgeting.\n\nCompany A anticipates receiving 50,000 sales orders in the upcoming year, with each single order costing $2 to process. Therefore, the activity-based budget (ABB) for the expenses relating to processing sales orders for the upcoming year is $100,000 ($50,000 * $2).\n\nThis figure may be compared to a traditional approach to budgeting. If last year\u2019s budget called for $80,000 of sales order processing expenses and sales were expected to grow 10%, only $88,000 ($80,000 + ($80,000 * 10%)) is budgeted.\n\nActivity-based budgeting (ABB) systems allow for more control over the budgeting process. Revenue and expense planning occurs at a precise level that\u00a0provides useful details regarding projections. ABB allows for management to have increased control over the budgeting process and to align the budget with overall company goals.\n\nUnfortunately, these benefits come at a cost. Activity-based budgeting (ABB) is more expensive to implement and maintain than traditional budgeting techniques and more time consuming as well. Moreover, ABB systems need additional assumptions and insight from management, which can, on occasion, result in potential budgeting inaccuracies.",
