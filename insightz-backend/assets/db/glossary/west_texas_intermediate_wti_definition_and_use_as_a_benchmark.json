  "term": "West Texas Intermediate (WTI): Definition and Use As a Benchmark",
  "definition": "West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is a grade of crude oil and one of the main three benchmarks in oil pricing, along with Brent and Dubai Crude. WTI is considered a high-quality oil that is relatively easy to refine.\n\nWTI is known as a light sweet oil. It contains less than 0.50% sulfur, whereas the norm is about 0.24% to 0.34%, making it \"sweet.\" It also has a low density, making it \"light.\"\n\nWTI is the underlying commodity of theNew York Mercantile Exchange's (NYMEX) oil futures contract.\n\nWTI is the main oil benchmark for North America, as it is sourced from the United States. It originates mainly in the Permian Basin, the site of the nation's highest-producing oil field. The oil travels via pipeline from Texas to refineries in the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe maindelivery pointfor physical exchange and price settlement for WTI is Cushing, Oklahoma, known as \"The Pipeline Crossroads of the World.\" TheCushing hubdelivery system consists of 35 (20 inbound and 15 outbound) pipelines and 16 storage terminals.\n\nThe hub has 90 million barrels of storage capacity and accounts for 13% of U.S. oil storage. The inbound and outbound capacity is 6.5 million barrels a day.\n\nAbenchmarkin the oil market serves as a reference price for buyers and sellers of crude oil. Oil benchmarks are frequently referred to in the media as theprice of oil.\n\nBrent crudeand WTI crude are the most popular benchmarks, but their prices are often contrasted. The difference in price between Brent and WTI is called the Brent-WTI spread.\n\nWTI is not the most commonly used benchmark globally. That honor goes to Brent, which is used as a benchmark globally in two-thirds of oil contracts.\n\nWTI and Brent, however, are both considered high-quality oils and therefore are the two most important oil benchmarks in the world.\n\nWTI has a sulfur content between 0.24% and 0.34%, whereas Brent has a sulfur content between 0.35% to 0.40%.The lower the sulfur content of an oil, the easier it is to refine, making it more desirable to producers. A sulfur content below 0.5% is considered sweet.\n\nBoth benchmark oils are considered sweet, but WTI is sweeter, making it a bit easier to refine.\n\nTheoretically, WTI crude should tradeat a premiumto Brent crude, given the quality, but this is not always the case. While the two crude oil varieties can trade at similar price points, each one has its own unique supply and demand market, and therefore its price reflects distinct market fundamentals.\n\nSince the shale boom in the U.S., which resulted in a production increase of WTI, the price of WTI has gone down and usually trades at a discount to Brent. Brent is also tied to more worldwide oil markets, meaning that more factors are influencing its price.\n\nFurthermore, transporting WTI overseas to Brent crude's market can be costly, making it difficult for WTI to compete with Brent crude in terms of pricing.\n\nThe U.S. exports more petroleum products than it imports.\n\nIn 2023, the U.S. imported about 8.51 million barrels per day of petroleum products from 86 countries. The same year, it exported about 10.15 million barrels of petroleum to 173 countries and three U.S. territories.\n\nPetroleum products include crude oil, hydrocarbon gas liquids, refined petroleum products, and biofuels.\n\nThe top five source countries for petroleum products imported into the U.S. are Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Brazil.\n\nCrude oil is a mixture of hydrocarbons found in liquid form underground and brought to the surface for refining into fuel and other products. Petroleum products are processed in refineries from crude oil and other liquids. Petroleum is a broad term that includes both crude oil and petroleum products.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate is a high-quality crude oil sourced in West Texas. As one of the world's foremost sources of crude oil, WTI is a benchmark for the U.S. oil industry and investors. When you hear a reference to crude oil prices in a business report, it's the price of West Texas Intermediate that is being quoted.\n\nFocusEconomics. \"What Is the Difference Between WTI and Brent Crude Oil?\"\n\nRBN Energy. \"Cushing, Oklahoma Crude Oil Infrastructure Map.\"\n\nPurple Trading. \"WTI Oil \u2013 Definition and Characteristics.\"\n\nCharles Schwab. \"Energy Investing Basics: WTI vs. Brent Crude Oil.\"\n\nExxonMobile. \"Crude Oil Blends by API Gravity and By Sulfur Content.\"\n\nU.S. Energy Administration. \"How much petroleum does the United States import and export?\"\n\nU.S. Energy Administration. \"How much petroleum does the United States import and export?\"\n\nU.S. Energy Administration. \"What is the difference between crude oil, petroleum products, and petroleum?\"",
