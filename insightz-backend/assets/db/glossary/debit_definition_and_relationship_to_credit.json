  "term": "Debit: Definition and Relationship to Credit",
  "definition": "A debit is an entry in a double-entry accounting system that decreases liabilities or increases assets on a company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nA debit is an accounting entry that results in either an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities on a company\u2019s balance sheet. In double-entry accounting, every debit is offset by a credit.\n\nFor instance, if a company takes out a loan to purchase equipment, it would simultaneously debit fixed assets and credit a liabilities account, depending on the nature of the loan.\n\nThe abbreviation for debit is sometimes \u201cdr,\u201d which is short for debtor.\n\nInvestopedia / Madelyn Goodnight\n\nIn adouble-entryaccounting system, debits are the opposite of credits.\n\nIna standard journal entry, all debits are placed as the top lines, while all credits are listed on the line below debits. When usingT-accounts, a debit is on the left side of the chart while a credit is on the right side.\n\nDebits and credits are used in the trial balance and adjusted trial balance to ensure that all entries balance. The total dollar amount of all debits must equal the total dollar amount of all credits. In other words, finances must balance.\n\nFor example, if Barnes & Noble sold $20,000 worth of books, it would debit its cash account $20,000 and credit its books or inventory account $20,000. This double-entry system shows that the company now has $20,000 more in cash and a corresponding $20,000 less in books.\n\nAdangling\u00a0debitis a debit balance with no offsetting credit balance that would allow it to be written off. It reflects discrepancies in a company\u2019sbalance sheet. It may indicate that a company has purchased goodwill or services that create a debit.\n\nCertain types of accounts have natural balances in financial accounting systems. Assets and expenses have natural debit balances. This means that positive values for assets and expenses are debited and negative balances are credited.\n\nFor example, if a company receives $1,000 in cash, ajournalentry would include a debit of $1,000 to the cash account in the balance sheet, because cash is increasing. If another transaction involves a payment of $500 in cash, the journal entry would have a credit to the cash account of $500 because cash is being reduced. In effect, a debit increases an expense account in the income statement, and a credit decreases it.\n\nLiabilities, revenues, and equity accounts have natural credit balances. If a debit is applied to any of these accounts, the account balance has decreased.\n\nFor example, a debit to the accounts payable account in the balance sheet indicates a reduction in a liability. The offsetting credit is most likely a credit to cash because the reduction of a liability means that the debt is being paid and cash is an outflow.\n\nFor the revenue accounts in the income statement, debit entries decrease the account, while a credit points to an increase in the account.\n\nThe concept of debits and offsetting credits are the cornerstone of double-entry accounting.\n\nDebit notes\u00a0are a form of proof that one business has created a legitimate debit entry in the course of dealing with another business (B2B).\n\nThis might occur when a purchaser returns materials to a supplier and needs to validate the reimbursed amount.\u00a0In this case,\u00a0the purchaser issues a debit note reflecting the accounting transaction.\n\nA business might issue a debit note in response to a received credit note. Mistakes (often related to interest charges or fees)\u00a0in a sales, purchase, or loan invoice might prompt a company to issue a debit note to correct the error.\n\nA debit note or debit receipt is very similar to an\u00a0invoice. The main difference is that invoices record a sale, while debit notes and debit receipts reflect adjustments or returns on transactions that have already taken place.\n\nWhenbuying on margin, investors borrow funds from their brokerage and use the money in addition to their own to purchase more shares than they otherwise would be able to purchase. The debit amount recorded by the brokerage in an investor\u2019s account represents the\u00a0cash cost\u00a0of the\u00a0transaction\u00a0to the investor.\n\nThe debit balance in a\u00a0margin account is the amount of money owed by the customer to the broker (or another lender) for money advanced to purchase securities. The debit balance is the amount of funds that the customer must put into their margin account, following the successful execution of a security purchase order, to settle the transaction.\n\nThe debit balance can be contrasted with the\u00a0credit balance. While a\u00a0long margin position\u00a0has a debit balance, a margin account with only\u00a0short positions\u00a0will show a credit balance.\n\nThe credit balance is the sum of the proceeds from a short sale and the\u00a0required margin\u00a0amount underRegulation T, which is part of a set of Federal Reserve rules for lending by brokerages.\n\nSometimes, a trader\u2019s margin account has both long and short margin positions.\u00a0Adjusted debit balance\u00a0is the amount in a margin account that is owed to the brokerage firm, minus profits on short sales and balances in a special miscellaneous account (SMA).\n\nCertain accounts are used for valuation purposes and are displayed on the financial statements opposite the normal balances. These accounts are called contra accounts.\n\nThe debit entry to a contra account has the opposite effect as it would to a normal account.\n\nFor example, anallowance for uncollectable accountsoffsets the asset accounts receivable. Because the allowance is a negative asset, a debit actually decreases the allowance. A contra asset\u2019s debit is the opposite of a normal account\u2019s debit, which increases the asset.\n\nA debit is an accounting entry that results in either an increase in assets or a decrease in liabilities on a company\u2019s balance sheet. Double-entry accounting is based on the recording of debits and the credits that offset them.\n\nDebits are the opposite of credits in an accounting system. Assets and expenses have natural debit balances, while liabilities and revenues have natural credit balances.\n\nA debit is always an increase in assets. All accounts that normally contain a debit balance will increase in amount when a debit (the left column) is added to them and reduced when a credit (the right column) is added to them.\n\nThe types of accounts to which this rule applies are expenses, assets, and dividends.\n\nA debit is an accounting entry that creates a decrease in liabilities or an increase in assets. In double-entry bookkeeping, all debits are made on the left side of the ledger and must be offset with corresponding credits on the right side of the ledger. On a balance sheet, positive values for assets and expenses are debited, and negative balances are credited.\n\nThe recording of debits and credits is the basis of double-entry bookkeeping.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cMargin Regulation.\"",
