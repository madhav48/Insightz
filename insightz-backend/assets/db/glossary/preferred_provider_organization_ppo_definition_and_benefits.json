  "term": "Preferred Provider Organization (PPO): Definition and Benefits",
  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA preferred provider organization (PPO) is ahealth insuranceplan for individuals and families. PPOs involve networks made up of contracted healthcare providers, including doctors, hospitals, and other medical professionals.Healthcare facilities and practitioners, known as preferred providers, offer services to the insurer's plan policyholders at reduced rates. Plan participants receive the maximum PPO benefit when they visit in-network healthcare professionals and are also offered coverage when they see out-of-network providers.\n\nA preferred provider organization is a managed-care network consisting of medical professionals and facilities\u2014such as primary and specialty physicians, hospitals, and other healthcare professionals\u2014who contract with insurance providers to render services to subscribed participants. These are plan participants or consumers who are covered by the insurer's healthcare plan.\n\nPlansnegotiatefees and schedules for services with healthcare professionals and facilities. As such, the agreed-upon rate is typically lower than their usual charges. In exchange for reduced rates, insurers pay the PPO a fee to access the network of providers.\n\nPPO participants are free to use the services of any provider within their network. They are encouraged, but not required, to name a primary care physician, and don't need referrals to visit a specialist. Subscribers may go out of network for coverage but it often comes at a higher cost.\n\nPPOs may be sponsored by a particular insurance company, one or more employers, or some other type of organization.\n\nThere are a number of costs associated with PPOs, and premiums tend to be higher than other types of insurance plans. PPO plans tend to charge higher premiums because they are costlier to administer and manage. Participants are generally responsible forcopayments, which are paid directly to the provider at each visit. There are alsodeductiblesthat patients must meet before the plans start kicking in and paying claims in full.\n\nAs noted above, plan participants are also allowed to visit out-of-network facilities, usually at a higher cost. These charges are based on areasonable and customaryfee schedule.If those claims made by these healthcare providers exceed the reasonable and customary fees for services rendered, coverage may not apply or, most commonly, the excess charge is passed on to the patient.\n\nOne important point to note is the degree of flexibility associated with the higher cost of PPOs. These plans offer more options than others available on the market. PPO networks are typically large, with providers in many cities and states. Choosing a provider or accessing one in urgent situations provides value to participants.\n\nThough PPOs and HMOs make up a large portion of the health insurance plans offered, they don't represent the entire market.Other arrangements include exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), which are managed-care plans where services are covered only if you use doctors, specialists, or hospitals in the plan\u2019s network (except in an emergency).Point of service(POS) plans involve lower fees for using providers that belong to the plan\u2019s network. POS participants can go out of network but need referrals to see a specialist.\n\nIn contrast to PPOs,health maintenance organization(HMO) plans require participants to receive healthcare services from a network of assigned providers. The insured must first choose a PCP from the network, and the PCP serves as thefirst point of contactfor all health issues and provides referrals to specialists.\n\nAs noted above, PPO plans charge higher premiums than almost every other plan for the convenience, accessibility, and freedom they offer. This includes a wider choice of hospitals and doctors. Plans with the lowest/fewestout-of-pocket expenses, such as those with low deductibles and low copayments, have higher premiums. The elevated premium cost is due to the insurer absorbing more of the associated costs.\u00a0Conversely,lower-premium alternativestranslate into higher out-of-pocket costs for the insured and lower costs for the insurer.\n\nPPO plans come with more comprehensive coverage, including many services that other managed-care programs might exclude or for which they would charge an additional premium.\n\nPPO plans have historically been the preferred choice among employer group participants. However, today, participants want more options for managed healthcare.Therefore, many employers offer HMO plans\u00a0among others. Because HMO premiums are less expensive, some participants favor HMO plans for their affordability, although services and freedoms typically associated with HMO plans are often restricted.\n\nAhealth insurance deductibleis an amount you must pay out of pocket for medical services each year; after you've met it, your insurance coverage kicks in. PPO plans may have two different annual deductibles. One applies to providers in the PPO network, and the other\u2014usually a larger sum\u2014to providers outside the network. The latter is larger because the PPO wants to encourage you to stay in-network, using its preferred providers.\n\nPPO plans tend to be more expensive than other managed-care options. They typically have higher monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, like deductibles. You often have bothcoinsurance and copays. This is the tradeoff for the flexibility PPOs provide, allowing you to use providers both within and outside the PPO network without needing referrals.\n\nThe costs for coinsurance and deductibles can be different for in-network and out-of-network providers and services. Some may find it onerous to have more responsibility for managing and coordinating their own care without a primary care doctor.\n\nThe biggest difference between PPO and POS plans is generally flexibility. Both plans cover you whether you use providers and facilities in or out of the network. However, a POS requires you to have a primary care physician and get referrals from them if you want to see a specialist or anyone else. PPOs don't. Costs are another consideration. PPOs tend to be more expensive than POS plans\u2014the premiums are higher and they usually come with deductibles that must be met before your coverage begins.\n\nA preferred provider organization (PPO) is a type of managed-care health insurance plan. PPO plan participants are free to use the services of any provider within their network. They are encouraged, but not required, to name a primary care physician, and don't need referrals to visit a specialist.\n\nPPO plans are more comprehensive in their coverage and offer a wider range of providers and services than HMOs. However, the costs associated with PPOs include higher insurance premiums, copays, and deductibles. Choosing between a PPO and an HMO generally involves weighing one's desire for greater accessibility to doctors and services versus the cost of the plan.\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Preferred Provider Organization (PPO)\".\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"Managed Care Organization.\"\n\nScienceDirect. \"Preferred Provider Organization; Evolution of Managed Care.\"\n\nHumana. \"What is a PPO; More Flexibility.\"\n\neHealth. \"Understanding PPOs (Preferred Provider Organizations).\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"UCR (usual, customary, and reasonable).\"\n\nU.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"Questions you may have about PPOs.\"\n\nMcKinsey & Company. \"The Individual Health Insurance Market in 2023.\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).\"\n\nKFF. \"2023 Employer Health Benefits Survey.\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Deductible.\"\n\nMetLife. \"What is Coinsurance?\"",
