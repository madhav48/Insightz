  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nAn heir is defined as an individual who is legally entitled to inherit some or all of the estate of another person who dies intestate.\n\nDying intestate means the deceased person failed to establish a legal last will and testament during their living years. In such a scenario, the heir receives property according to the laws of the state in which the property is probated.\n\nHeirs who inherit property are typically children, descendants, or other close relatives of the decedent. Spouses typically are not legally considered to be heirs, as they are instead entitled to properties via marital or community property laws.\n\nWhen there is more than one heir with the same relationship to the deceased, such as the case when there are two siblings, those individuals typically divide up the estate equally.\n\nThe portion of a deceasedperson\u2019s estatethat\u2019s bequeathed to an heir is known as an inheritance. This inheritance can involve cash, stocks, bonds, real estate, and other personal property such as automobiles, furniture, antiques, artwork, and jewelry.\n\nThere are many specific types of heirs, including the following:\n\nWhen an individual dies without a will, it is known as dyingintestate. The term can also refer to a situation where the will is considered to be invalid. The manner in which the deceased\u2019s assets will be distributed in intestacy is decided by a probate court.\n\nWhen a person dies intestate, a court administrator will oversee the deceased\u2019s estate. They will gather all assets, pay off any liabilities, and distribute the remaining assets to the individuals considered to be thebeneficiariesof the deceased; the heirs-at-law. The probate process is determined by state law and thus can be different from state to state.\n\nThe remaining assets are passed to the beneficiaries via intestate succession, which determines the hierarchy of how the assets will be given. The intestate succession starts with the deceased\u2019s spouse, then the children, and then the grandchildren. If no living family or heirs-at-law can be located, the assets will go to the state.\n\nWhile the term \u201cheir\u201d legally refers to a person who receives the property of an individual who died intestate, in common parlance, the term is often used to describe those inheriting property, as designated by a will.\n\nHowever, strictly speaking, this usage of the word is factually inaccurate, as the proper term for such an individual is a \u201cbeneficiary.\u201d The term legally defines someone who is entitled to collect the property, as prescribed by a will, trust,insurance policy, or another binding arrangement.\n\nTraditionally, Jewish, Christian, and Islamic laws each have their own sets of customs when it comes to heirs.\n\nNot all heirs are beneficiaries, such as in the case of an estranged adult child who is intentionally left out of a will. Likewise, not all beneficiaries are heirs. For example, a person can designate a friend or companion to receive property.\n\nIn the latter case, the friend is not an heir, because he would not be the recipient of property if left intestate, because he is not a child or direct relative of the decedent. However, that friend can accurately be called a beneficiary, as designated through the deceased person\u2019s will or another arrangement.\n\nA female heir is often referred to as an heiress, particularly if the inheritance involves substantialwealth.\n\nThe Rockefeller family is one of the most famous families in the world. The family\u2019s wealth was accumulated byJohn D. Rockefellerthrough his business in theoil industry. Though he gave a significant portion of his wealth to charity, his heirs were his two surviving children at the time of his death: Alta Rockefeller and John D. Rockefeller Jr.\n\nBoth children during and after Rockefeller\u2019s lifetime received a significant portion of his wealth as his heirs, wealth that hascontinued to be passed downto family members to this day. Though technically a beneficiary, as he was the only son of Rockefeller, John D. Rockefeller Jr. took over the family office and joined the family businesses. He was considered to be the heir to Rockefeller.\n\nThe British line of succession is hereditary and is passed down via bloodline from the monarch to their eldest living child, either male or female.\n\nThe current monarch is Prince Charles III, who took on the role after his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, passed away. The heir to the throne is Charles\u2019 eldest child, Prince William. After Prince William, the heir to the throne is the prince\u2019s eldest child, Prince George.\n\nAn heir is someone who is legally entitled to inherit the deceased\u2019s assets when no will is present. Heirs are typically children or other living relatives. Nations and states have laws concerning inheritance and who qualifies as an heir.\n\nAn heir is someone who is set to inherit the property of the deceased when no will or testament has been made. A beneficiary is someone who was chosen by the deceased to inherit their property, as laid out in a will or testament. An heir is typically a close living relative whereas a beneficiary can be any person or entity.\n\nChildren are considered to be heirs and are the most common example. If no children are living, then a person\u2019s grandchildren are considered to be heirs. If a person has no children or grandchildren, then the next closest living relative would be considered an heir.\n\nAn heir is someone who is entitled to the estate of a recently deceased person, most often when the deceased does not leave a will designating a beneficiary.\n\nAn heir is often the child of an individual. The term \u201cheir\u201d has commonly been associated with lines of succession, particularly in royal families. However, the term can also simply refer to any individual who will assume the estate of another individual. This can be a child, grandchild, nephew, niece, or sibling.\n\nJustia. \u201cIntestate Succession Rules\u2014The Alternative to Estate Planning.\u201d\n\nThe Royal Household. \u201cSuccession.\u201d",
