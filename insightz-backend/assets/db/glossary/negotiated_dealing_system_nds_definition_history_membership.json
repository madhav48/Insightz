While the RBI owns the NDS, it is administered by the Clearing Corporation of India Ltd. (CCIL).\n\nPrior to the NDS, the country's\u00a0government securities market was primarily telephone-based,\u00a0which meant that buyers and sellers had to place trades over the phone, submit physical Subsidiary General Ledger transfer forms, and issue checks for thesettlement of fundsto the Reserve Bank of India. These slow and inefficient\u00a0procedures led to the development and implementation of the NDS.\n\nIn August 2005, the RBI introduced the Negotiated Dealing System - Order Matching system, or NDS-OM, an electronic, screen-based, anonymous, order-driven trading system for dealing in government securities.The system is designed to bring transparency to secondary market transactions while enabling members to place bids and offers directly on the NDS-OM screen.\n\nThere are two types of NDS-OM members, including:\n\nMany other countries have similar electronic systems in place for managing government securities, money market accounts, and related securities to increase transparency and lower costs.\n\nFor more information about the Negotiated Dealing System, see the RBI'sNegotiated Dealing System Overview.\n\nThe Negotiated Dealing System consists of two modules, which are designed for different types of member institutions.\n\nReserve Bank of India. \"Retail Participation by Demat Account Holders in the Government Securities Market: Access to NDS-OM Platform.\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.\n\nCCIL. \"Milestones.\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.\n\nReserve Bank of India. \"Negotiated Dealing System (NDS).\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.",
