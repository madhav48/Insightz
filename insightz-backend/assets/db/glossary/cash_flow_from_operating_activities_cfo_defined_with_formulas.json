  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nOperating cash flow is the money that a company brings in through its core day-to-day operations.\n\nCash flow from operating activities (CFO) indicates the amount of money a company generates from its ongoing, primary business activities, such as selling products or providing services. It is the first section depicted on a company'scash flow statement.\n\nCash flow from operating activities does not include long-termcapital expendituresor investment revenue and expense. CFO focuses only on the core business, and\u00a0is also known as operating cash flow (OCF) or net cash from operating activities.\n\nCash flowforms one of the most important parts of business operations and accounts for the total amount of money being transferred into and out of a business. Since it affects the company'sliquidity, it has significance for multiple reasons. It allows business owners and operators to check where the money is coming from and going to, it helps them take steps to generate and maintain sufficient cash necessary for operational efficiency and other necessary needs, and it helps in making key and efficient financing decisions.\n\nThe details about the cash flow of a company are available in its cash flow statement, which is part of a company's quarterly andannual reports. The cash flow from operating activities depicts the cash-generating abilities of a company's core business activities. It typically includesnet incomefrom theincome statementand adjustments to modify net income from anaccrual accountingbasis to acash accountingbasis.\n\nCash availability allows a business\u00a0the option to expand, build and launch new products,buy backshares to affirm their strong financial position, pay outdividendsto reward and bolster shareholder confidence, or reduce debt to save on interest payments. Investors attempt to look for companies whose share prices are lower and whose cash flow from operations\u00a0is showing an upward trend over recent quarters. The disparity indicates that the company has increasing levels of cash flow, which, if better utilized, can lead to higher share prices in the near future.\n\nPositive (and increasing) cash flow from operating activities indicates that the core business activities of the company are thriving.\u00a0It provides as an additional measure/indicator of the profitability potential of a company, in addition to the traditional ones like net income orEBITDA.\n\nThe cash flow statement is one of the three mainfinancial statementsrequired in standard financial reporting, in addition to the income statement andbalance sheet.The cash flow statement is divided into three sections: cash flow from operating activities,cash flow from investing activities, andcash flow from financing activities. Collectively, all three sections provide a picture of where the company's cash comes from, how it is spent, and the net change in cash resulting from the firm's activities during a given accounting period.\n\nThe cash flow from investing section shows the cash used to purchase fixed and long-term assets, such asplant, property, and equipment\u00a0(PPE), as well as any proceeds from the sale of these assets. The cash flow from the financing section shows the source of a company's financing andcapital, as well as its servicing and payments on the loans. For example, proceeds from the issuance ofstocksandbonds, dividend payments, and interest payments will be included under financing activities.\n\nInvestors examine a company\u2019s cash flow from operating activities, within the cash flow statement, to determine where a company is getting its money from. In contrast to investing and financing activities, which may be one-time or sporadic revenue, the operating activities are core to the business and are recurring in nature.\n\nThe cash flow from operating activities section can be displayed on the cash flow statement in one of two ways.\n\nThe first option is theindirect method, where the company begins with net income on an accrual accounting basis and works backwards to achieve a cash basis figure for the period. Under the accrual method of accounting,revenueis recognized when earned, not necessarily when cash is received.\n\nFor example, if a customer buys a $500 widget on credit, the sale has been made, but the cash has not yet been received. The revenue is still recognized by the company in the month of the sale, and it shows up in net income on its income statement.\n\nTherefore, net income was overstated by this amount on a cash basis. The offset to the $500 of revenue would appear in the accounts receivable line item on the balance sheet. On the cash flow statement, there would need to be a reduction from net income in the amount of the $500 increase to accounts receivable due to this sale. It would be displayed on the cash flow statement as \"Increase in Accounts Receivable -$500.\"\n\nThe second option is thedirect method, in which a company records all transactions on a cash basis and displays the information on the cash flow statement using actual cash inflows and outflows during theaccounting period.\n\nExamples of the direct method of cash flows from operating activities include:\n\nMany accountants prefer the indirect method because it is simple to prepare the cash flow statement using information from the income statement and balance sheet. Most companies use the accrual method of accounting, so the income statement and balance sheet will have figures consistent with this method.\n\nTheFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)recommends that companies use the direct method as it offers a clearer picture of cash flows in and out of a business. However, as an added complexity of the direct method, the FASB also requires a business using the direct method to disclose the reconciliation ofnet income to the cash flowfrom operating activities that would have been reported if the indirect method had been used to prepare the statement.\n\nThereconciliationreport is used to check the accuracy of the cash from operating activities, and it is similar to the indirect method. The reconciliation report begins by listing the net income and adjusting it fornoncashtransactions and changes in the balance sheet accounts. This added task makes the direct method unpopular among companies.\n\nDifferent reporting standards are followed by companies as well as the different reporting entities which may lead to different calculations under the indirect method. Depending upon the available figures, the CFO value can be calculated by one of the following formulas, as both yield the same result:\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities =\u00a0Funds from Operations + Changes inWorking Capital\n\nwhere,Funds from Operations = (Net Income + Depreciation, Depletion, & Amortization + Deferred Taxes & Investment Tax Credit + Other Funds)\n\nThis format is used for reporting Cash Flow details by finance portals like\u00a0MarketWatch.\n\nCash Flow from Operating Activities =\u00a0Net Income + Depreciation, Depletion, & Amortization + Adjustments To Net Income + Changes In Accounts Receivables + Changes In Liabilities + Changes In Inventories + Changes In Other Operating Activities\n\nThis format is used for reporting Cash Flow details by finance portals like\u00a0Yahoo! Finance.\n\nAll the above-mentioned figures included above are available as standard line items in the cash flow statements of various companies.\n\nThe net income\u00a0figure comes from the\u00a0income statement. Since it is prepared on an\u00a0accrual basis, the noncash expenses recorded on the income statement, such as depreciation and amortization, are added back to the net income. In addition, any changes in balance sheet accounts are also added to or subtracted from the net income to account for the overall cash flow.\n\nInventories,\u00a0tax assets,accounts receivable, andaccrued revenueare common items of assets for which a change in value will be reflected in cash flow from operating activities.Accounts payable, tax liabilities,deferred revenue, andaccrued expensesare common examples of liabilities for which a change in value is reflected in cash flow from operations.\n\nFrom one reporting period to the next, any positive change in assets is backed out of the net income figure for cash flow calculations, while a positive change in liabilities is added back into net income for cash flow calculations.\u00a0Essentially, an increase in an asset account, such as accounts receivable, means that revenue has been recorded that has not actually been received in cash. On the other hand, an increase in a liability account, such as accounts payable, means that an expense has been recorded for which cash has not yet been paid.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the cash flow details of the leading technology company, Apple Inc. (AAPL), for thefiscal yearended September 2018. The iPhone maker had a net income of $59.53 billion, Depreciation, Depletion, & Amortization of $10.9 billion, Deferred Taxes & Investment Tax Credit of -$32.59 billion, and Other Funds of $4.9 billion.\n\nFollowing the first formula, the summation of these numbers brings the value for Fund from Operations as $42.74 billion. The net Change in Working Capital for the same period was $34.69 billion. Adding it to Fund from Operations gives the Cash Flow from Operating Activities for Apple as $77.43 billion.\n\nFor the second method, summing up the available values from Yahoo! Finance portal that reports Apple's FY 2018 Net Income $59.531 billion, Depreciation $10.903 billion, Adjustments To Net Income -$27.694 billion, Changes In Accounts Receivables -$5.322 billion, Changes In Liabilities 9.131 billion, Changes In Inventories $.828 billion, and Changes In Other Operating Activities $30.057 billion gives the net CFO value as $77.434 billion.\n\nBoth methods yield the same value.\n\nOne must note that working capital is an important component of cash flow from operations, and companies can manipulate working capital by delaying the bill payments to suppliers, accelerating the collection of bills from customers, and delaying the purchase of inventory. All these measures allow a company to retain cash. Companies also have the liberty to set their own capitalization thresholds, which allow them to set the dollar amount at which a purchase qualifies as a capital expenditure.\n\nInvestors should be aware of these considerations when comparing the cash flow of different companies. Due to such flexibility, where managers are able to manipulate these figures to a certain extent, the cash flow from operations is more commonly used for reviewing a single company's performance over two reporting periods, rather than comparing one company to another, even if the two belong in the same industry.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Beginners' Guide to Financial Statement.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 538: Accounting Periods and Methods,\" Page 10.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Apple Inc.
