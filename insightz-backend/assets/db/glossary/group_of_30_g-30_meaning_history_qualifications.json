  "term": "Group of 30 (G-30): Meaning, History, Qualifications",
  "definition": "The Group of 30, generally abbreviated to G-30, is a private, nonprofit international body composed of academic economists, company chiefs, and representatives of national, regional, andcentral banks. G-30 members meet twice a year to discuss and better understand financial andeconomicissues in the private and public sectors worldwide.\n\nThe G-30 claims its mission is to \"deepen understanding of global economic and financial issues and to explore the international repercussions of decisions taken in the public and private sectors.\"\n\nIt sets out to achieve this by meeting twice yearly in various locations, even virtually. Topics that often come up includeforeign exchange,capital markets, central banks, and\u00a0macroeconomic\u00a0issues, such as global production and labor.\n\nThe events hosted by the G-30 are invitation-only, meaning that regular members of the public are not able to attend them. However, the group has made it possible to download its publications and research for free from its website.\n\nOften, the G-30 reports generate little interest from the public due to their technical nature. That said, some of its findings have had a significant impact, including a paper it released onderivatives.\n\nAt the time, many people were skeptical of derivatives, citing a lack of understanding and the complexity of\u00a0financial securities,such as forwards, futures, options,swaps, and other similar market contracts that derive their value from an\u00a0underlying asset.\n\nAside from meeting twice a year, the G-30 also organizes study groups and seminars based on topics of mutual interest to its membership. Areas of recent focus are said to include financial reform, lessons from the financial crisis, thecredit market, and stability and growth.\n\nThe G-30 was founded in 1978 by Geoffrey Bell under the directive and initial funding from the\u00a0Rockefeller\u00a0Foundation. Before the existence of the G-30, similar aims in understanding economic issues and crises were sought by an organization called the Bellagio Group.\n\nThe Bellagio Group, formed by Austrian economist\u00a0Fritz Machlup, first met in the early 1960s to address international currency issues and the balance of payments (BOP) crisis facing the United States.\n\nThe G-30's first chair was Johannes Witteveen, the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). As of 2024, the current chair of the G-30 is\u00a0Mark Carney, former Governor of the Bank of England.\n\nThe international body's present and alumni members list reads like a who's who of international finance.\u00a0Members come from worldwide and are known for holding leadership positions in the public and private sectors. The majority of participants formerly held senior positions in central banking, while many still do.\n\nCurrent members include Paul Krugman, economist and opinion writer for the New York Times; Jean-Claude Trichet, a former president of the European Central Bank (ECB); Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England (BoE), and William Dudley, a senior research scholar for economic policy studies at Princeton University, who until 2018 was the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThe Group of 10 in economics is a group of 10 nations, which later became 11 nations, that participate in the General Arrangements to Borrow (GAB). GAB allows for a supplementary borrowing arrangement to be enacted if the IMF's resources are below a member's needs. The 11 members of the group are Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\nThe G7 is a group of seven, highly-developed and wealthy nations that come together to discuss global affairs and shape global policy. The member nations are the United States, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Japan.\n\nRussia was suspended from the G7 in 2014 when it annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe G-30 is a group of individuals from various backgrounds who seek to understand the economic and financial climate of the world and how policies impact nations and people. The group publishes its research and findings for all to share.\n\nGroup of 30. \"About the Group of 30.\"\n\nGroup of 30. \"Frequently Asked Questions.\"\n\nGroup of 30. \"Publication Details: Derivatives: Practices and Principles.\"\n\nGroup of 30. \"Emeritus Member Biography: Geoffrey L.
