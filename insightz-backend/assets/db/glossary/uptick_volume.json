  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nThe term uptick volume refers to thevolumeof shares traded while a stock price rises. It is one of many indicators used by investors to make buy\u00a0and sell\u00a0decisions.\n\nUptick volume is commonly used by traders who engage intechnical analysis\u2014the theory of using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. It is used to determine a stock's net volume\u2014the measurement of itsmomentum\u2014by subtracting the uptick volume from the downtick volume.\n\nTrading volume is an excellent indicator of how muchvolatilitythere is in the market. Uptick volume is used in trading strategies byinvestorswho are focused primarily oncharttrends instead of those who follow companyfundamentals. These investors look for the initial signs of significant momentum shifts upward\u2014the uptick volume\u2014as well as\u00a0downward shifts, which are called downtick volume.\n\nUptick volume\u00a0measures the volume of shares traded while the stock price rises. Downtick measures momentum heading downwards in a stock price, correlated with volume.\n\nInvestors look for uptick volume as evidence that a stock is in the early stages of a significant move upwards. Stock prices typically find bands ofresistancewhen both the upward and downward momentum is thwarted, making no clear trend or movement\u00a0evident. Breaking upward from thisresistance zoneis referred to as uptick volume.\n\nTechnical analysts and investors look at the uptick/downtick indicator when determining whether to buy, sell, orshorta particular stock. Investors can look at large blocks of stock traded through publicly available data and determine whether the stock is ticking up or down. This trading technique is a subset of the overall investor interest inmoney flows. Money flow calculates the average high, low, and closing price of a stock multiplied by the daily volume. Investors use that daily data to compare it to previous data in seeing whether the money flow trend is positive or negative.\n\nInvestors can use a stock's net value\u2014the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes\u2014to determine whether there's a bullish or bearish trend in the market.\n\nAs mentioned above, uptick volume indicates whether a stock willtrendupward. By contrast,downtick volumeoutlines when a stock price will reverse and drop. Just like uptick volume, downtick volume is used by analysts and investors to understandmarketmovement while predicting where it will go in the future.\n\nEssentially, the term downtick volume refers to the total number ofsharestraded at a price that is lower than the price it traded at immediately before. This metric is often used to help make predictions about whether and when the market will reverse its course.\n\nWhen used together, uptick and downtick volumes calculate a stock'snet volume\u2014the resulting difference between the two. The net volume is thetechnical indicatorthat helps investors determine whether there's abullish or bearishtrend. If the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes is positive, the net volume is bullish. By contrast, a negative result means a bearish course.\n\nAs noted earlier, uptick volume is a subset of technical analysis. This is the theory that investors employ when using charts to see movements and patterns instock pricesand volumes over time. Technical analysis is less concerned with the actual fundamentals of a particular stock and more with the movements indicating buy and sell opportunities.\n\nOn the other hand, fundamental stock analysis is, of course, very important for anyone who wants to buy and hold a solid company for many years. Fundamental analysis looks at a company\u2019s vital health statistics such ascash flow,productpipeline, and management track record. Fundamental analysis can be of less interest to day traders and others getting in and out of stocks quickly through their reliance on\u00a0technical analysis to make money.\n\nOther trading indicators such as theAccumulation Areaand theJoseph Effecthelp determine the stock price and volume momentum. Seasoned investors typically use several models simultaneously to help avoid the pitfalls offalse signalsthat often present themselves in a single model due to other activities occurring outside of that particular model.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
