Standard criteria for evaluating a country\u2019s level of development areincome per capitaor per-capita\u00a0gross domestic product, the level of industrialization, the generalstandard of living,\u00a0and the amount of technological infrastructure.\n\nNoneconomic factors, such as the Human Development Index (HDI), which quantifies a country\u2019s levels of education, literacy, and health into a single figure, can also be used to evaluate\u00a0aneconomyor\u00a0the degree of development.\n\nThe most common metric used to determine if an economy is developed or developing isper-capita gross domestic product (GDP), although no strict level exists for an economy to be considered either developing or developed. Some economists consider\u00a0$12,000 to $15,000 per-capita GDP\u00a0to be\u00a0sufficient for developed status,\u00a0while others do not consider a country developed unless its per-capita GDP is above $25,000 or $30,000. The per-capita GDP in the United States in 2023\u00a0was $82,769.\n\nFor countries that are difficult to categorize, economists turn to other factors to determine development status. Standard-of-living measures, such as the infant mortality rate andlife expectancy, are useful, although there are\u00a0no set boundaries for these measures. However, most developed economies suffer fewer than 10 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, and their citizens live to be 75 or older on average.\n\nA\u00a0high per-capita GDP alone does not confer developed economy status without other factors. For example, theUnited Nationsstill considers Qatar, with one of the world\u2019s highest per-capita GDPs in 2023 at around $80,196,\u00a0a developing economy because the nation has\u00a0extremeincome inequality, a lack ofinfrastructure, and limited educational opportunities for nonaffluent citizens.\n\nExamples of countries with developed economies\u00a0include the U.S., Canada, and most of Western Europe, including the United Kingdom and France.\n\nThe U.N.\u2019sHuman Development Index (HDI)looks at three standard-of-living criteria\u2014literacy rates, access to education, and access to healthcare\u2014and quantifies this data into a standardized figure between zero and one. Most developed countries have HDI figures above 0.8.\n\nThe United Nations, in its annual HDI rankings, reports\u00a0that in\u00a02023, Iceland had the world\u2019s highest HDI at 0.972. The United States ranked 17th\u00a0at 0.938. The top 10 countries in the HDI were Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, Germany, Sweden, Australia, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Belgium. South Sudan had the lowest HDI score, at 0.388 out of 193 countries.\n\nTerms such as \u201cemerging countries,\u201d \u201cleast developed countries,\u201d and \u201cdeveloping countries\u201d are commonly used to refer to countries that do not enjoy the same level ofeconomic security,industrialization, andgrowthas developed countries. The term \u201cThird World country\u201d to describe a state is considered archaic and offensive today.\n\nThe United Nations\u2019Conference on Trade and Developmentnotes that the world\u2019s least developed countries are \u201cdeemed highly disadvantaged in their development process, for structural, historical, and also geographical reasons\u201d and \u201cface more than other countries the risk of deeper poverty and remaining in a situation of underdevelopment.\u201d\n\nIt is often claimed by proponents ofglobalizationthat globalization is helping to lift developing economies out of poverty and onto a path of improved standards of living, higher wages, and use of modern technology. These benefits have primarily been witnessed in the Asia-Pacific region. Though globalization has not taken root in all developing economies, it has been shown to improve the economies in the ones where it has. That being said, globalization does come with drawbacks as well that need to be assessed when foreign investments flow into a developing economy.\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP Per Capita (Current U.S.$)\u2014United States.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP Per Capita (Current U.S.$)\u2014Qatar.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations. \u201cWorld Economic Situation and Prospects 2025.\u201d Page 144.
