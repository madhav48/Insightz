  "term": "Tokyo Price Index (TOPIX): What it is, Sector Indices",
  "definition": "The Tokyo Price Index\u2014commonly referred to as TOPIX\u2014is a metric for stock prices on theTokyo Stock Exchange(TSE). TOPIX is acapitalization-weighted indexthat\u00a0lists all firms in the \"first section\" of the TSE, a section that organizes all large firms on the exchange into one group. The second section of the TSE pools all of the smaller remaining companies.\n\nThe Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the largest stockexchangein Japan and is responsible for calculating and publishing the TOPIX. Compared to theNikkei, or Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the TOPIX is considered a more appropriate representation of all the Japanese stock markets because it reflects a fairer depiction of price changes and includes\u00a0the largest companies trading on the TSE. In comparison, the Nikkei is weighted by price and is composed of only the top 225blue chipcompanies listed on the TSE.\n\nTOPIX shows the currentmarket capitalizationof\u00a0companies assuming that market capitalization as of the base date (Jan.\u00a04, 1968) is 100 points. The measure is used to determine the overall trend in the stock market\u00a0and is used as abenchmarkfor investors.\n\nThesectorindices of TOPIX\u00a0are composed\u00a0ofindicescreated by dividing the constituents of TOPIX into 33 categories. These categories are determined according to the industrial sectors defined by the Securities Identification Code Committee. They include but are not limited to, construction, textiles and apparels, nonferrous metals, machinery, electric power and gas, land and air transportation, retail trade, banks, securities and commodity futures, real estate, insurance, agriculture and forestry, pharmaceuticals, and\u00a0iron and steel.\n\nTOPIX has somesubindicesthat are also published by the TSE. These include but are not limited to, the TOPIX New Index Series, size-based TOPIX subindices, TOPIX sector indices, the Tokyo Stock Exchange Composite Index Series, the Tokyo Stock Exchange Dividend Focus 100 Index, the Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Property Sector Index Series, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index.\n\nIn\u00a0a series of three phases, TOPIX transitioned from a system that weighted companies based on a collective total figure ofoutstanding sharesto a system that weights companies based on the total number of shares available for\u00a0trade. This is known as afree float. TOPIX\u2019s transition began in 2005 and was completed in the summer of 2006.\n\nAlthough this transition is, essentially, a technicality, it has had a substantial impact on the actual weight of companies listed in the index. This is because a large majority of companies in Japan also have significantholdingsof shares in\u00a0their business partners to maintain sophisticated and strong business alliances, and these\u00a0shares are no longer included in the index's company weight calculation.\n\nThe Japanese practice of business partners having close relationships with one another and sometimes taking equity stakes in each other is calledkeiretsu, which translated literally means \"headless combine.\"\n\nOne of several TOPIX indices is theTOPIX Core 30 Index. The capitalization-weighted index tracks the performance of 30 stocks in the TOPIX index that have large market capitalizations and are themost liquid.\u00a0The index started on April 1, 1998 with a base value of 1,000. The list of companies in the TOPIX Core 30 include some of Japan's most well-known names, such as Honda Motor, Canon, Mitsubishi Corp., Sony, and Toyota Motor.\n\nInvestors cannot directly purchase an index. However, there areexchange traded funds(ETFs) that enable investors to invest in a basket of securities that tracks the performance of the TOPIX. The Nomura Asset Management Company runs the TOPIX Core 30 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The fund's investment objective is to construct a portfolio that is similar in composition to the TOPIX Core 30, providing corresponding price andyieldperformance.",
