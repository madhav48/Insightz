  "term": "Erosion: What it is, How it Works, Types",
  "definition": "Erosion can include any negative impact on a company\u2019s associated assets or funds. Erosion can be experienced with regard to profits, sales,\u00a0or tangible assets, such as manufacturing equipment. Erosion is often considered a general risk factor within an organization\u2019s cash management system, as the losses may be slow and occurring over time.\n\nErosion can also occur with certain financial assets, such asoptionscontracts orwarrantsthat decline in value as time passes\u2014known astime decay.\n\nErosion most often applies to longer-term downward trends, especially those that seem to be accelerating. In other words, erosion implies a permanent change in business conditions. Short-term losses are not categorized as erosion but listed asone-time chargesor nonrecurrent losses. Standard anticipated depreciation, or the cyclical nature of certain product sales, are often considered a normal part ofbusinessfunctions. These are more likely to be referred to as downward trends.\n\nProfit erosion can refer to the gradual redirection of funds from profitable segments or projects within a business to new projects and areas. Although managers almost always consider money flowing into new projects asinvestmentsinlong-term growth, the short-term effect is a slow erosion ofcash flow. Cash flow is the amount of cash that flows in and out of a company as a result of its day-to-day business operations.\n\nThe risk involved in profit erosion is usually reflected in the company\u2019sprofit margins, as the monies are used to fund areas that may or may not be profitable in the future. Profit margin is the percentage of sales that has generated profits.\n\nAdditionally, profit erosion can occur even when sales numbers are comparable to previous levels. This can occur when the cost of producing a particular product rises, possibly due to increases in the costs of materials or labor, but the sales price of the product is not raised to compensate.\n\nCertain assets lose value over time; a process often referred to asdepreciation. Though much asset depreciation is accounted for within the business\u2019s figures, unexpected asset erosion can still occur. These losses can materialize due to the general use of equipment or technological advances that make the current assets less valuable or obsolete.\n\nAsset erosion can lower the perceived value of the business as a whole, as it lowers thebook valueof the assets associated with the company. Intangible assets such as patents or trademarks, which have an expiration date, also have their value eroded over time, especially as that date nears. For pharmaceuticals companies, generic producers entering the market can lead to erosion of their offerings and be a real issue of concern.Amortizationis the regular accounting process whereby intangible assets' values are reduced over time.\n\nOptions contracts are derivatives, meaning their value is determined by an underlying asset. Options on stocks that have been issued to company managers or employees can erode in value over time. Options contracts typically come with an expiration date, where the rights embedded in those contracts must be exercised prior to expiration. As the expiration date approaches, thetime-valuein those contracts erodes in a process known as time decay. In other words, as time passes, there's less chance to earn a profit from the option\u2013if it's not already profitable. As a result, the value of options decreases or erodes over time.\n\nEmployee stock options have become a large balance sheet item for many large companies, and so this form of value loss is important in analyzing financial statements.\n\nSales erosion refers to the process of steady, long-term declines in overall sales numbers. These differ from temporary sales declines because these losses are often considered fairly widespread, possibly qualifying as a long-term trend within the business\u2019s activities.\n\nSales erosion can be experienced due to a number of factors, including new entries into that particular product\u2019s market, or price undercutting on behalf of the competition. Technology advances in the field can also lead to sales erosion if newer product developments make the current company offering seem obsolete.",
