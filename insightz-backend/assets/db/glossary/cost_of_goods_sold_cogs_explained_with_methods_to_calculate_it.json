  "definition": "Cost of goods sold (COGS) refers to the direct costs of producing the goods sold by a company. This amount includes the cost of the materials and labor directly used to create the good. It excludes indirect expenses, such as distribution costs and sales force costs.\n\nCost of goods sold is also referred to as \"cost of sales.\"\n\nCOGS is an important metric on financial statements as it is subtracted from a company\u2019s revenues to determine itsgross profit. Gross profit is a profitability measure that evaluates how efficient a company is in managing its labor and supplies in the production process.\n\nBecause COGS is acost of doing business, it is recorded as a business expense on income statements. Knowing the cost of goods sold helps analysts, investors, and managers estimate a company\u2019s bottom line. If COGS increases, net income will decrease. While this movement is beneficial for income tax purposes, the business will have less profit for its shareholders. Businesses thus try to keep their COGS low so that net profits will be higher.\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is thecost of acquiring or manufacturing the productsor finished goods that a company then sells during a period, so the only costs included in the measure are those that are directly tied to the production of the products, including thecost of labor, materials, and manufacturing overhead.\n\nFor example, COGS for an automaker would includethe material costsfor the parts that go into making the car plus the labor costs used to put the car together. The cost of sending the cars to dealerships and the cost of the labor used to sell the car would be excluded.\n\nFurthermore, costs incurred on the cars that were not sold during the year will not be included when calculating COGS, whether the costs are direct or indirect. In other words, COGS includes the direct cost of producing goods or services that were purchased by customers during the year. As a rule of thumb, if you want to know if an expense falls under COGS, ask: \"Would this expense have been an expense even if no sales were generated?\"\n\nCOGS only applies to those costs directly related to producing goods intended for sale.\n\nCOGS=Beginning\u00a0Inventory+P\u2212Ending\u00a0InventorywhereP=Purchases\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0period\\begin{aligned} &\\text{COGS}=\\text{Beginning Inventory}+\\text{P}-\\text{Ending Inventory}\\\\ &\\textbf{where}\\\\ &\\text{P}=\\text{Purchases during the period}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bCOGS=Beginning\u00a0Inventory+P\u2212Ending\u00a0InventorywhereP=Purchases\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0period\u200b\n\nInventory that is sold appears in theincome statementunder the COGS account.The beginning inventory for the year is the inventory left over from the previous year\u2014that is, themerchandisethat was not sold in the previous year.\n\nAny additional productions or purchases made by a manufacturing or retail company are added to the beginning inventory. At the end of the year, the products that were not sold are subtracted from the sum of beginning inventory and additional purchases. The final number derived from the calculation is the cost of goods sold for the year.\n\nThe balance sheet has an account called the current assets account. Under this account is an item called inventory. The balance sheet only captures a company\u2019sfinancial healthat the end of an accounting period. This means that the inventory value recorded under current assets is the ending inventory.\n\nThe value of the cost of goods sold depends on the inventory valuation method adopted by a company. There are three methods that a company can use when recording the level of inventory sold during a period:first in, first out (FIFO), last in, first out (LIFO), and the average cost method. The special identification method is used for high-ticket or unique items.\n\nThe earliest goods to be purchased or manufactured are sold first. Since prices tend to go up over time, a company that uses theFIFOmethod will sell its least expensive products first, which translates to a lower COGS than the COGS recorded under LIFO. Hence, thenet incomeusing the FIFO method increases over time.\n\nLIFOis where the latest goods added to the inventory are sold first. During periods of rising prices, goods with higher costs are sold first, leading to a higher COGS amount. Over time, the net income tends to decrease.\n\nThe average price of all the goods in stock, regardless of purchase date, is used to value the goods sold. Taking theaverage product costover a time period has a smoothing effect that prevents COGS from being highly impacted by the extreme costs of one or more acquisitions or purchases.\n\nThe special identification method uses the specific cost of each unit of merchandise (also called inventory or goods) to calculate the ending inventory and COGS for each period. In this method, a business knows precisely which item was sold andthe exact cost. Further, this method is typically used in industries that sell unique items like cars, real estate, and rare and precious jewels.\n\nMany service companies do not have any cost of goods sold at all. COGS is not addressed in any detail ingenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but COGS is defined as only the cost of inventory items sold during a given period. Not only do service companies have no goods to sell, but purely service companies also do not have inventories. If COGS is not listed on a company's income statement, no deduction can be applied for those costs.\n\nExamples of pure service companies include accounting firms, law offices, real estate\u00a0appraisers, business consultants, and professional dancers, among others. Even though all of these industries have\u00a0business expenses\u00a0and normally spend money to provide their services, they do not list COGS. Instead, they have what is called \"cost of services,\" which does not count towards a COGS deduction.\n\nCosts of revenueexist for ongoing contract services that can include raw materials, direct labor, shipping costs, and commissions paid to sales employees. These items cannot be claimed as COGS without a physically produced product to sell, however. The IRS website even lists some examples of \"personal service businesses\" that do not calculate COGS on their income statements. These include doctors, lawyers, carpenters, and painters.\n\nMany service-based companies have some products to sell. For example, airlines and hotels are primarily providers of services such as transport and lodging, respectively, yet they also sell gifts, food, beverages, and other items. These items are definitely considered goods, and these companies certainly have inventories of such goods. Both of these industries can list COGS on their income statements and claim them for tax purposes.\n\nBothoperatingexpenses\u00a0and cost of goods sold\u00a0(COGS) are expenditures that companies\u00a0incur with running their business; however, the expenses are segregated\u00a0on the income statement. Unlike COGS,operating expenses\u00a0(OPEX)are expenditures that are\u00a0not directly tied to\u00a0the production of goods or services.\n\nTypically,SG&A (selling, general, and administrative expenses) are\u00a0included under operating expenses as a separate line item. SG&A expenses are expenditures, such as overhead costs,\u00a0that are not directly tied to a\u00a0product. Examples of operating expenses\u00a0include the following:\n\nWhile these terms are often used interchangeably, there's a subtledifference between the two. COGS specifically refers to the direct costs associated with producing goods or acquiring inventory that has been sold during a particular period. By contrast, COS includes not only the direct costs of goods sold but also other costs directly related to generating revenue, such as direct labor and direct overhead. Essentially, COS encompasses a broader range of expenses than COGS, as it may include additional costs associated with delivering the product or service to the customer.\n\nCOGS can easily be manipulated by accountants or managers looking to cook the books. It can be altered by:\n\nWhen inventory is artificially inflated, COGS will be under-reported which, in turn, will lead to a higher-than-actual gross profit margin, and hence, an inflated net income.\n\nInvestors looking through a company\u2019s financial statements can spot unscrupulous inventory accounting by checking for inventory buildup, such as inventory rising faster than revenue or total assets reported.\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS) is calculated by adding up the various direct costs required to generate a company\u2019s revenues. Importantly, COGS is based only on the costs that aredirectlyutilized in producing that revenue, such as the company\u2019s inventory or labor costs that can be attributed to specific sales. By contrast, fixed costs such as managerial salaries, rent, and utilities are not included in COGS. Inventory is a particularly important component of COGS, and accounting rules permit several different approaches for how to include it in the calculation.\n\nCost of Goods Sold represents the direct costs attributable to the production of goods sold by a company. It includes various costs directly associated with the production or acquisition of the goods that a company sells during a specific period. These costs typically include:\n\nCOGS does not include salaries and other general and administrative expenses; however, certain types of labor costs can be included in COGS, provided that they can be directly associated with specific sales. For example, a company that uses contractors to generate revenues might pay those contractors a commission based on the price charged to the customer. In that scenario, the commission earned by the contractors might be included in the company\u2019s COGS, since that labor cost is directly connected to the revenues being generated.\n\nIn theory, COGS should include the cost of all inventory that was sold during the accounting period. In practice, however, companies often don\u2019t know exactly which units of inventory were sold. Instead, they rely on accounting methods such as the first in, first out (FIFO) and last in, first out (LIFO) rules to estimate what value of inventory was actually sold in the period. If the inventory value included in COGS is relatively high, then this will place downward pressure on the company\u2019s gross profit. For this reason, companies sometimes choose accounting methods that will produce a lower COGS figure, in an attempt to boost their reported profitability.\n\nCost of goods sold is the direct cost of producing a good, which includes the cost of the materials and labor used to create the good. COGS directly impacts a company's profits as COGS is subtracted from revenue. Companies must manage their COGS to ensure higher profits. If a company can reduce its COGS through better deals with suppliers or through more efficiency in the production process, it can be more profitable.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 535 (2022), Business Expenses.\"\n\nMitchell Franklin, Patty Graybeal, and Dixon Cooper. \"Principles of Accounting, Volume 1: Financial Accounting,\" Pages 373 and 407.\n\nMitchell Franklin, Patty Graybeal, and Dixon Cooper. \"Principles of Accounting, Volume 1: Financial Accounting,\" Pages 652-654.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 334: Tax Guide for Small Business,\" Page 27.\n\nMitchell Franklin, Patty Graybeal, and Dixon Cooper. \"Principles of Accounting, Volume 1: Financial Accounting,\" Page 405.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 334: Tax Guide for Small Business,\" Pages 28-29.",
