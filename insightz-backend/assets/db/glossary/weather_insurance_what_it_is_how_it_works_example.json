  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nThe term weatherinsurancerefers to a form of financial protection against losses or damages incurred because of adverse, measurable weather conditions. These conditions generally include wind, snow, rain/thunderstorms, fog, and undesirable temperatures.\n\nWeather insurance as a separate policy is commonly used to protectbusinessesand their related activities. As such, these policies serve various purposes, such as insuring an expensive event that could be ruined by bad weather. Insurers cover insured entities if weather conditions cause a loss ofrevenuefrom events.\n\nWeather influences our daily lives and can have a huge impact on corporate revenues andearnings. So, weather insurance, taken out in a standalone insurance policy, is commonly used to protectbusinessesand their related activities\u2014such as insuring an expensive event that could be ruined or severely impacted by bad weather.Weather insurance can cover events like festivals, concerts, trade shows, seasonal events, parades, film shoots, fundraisers, and sporting events.But it can also be used by individuals to cover major celebrations, such as an outdoor wedding.\n\nConventional weather insurance generally includes coverage for low-probability meteorological events, including hurricanes, earthquakes, and tornados. Insurers would offer reimbursement if weather conditions cause a loss ofrevenuefrom events, or the cancellation of them outright.\n\nThepremiumfor weather insurance is based on several factors, including the location and time of year. In other words, the dollar amount clients are charged for coverage is determined by the likelihood of the insured weather event occurring and the amount of potential loss. Anactuaryat the insurance company looks at weather data going back many decades to decide how to price a policy. If, for example, Cleveland gets a white Christmas every 10 years, then the insurer knows that the probability of such an event is 10%, and would set premium rates accordingly.\n\nWeather insurance is a necessity for many companies and is considered to be a keyrisk managementstrategy. It\u2019s also highly customizable. For example, an insured party can choose the number of days, weather events, and severity of weather that will be covered by the policy.\n\nBusinesses sometimes even use these policies as a sales gimmick to lure in customers. For instance, a furniture store may\u00a0advertise that all buyers of furniture in December will get their purchases free if it snows more than two inches on Christmas. In such cases, the store would buy a policy to cover this specific event.\n\nProtection against losses caused by adverse weather conditions is covered to a certain degree by other types of insurance policies, such ashomeowners insurance,property insurance, or special event insurance.\n\nLet's say an event planner is organizing an outdoor festival for a weekend in the summer. Although they sell tickets to the festival itself, the event organizer also expects to earn revenue from sales of food, drinks, and products\u2014a cut of what various vendors are offering. The organizer sets the date but is unsure about whether weather conditions will cooperate.\n\nIn order to make sure there are no hiccups during the festival, the organizer decides to take out a weather insurance policy. If the festival gets a poor turnout due to rain, the organizer can file aninsurance claimwith the insurance company to make up lost revenue, provided premiums are paid up.\n\nUntil recently, insurance has been the main tool used by companies\u00a0for protection against unexpected weather conditions. The problem is that conventional insurance usually only provides coverage forcatastrophic damageand does nothing to protect against the reduced demand businesses experience as a result of weather that is warmer or colder than expected.\n\nPercent of the U.S. economy that is directly affected by the weather.\n\nEnterweather derivatives. They provide protection of a sort, but they are not insurance\u2014rather, they are financial\u00a0instruments used by companies or individuals tohedgeagainst the risk of weather-related losses. The seller of\u00a0a weather derivative agrees to bear the\u00a0risk of disasters in return for a premium. That means that if no damages occur before the expiration of the contract, they end up making aprofit. In the event of unexpected or adverse weather, they pay the buyer of\u00a0the derivative the agreed-upon amount reimbursement.\n\nIn the late 1990s, people began to realize if they quantified and indexed weather in terms of monthly or seasonal average temperatures\u00a0and attached a dollar amount to eachindexvalue, they could \"package\" and trade the weather. The very first transaction of the sort was conducted in 1997 in a power contract by Aquila Energy.\n\nFrom here, the weather became a tradablecommodity, comparable to trading the varying values of\u00a0stock indices,currencies,\u00a0interest rates,\u00a0and agricultural commodities.\n\nWeather derivatives usuallycover low-risk, high-probability events. Weather insurance, on the other hand, typically protects against high-risk, low-probability occurrences, as defined in a highly\u00a0customized\u00a0policy.\u00a0Because weather insurance and derivatives deal with two different possibilities, a company might have an interest in purchasing\u00a0both.\n\nVortex Insurance Agency. \"Understanding Weather Insurance.\" Accessed Jun. 16, 2021.\n\nAllen Financial Insurance Group. \"Weather Insurance \u2014 Event Insurance \u2014 Rain Insurance.\" Accessed Jun. 16, 2021.\n\nInsurance Information Institute. \"Special event insurance.\" Accessed Jun. 16 2021.\n\nChicago Mercantile Exchange. \"An Introduction to CME Weather Products,\" Page 2.
