It is based on credit history: number of open accounts, total levels of debt, repayment history, and other factors. The higher the score, the better a borrower looks to potential lenders, because lenders use credit scores to evaluate the probability that an individual will repay loans in a timely manner.\n\nInterest is the monetary charge for borrowing money\u2014generally expressed as a percentage, such as an annual percentage rate (APR). Interest is the amount of money a lender or financial institution receives for lending out money. And interest can also refer to the amount of ownership a stockholder has in a company, usually expressed as a percentage.\n\nA cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.

Generally, as of March 2022, cryptocurrencies are not issued by any central authority, rendering them theoretically immune to government interference or manipulation.\n\nDiversification is a risk management strategy where one chooses a variety of investments for their portfolio. A diversified portfolio contains a mix of distinct asset types, such as stocks and bonds, in an attempt at limiting exposure to any single asset or risk. The idea is that different kinds of assets will, on average, yield higher long-term returns and lower the risk of any individual holding or security.\n\nAn asset class is a group of investments that have similar characteristics and are subject to the same laws and regulations. Historically, the three main asset classes have been equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), and cash equivalent or money market instruments.\n\nAn import is a good or service that was produced in one country, and bought in another one. Imports, along with exports, are one of the key components of international trade. If the value of a country's imports exceeds the value of its exports, the country has a negative balance of trade, also known as a trade deficit.\n\nThe term \"security\" in finance refers to a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. Securities are used to raise capital in public and private markets. The primary types of securities are equity\u2014which provides ownership rights to holders\u2014debt, and hybrids, which combine aspects of debt and equity.\n\nA mobile wallet stores credit card or debit card information on a mobile device like your phone, a tablet, or smartwatch. With a mobile wallet, one can buy things online or in stores more easily.

It is calculated on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Compounding multiplies money at an accelerated rate and the greater the number of compounding periods, the greater the compound interest will be.\n\nConsumer debt includes personal debts that are owed as a result of purchasing goods that are used for individual or household consumption. Examples of consumer debt include credit card debt, student loans, auto loans, mortgages, and payday loans. These can be extended by a bank, the federal government, and credit unions.\n\nFintech, or financial technology, is used to describe new technology that seeks to improve and simplify the delivery and use of financial services.
