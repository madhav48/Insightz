  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe term \"American dream\" refers to the belief that anyone, regardless of where they were born or their socio-economic status, can attain their own version of success in a society in which upward mobility is possible for everyone.\n\nThe American dream is believed to be achieved through sacrifice, risk-taking, and hard work, rather than by chance.\n\nThe term was coined by writer and historian\u00a0James Truslow Adams in his best-selling 1931 book \"Epic of America.\"\u00a0He described it as \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.\"\n\nAdams went on to explain:\u00a0\"It is a difficult dream for the European upper classes to interpret adequately, and too many of us ourselves have grown weary and mistrustful of it. It is not a dream of motorcars and high wages merely, but a dream of social order in which each man and woman shall be able to attain to the fullest stature of which they are innately capable, and be recognized by others for what they are, regardless of the fortuitous circumstances of birth or position.\"\n\nThe idea of the American dream has much deeper roots. Its tenets\u00a0can be found in the Declaration of Independence, which states: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d\n\nIn a society based on these principles, an individual can live life to its fullest as they define it. America also grew mostly as a nation of immigrants who created a nation where becoming an American\u2014and passing that citizenship to your children\u2014didn't require being the child of an American.\n\nAchieving the American dream requires political and economic freedom, as well as rules of law and privateproperty rights. Without them, individuals cannot make the choices that will permit them to attain success, nor can they have confidence that their achievements will not be taken away from them through arbitrary force.\n\nThe American dream promises freedom and equality. It offers the freedom to make both the large and small decisions that affect one\u2019s life, the freedom to aspire to bigger and better things and the possibility of achieving them, the freedom to accumulate wealth, the opportunity to lead a dignified life, and the freedom to live in accordance with one\u2019s values\u2014even if those values are not widely held or accepted.\n\nThe\u00a0books of post-Civil War writer Horatio Alger, in which impoverished but hardworking teenage boys rise to success through pluck, determination, andgood fortune, came to personify realizing the dream.\n\nThe American dream also offers the promise that the circumstances of someone's birth\u2014including whether they were born American citizens or immigrants\u2014do not completely determine their future.\n\nTerming the concept a \"dream\" also carries with it the notion that these ideals aren't necessarily what has played out in the lives of many actual Americans and those who hope to become Americans. The criticism that reality falls short of theAmerican dreamis at least as old as the idea itself. The spread of settlers into Native American lands, slavery, the original limitation of the right to vote to white male landowners, and a long list of other injustices and challenges have undermined the realization of the dream for many who live in the United States.\n\nAs income inequality has increased substantially since the 1970s, the American dream has begun to seem less attainable for those who aren't already affluent or born into affluence. According to U.S. Census family income data, real family income began to grow much more among the top income group than among other segments of American society.\n\nThese realities, however, do not diminish the luster of the American dream as an ideal and a beacon to all nations.\n\nThe American dream promises freedom and equality.\n\nThe ideals of the American dream are motivating, including the freedom to be in charge of one's own life.\n\nThe reality of the American dream often falls short of the idea itself.\n\nAs income inequality has increased, the American dream has seemed less attainable.\n\nToday, homeownership is frequently cited as an example of attaining the American dream. It is a symbol of financial success and independence, and it means the ability to control one\u2019s own dwelling place instead of being subject\u00a0to the whims of a landlord.\n\nOwning a business and being one\u2019s own boss also represents the American dream fulfillment.Entrepreneurship has always been importantto the U.S. economy, too. From 1995 to 2021, small businesses created 17.3 million net jobs alone.\n\nIn addition, access to education and healthcare have\u00a0been cited as elements of the dream.\n\nIn her book \"Spreading the American Dream: American Economic and Cultural Expansion, 1890-1945,\" sociologist Emily S. Rosenberg identifies five components of the American dream that have shown up in countries around the world. These include the following:\n\nThe American dream was aided by a number of factors that gave the United States acompetitive advantageover other countries. For starters, it is relatively isolated geographically, compared to many other countries, and enjoys a temperate climate. It has a culturally diverse population that businesses use to foster innovation in a global landscape. Abundant natural resources\u2014including oil, arable land,\u00a0and\u00a0long coastlines\u2014generate food and income for the country and its residents.\n\nThe phrase \u201cAmerican dream\u201d was often used by Progressive-era reformers of the 1900s. Rather than exalting the pursuit of wealth, they sought to tame monopoly capitalism and protect workers and communities from robber barons.This concept was popularized by writer and historian\u00a0James Truslow Adams in his best-selling 1931 book \"Epic of America.\"\u00a0He described it as \"that dream of a land in which life should be better and richer and fuller for everyone, with opportunity for each according to ability or achievement.\"\n\nExamples of the American dream include owning your own house, starting a family, and having a stable job or owning your own business.\n\nIt's widely debated if the American dream is still achievable, and what that achievement even entails. Indeed, today, many people wonder if they can keep up with rising housing costs and interest payments on loans needed to purchase things like homes and cars. Moreover, American's need to save for their own retirement and pay large out-of-pocket costs for healthcare and higher education, which can leave families saddled with high-interest debt that is hard to crawl back from.\n\nOver time, the American dream has shifted from an ethos of equality and solidarity to one of individualistic competition to succeed materialistically, fueled by consumption. In the 1990s and early 2000s, mortgage company Fannie Mae began promulgating the notion that buying a home was a cornerstone of the American dream, and use the term prominently in ads selling home loans.This ideology led to the housing boom and ultimate bubble that popped ultimately, leading to the 2008-09 financial crisis.\n\nThe concept of the American dream is still one of the most uniquely \"American\" ideals\u2014the ultimate idea that any individual should be able to pursue their dreams and build the life they want if they put in the hard work.\n\nThis motivating driveinfluences the economywith entrepreneurship and individual ambition, infusing a romantic notion to anyone trying to be successful in the United States. Though the definition of the American dream has changed to meandifferent things to different generations, it's undoubtedly part of the American ethos.\n\nJames Truslow Adams. \"The Epic of America.\" Page 404.
