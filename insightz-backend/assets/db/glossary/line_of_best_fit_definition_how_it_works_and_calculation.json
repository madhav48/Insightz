  "term": "Line of Best Fit: Definition, How It Works, and Calculation",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nLine of best fit refers to a line through a scatter plot of data points that best expresses the relationship between those points. Statisticians typically use the least squares method (sometimes known as ordinary least squares, or OLS) to arrive at the geometric equation for the line, either through manual calculations or by using software.\n\nA straight line will result from a simplelinear regressionanalysis of two or more independent variables. Amultiple regressioninvolving several related variables can produce a curved line in some cases.\n\nThe line of best fit estimates a straight line that minimizes the distance between itself and where observations fall in some dataset. The line of best fit is used to show a trend or correlation between the dependent variable and independent variable(s). It can be depicted visually, or as a mathematical expression.\n\nLine of best fit is one of the most important concepts inregressionanalysis. Regression refers to a quantitative measure of the relationship between one or more independent variables and a resulting dependent variable. Regression is of use to professionals in a wide range of fields, from science and public service to financial analysis.\n\nTo perform a regression analysis, a statistician collects a set of data points, each including a complete set of dependent and independent variables. For example, the dependent variable could be a firm\u2019s stock price and the independent\u00a0variables could be theStandard and Poor\u2019s (S&P) 500Index and the national unemployment rate, assuming that the stock is not listed in the S&P 500. The sample set could be each of these three datasets for the past 20 years.\n\nOn a chart, these data points would appear as a scatter plot, a set of points that may or may not appear to be organized along any line. If a linear pattern is apparent, it may be possible to sketch a line of best fit that minimizes the distance of those points from that line. If no organizing axis is visually apparent, regression analysis can generate a line based on theleast squares method. This method builds the line that minimizes the squared distance of each point from the line of best fit.\n\nTo determine the formula for this line, the statistician enters these three results for the past 20 years into a regression software application. The software produces a linear formula that expresses the causal relationship among the S&P 500, the unemployment rate, and the stock price of the company in question. This equation is the formula for the line of best fit. It is a predictive tool, providing analysts and traders with a mechanism to project the firm\u2019s future stock price based on those two independent variables.\n\nA regression with two independent variables such as the example discussed above will produce a formula with this basic structure:\n\nIn this equation, y is the dependent variable, c is a constant, b1is the first regression coefficient, and x1is the first independent variable. The second coefficient and second independent variable are b2and x2,respectively. Drawing from the above example, the stock price would be y, the S&P 500 would be x1,and the unemployment rate would be x2. The coefficient of each independent variable represents the degree of change in y for each additional unit in that variable.\n\nIf the S&P 500 increases by one, the resulting y or share price will go up by the amount of the coefficient. The same is true for the second independent variable, the unemployment rate. In a simple regression with one independent variable, that coefficient is the slope of the line of best fit. In this example or any regression with two independent variables, the slope is a mix of the two coefficients. The constant c is the y-intercept of the line of best fit.\n\nThere are several approaches to estimating a line of best fit to some data. The simplest, and crudest, involves visually estimating such a line on a scatter plot and drawing it in to your best ability.\n\nThe more precise method involves the least squares method. This is a statistical procedure to find the best fit for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the plotted curve. This is the primary technique used in regression analysis.\n\nBy definition, a line is always straight, so a best-fit line is linear. However, a curve may also be used to describe the best fit in a set of data. Indeed, a best-fit curve may be squared (x2), cubic (x3), quadratic (x4), logarithmic (ln), a square root (\u221a), or anything else that can be described mathematically with an equation. Note, however, that simpler explanations of fit are often preferred.\n\nFor financial analysts, the method of estimating a line of best fit can help to quantify the relationship between two or more variables\u2014such as a stock\u2019s share price and itsearnings per share (EPS). By performing this type of analysis, investors often try to predict the future behavior of stock prices or other factors by extrapolating that line out in time.\n\nA line of best fit estimates the one line that minimizes the distance between it and observed data. Estimating a line of best fit is a key component of regression analysis in statistics in order to infer the relationships between some dependent variable and one or more explanatory variables. In finance, the line of best fit is utilized in this way to conducteconometricstudies and in certain tools used intechnical analysis.",
