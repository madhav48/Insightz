  "term": "Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL)",
  "definition": "The degree of operating leverage (DOL) is a multiple that measures how much theoperating incomeof a company will change in response to a change in sales. Companies with a large proportion offixed costs(or costs that don't change with production) tovariable costs(costs that change with production volume) have higher levels of operating leverage.\n\nThe DOL ratio assists analysts in determining the impact of any change in sales on companyearningsor profit.\n\n\ufeffDOL=%change\u00a0inEBIT%change\u00a0in\u00a0saleswhere:EBIT=earnings\u00a0before\u00a0income\u00a0and\u00a0taxes\\begin{aligned} &DOL = \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in }EBIT}{\\% \\text{ change in sales}} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &EBIT=\\text{earnings before income and taxes}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bDOL=%change\u00a0in\u00a0sales%change\u00a0inEBIT\u200bwhere:EBIT=earnings\u00a0before\u00a0income\u00a0and\u00a0taxes\u200b\ufeff\n\nThere are a number of alternative ways to calculate the DOL, each based on the primary formula given above:\n\n\ufeffDegree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=change\u00a0in\u00a0operating\u00a0incomechanges\u00a0in\u00a0sales\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\frac{\\text{change in operating income}}{\\text{changes in sales}}Degree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=changes\u00a0in\u00a0saleschange\u00a0in\u00a0operating\u00a0income\u200b\ufeff\n\n\ufeffDegree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=contribution\u00a0marginoperating\u00a0income\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\frac{\\text{contribution margin }}{\\text{operating income}}Degree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=operating\u00a0incomecontribution\u00a0margin\u200b\ufeff\n\n\ufeffDegree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=sales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0variable\u00a0costssales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0variable\u00a0costs\u00a0\u2013\u00a0fixed\u00a0costs\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\frac{\\text{sales -- variable costs}}{\\text{sales -- variable costs -- fixed costs}}Degree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=sales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0variable\u00a0costs\u00a0\u2013\u00a0fixed\u00a0costssales\u00a0\u2013\u00a0variable\u00a0costs\u200b\ufeff\n\n\ufeffDegree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=contribution\u00a0margin\u00a0percentageoperating\u00a0margin\\text{Degree of operating leverage} = \\frac{\\text{contribution margin percentage}}{\\text{operating margin}}Degree\u00a0of\u00a0operating\u00a0leverage=operating\u00a0margincontribution\u00a0margin\u00a0percentage\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe higher the degree of operating leverage (DOL), the more sensitive a company\u2019searnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)are to changes in sales, assuming all other variables remain constant. The DOL ratio helps analysts determine what the impact of any change in sales will be on the company\u2019s earnings.\n\nOperating leveragemeasures a company\u2019s fixed costs as a percentage of its total costs. It is used to evaluate a business\u2019 breakeven point\u2014which is where sales are high enough to pay for all costs, and the profit is zero.A company withhigh operating leveragehas a large proportion of fixed costs\u2014which means that a big increase in sales can lead to outsized changes in profits. A company withlow operating leveragehas a large proportion of variable costs\u2014which means that it earns a smaller profit on each sale, but does not have to increase sales as much to cover its lower fixed costs.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, say Company X has $500,000 in sales in year one and $600,000 in sales in year two. In year one, the company's operating expenses were $150,000, while in year two, the operating expenses were $175,000.\n\n\ufeffYear\u00a0oneEBIT=$500,000\u2212$150,000=$350,000Year\u00a0twoEBIT=$600,000\u2212$175,000=$425,000\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Year one }EBIT = \\$500,000 - \\$150,000 = \\$350,000 \\\\ &\\text{Year two }EBIT = \\$600,000 - \\$175,000 = \\$425,000 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bYear\u00a0oneEBIT=$500,000\u2212$150,000=$350,000Year\u00a0twoEBIT=$600,000\u2212$175,000=$425,000\u200b\ufeff\n\nNext, the percentage change in the EBIT values and the percentage change in the sales figures are calculated as:\n\n\ufeff%change\u00a0inEBIT=($425,000\u00f7$350,000)\u22121=21.43%%change\u00a0in\u00a0sales=($600,000\u00f7$500,000)\u22121=20%\\begin{aligned} \\% \\text{ change in }EBIT &= (\\$425,000 \\div \\$350,000) - 1 \\\\ &= 21.43\\% \\\\ \\% \\text{ change in sales} &= (\\$600,000 \\div \\$500,000) -1 \\\\ &= 20\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned}%change\u00a0inEBIT%change\u00a0in\u00a0sales\u200b=($425,000\u00f7$350,000)\u22121=21.43%=($600,000\u00f7$500,000)\u22121=20%\u200b\ufeff\n\nLastly, the DOL ratio is calculated as:\n\n\ufeffDOL=%change\u00a0in\u00a0operating\u00a0income%change\u00a0in\u00a0sales=21.43%20%=1.0714\\begin{aligned} DOL &= \\frac{\\% \\text{ change in operating income}}{\\% \\text{ change in sales}} \\\\ &= \\frac{21.43\\%}{ 20\\%} \\\\ &= 1.0714 \\\\ \\end{aligned}DOL\u200b=%change\u00a0in\u00a0sales%change\u00a0in\u00a0operating\u00a0income\u200b=20%21.43%\u200b=1.0714\u200b\ufeff\n\nThedegree of combined leverage (DCL)extends the degree of operating leverage to get a fuller picture of a company's ability to generate profits from sales. It multiplies DOL by degrees of financial leverage (DFL) weighted by the ratio of %change in earnings per share (EPS) over %change in sales:\n\nThis ratio summarizes the effects ofcombining financial and operating leverage, and what effect this combination, or variations of this combination, has on the corporation's earnings. Not all corporations use both operating and\u00a0financial leverage, but this formula can be used if they do. A firm with a relatively high level of combined leverage is seen as riskier than a firm with less combined leverage because high leverage means more\u00a0fixed costs\u00a0to the firm.\n\nStanley Block, Geoffrey Hirt, Bartley Danielsen. \"EBOOK: Corporate Finance Foundations - Global Edition,\" Pages 131-132.
