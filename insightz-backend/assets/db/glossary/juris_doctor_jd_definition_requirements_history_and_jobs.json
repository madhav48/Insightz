  "term": "Juris Doctor (JD): Definition, Requirements, History, and Jobs",
  "definition": "A Juris Doctor (JD) is a three-year professional degree that confers recognition that the holder has a professional degree in law. Upon completion of a JD. program and passing the bar exam, individuals are eligible to practice law in their jurisdiction. This means they can represent clients, provide legal advice, and advocate for their clients in court.\n\nA JD degree is a professional graduate degree in law. It is the standard degree required to practice law in the United States and in most other common law jurisdictions. Most JD programs typically involves three years of full-time study or its equivalency in part-time studies.\n\nSome schools offer a joint J.D.\u00a0andMBAdegree so that students can\u00a0complete both degrees in less time than it would take to complete each separately. Other combined graduate degrees include public policy, medicine, and bioengineering.\n\nLaw school applicants must already have abachelor's degree. It typically takes three years to complete the J.D. degree, after which the graduate must pass thebarexam to practice law. Each state and the District of Columbia has its own bar exam.\n\nObtaining a JD degree is different than passing the bar. Most often, students pursue the materials needed to pass the bar as part of their JD studies.\n\nThe first lawyers trained in the United States underwent an apprenticeship and\u00a0training with a lawyer who served as a mentor. The first formal law degree granted in the country was a Bachelor of Law from the College of William and Mary in 1793. Harvard University changed the name of the degree to the Latin \"Legum Baccalaureus,\" known as the LL.B., and led the 19th-century movement for a scientific study of law.The LL.B. remains the standard degree in most of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\nThe faculty of Harvard Law School first suggested changing the degree from LL.B. to J.D. in 1902\u00a0to reflect the professional nature of the degree. In 1903, the University of Chicago, which was one of only five law schools that required students to have a bachelor's degree before enrollment,\u00a0granted the\u00a0first J.D. degree.Many law schools offered both an LL.B. to students who entered without a bachelor's degree and a J.D. to students entering with a bachelor's degree.\n\nBy the early 1960s, most students entered law school with a bachelor's degree. In 1965, the American Bar Association recommended the standard law degree be the J.D., and that decree took effect by the end of the decade.\n\nIn order to get into law school, you must have an undergraduate degree, have passed the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), request your official transcripts from your undergraduate institution(s), obtain letters of recommendation, and write a personal statement.\n\nWhile many graduate programs require the completion of certain prerequisite courses, there are no such requirements for prospective law students. However, you must have earned (or be on track to earn) an undergraduate degree from an accredited institution. Your undergraduate grade point average (GPA) is a key indicator law schools consider when evaluating applicants.\n\nYou'll also need to take the LSAT. The basic\u00a0fee\u00a0for the\u00a0LSAT\u00a0during the 2024-2025 academic year\u00a0is\u00a0$238 plus $207 for Credential Assembly Service (CAS) and an additional $45 fee for each CAS report sent to the law schools you apply to. Most people end up paying $500 or more in total LSAT fees.\n\nIt is generally recommended that you spend at least three months studying for the exam, although many people dedicate up to a year studying for the exam. There are many resources online to help you study for the LSAT, including free resources. Organized prep courses that guide you through the different components of the LSAT can be quite expensive. Some individuals opt to hire a private tutor to help them prepare for the LSAT.\n\nLaw schools require official transcripts from all undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs. Each copy of your official transcript can cost between $10 and $30, so depending on how many schools you apply to, this amount can add up.The process of requesting your transcript and then getting them sent to the appropriate institution can take several days, so make sure that you give yourself adequate time.\n\nA personal statement is your opportunity to reveal your personality to the admissions committee. It's a good idea if your personal statement covers your career goals and academic achievements, although there are many different approaches. Some schools may have specific prompts they want you to address in your personal statement.\n\nMost law schools will require at least one letter of recommendation. Your letters of recommendation can be from undergraduate professors or former employers that can speak to various elements of your success.\n\nTuition varies dramatically between law schools. In 2024, top law schools will cost an estimated $80,000, while there are plenty of laws schools that charge less than $20,000.\n\nJob prospects for lawyers fell sharply following the 2008financial marketcollapse, and law school applications dropped\u00a0by 38% from 2010 to 2013. With tuition continuing to rise, some schools have looked at shortening the program.Drexel, Southwestern, and Albany Law are among the schools that offer a two-year J.D. option or allow students to start their first year of law school after completing the third year of college.\n\nJD programs typically structure their coursework to provide students with a fairly comprehensive study. During the first year, commonly referred to as the 1L year, students delve into foundational subjects such as contracts, torts, property law, criminal law, civil procedure, and constitutional law. These courses lay the groundwork for legal analysis and reasoning, both of which are leveraged as the student progresses with their degree.\n\nAs students progress into their second and third years, they often explore more specialized areas of law through. These may include corporate law, environmental law, intellectual property, family law, international law, or tax law. Students usually also get exposure to legal writing and research courses regardless of their specialization.\n\nIn addition to classes, many law schools offer clinical programs, externships, and internships where students can apply their legal knowledge in real-world settings. This gives prospective JDs an opportunity to function under the supervision of licensed attorneys.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment outlook for lawyers is promising with a projected 5% growth from 2023 to 2033. This growth rate exceeds the average for all occupations. This growth is expected to result in approximately 35,600 job openings annually during this decade.\n\nThe demand for legal services remains high, driven by the legal needs of individuals, businesses, and government entities. However, increasing price competition may lead law firms to reconsider staffing and cost-saving measures.\n\nA juris doctor graduate performs a wide range of legal tasks and responsibilities which can vary depending on their specialization and practice area. Here are some common things that a JD holder may do.\n\nA JD degree, the American law degree, is a three-year professional degree. A JD is the minimum educational level for lawyers. The JD is considered a professional doctorate.\n\nTo become a\u00a0lawyer, you'll need to earn a\u00a0Juris Doctor\u00a0(JD) degree. Once you graduate, you are entitled to take the bar exam and begin the practice of law. Obtaining a JD degree alone does not permit you to practice law. You must also pass the bar exam. Every state (and the District of Columbia) has its own bar exam.\n\nWhile the JD is the only degree necessary to become a professor of law or to obtain a license to practice law, it is not a research degree. However, there are two types of research degrees available to individuals who are interested in studying law. These are the Master of Laws\u00a0(LL.M.) degree, which typically requires a JD as a prerequisite before pursuing study, and the Doctor of Juridical Science\u00a0(SJD/JSD) degree, which typically requires a Master of Laws as a prerequisite.\n\nIt is not customary in the U.S. to address individuals who hold a JD as a \"Doctor.\" In the late 1960s, the Canons of Professional Ethics issued a full ethics opinion regarding whether lawyers could ethically use the title \"Doctor.\" The organization came down against this usage, with some exceptions. It is permissible for lawyers to use the title \"Doctor\" when dealing with countries where the use of \"Doctor\" by lawyers is standard practice. In addition, lawyers are allowed the use of the title in academia as long as the school of graduation considers the JD degree a doctorate degree.\n\nA traditional, full-time\u00a0JD program lasts three\u00a0years. There are some accelerated programs that allow individuals to complete their degrees in just two years or their undergraduate and JD degrees in a total of six years. Part-time JD programs usually take four years (or more) to finish.\n\nA Juris Doctor is a professional graduate degree in law, typically required to become a practicing attorney in the United States and some other countries. It involves a comprehensive study of legal principles, statutes, and case law, equipping graduates with the knowledge and skills needed for a legal career.\n\nHarvard Law School Library. \"Q.
