  "definition": "A non-disclosure agreement is a legal contract that protects confidential information by preventing those who sign it from disclosing the information to others.\n\nA non-disclosure agreement (NDA) is a legally binding contract that establishes a confidential relationship between two parties: one that holds sensitive information and the other that will receive that sensitive information.\n\nThe latter agrees that the information they receive won't be made available to others. An NDA is also referred to as a confidentiality agreement.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are common for businesses entering into negotiations with other businesses.\n\nThey allow the parties to share sensitive information without fear that it will end up in the hands of competitors. It may be called a mutual non-disclosure agreement in this case.\n\nThe NDA serves a purpose in avariety of situations. NDAs are generally required when two companies enter into discussions aboutdoing business togetherbut want to protect their interests and the details of any potential deal.\n\nThe language of the NDA forbids all involved from releasing information regarding any business processes or plans of the other party or parties.\n\nSome companies also require that new employees sign NDAs if they have access to sensitive information about the company.\n\nSome companies require all employees to sign an agreement while others require only certain employees, e.g., those in select departments, to sign them.\n\nNDAs may also be implemented before discussions take place between a company seeking funding and potential investors. The NDA is meant to prevent competitors from obtaining theirtrade secretsor business plans in such cases.\n\nMany investors are reluctant to sign NDAs, however. Not only will this potentially prevent them from sourcing future deals with other companies but the agreement may be very difficult to enforce in proving wrongdoing.\n\nMost investors simply won't sign the agreement so as to avoid being burdened by a legal contract even after declining an investment opportunity.\n\nThe information that's being protected may include amarketing strategyand sales plan, names of potential customers, details about a manufacturing process, or proprietary software.\n\nIf an NDA is breached, the initiating party may seek court action to prevent any further disclosures and sue the offending party for monetary damages.\n\nNDAs come in various forms, each providing for different rules and purposes.\n\nConsider a situation where two businesses are discussing the possibility of partnering. As part of strategic discussions, each company may disclose information about itsoperationsto better inform the other side of its capabilities.\n\nIn such situations, both parties often agree to share no information with others\u2014the agreement is mutual.\n\nThis type of agreement is also referred to as a unilateral NDA. It usually applies to new employees who have access to sensitive information about the company.\n\nThe employee is the only party signing the agreement and is prevented from sharing confidential information in such cases. They are the only one bound to confidentiality because they're the only party receiving sensitive information.\n\nIncreasingly, individuals are asked to sign the opposite of a non-disclosure agreement. A doctor may require a patient to sign a disclosure agreement that allows the doctor to share the patient's medical details with aninsurer.\n\nThe disclosure agreement provides the doctor with the authority to share personal information and prevents them from being sued for doing so.\n\nAn NDA is a legally binding contract. A violation can lead to legal penalties.\n\nNDAs can be customized for any situation but six major elements are generally considered essential to any non-disclosure agreement.\n\nEvery non-disclosure agreement must specifically designate each party involved. The individual receiving the sensitive information can be a specific person, all employees of another specific company, or any representative of the company.\n\nIt's very important for a company to appropriately define itself in an NDA. Consider companies with complex legal structures.\n\nThe company must determine which legal entity has ownership of the information. In many cases, a company may simply list any legal entity under a broad ownership umbrella.\n\nAn NDA must state the information that is considered to be confidential. This information is often very difficult to define appropriately.\n\nA company can't simply assume that everyone will understand what is proprietary information. It's the company's responsibility to identify the information that must not be shared.\n\nThe difficulty with defining confidential information is the process of not disclosing such information itself within the NDA. Companies may broadly assign confidentiality to a large group for this reason.\n\nFor example, a company might state that any information disclosed from or regarding itsresearch and developmentdepartment is confidential.\n\nIt may just be easier to define what's not confidential in some situations. A company might state that all information shared with an external party is to be confidential except for specific items that are determined by that company.\n\nThese types of agreements intend to allow a company to catch any exceptions that otherwise could slip by.\n\nA company may sometimes state that no information is confidential or it may simply limit how the external party may use the information that's been given to them.\n\nFor example, a company may be fine disclosing operating processes to another party but that party can't share the information with a competitor or replicate it for personal financial benefit.\n\nMany proprietary bits of information simply expire or become less valuable over time, especially those relating to research and development,\n\nConsider the early days ofApple iOS. Many components of the operating system were unknown and the technology was widely a mystery.\n\nMuch of that information has been replicated by other companies or adapted into newer technologies. What was once sensitive information may not be so any longer. Companies often define when the information is no longer confidential.\n\nVarious industries may have differing requirements and government agencies often have more stringent requirements for keeping sensitive information private.\n\nAn NDA may also detail applicable state law or laws that apply to the agreement and which party pays attorney fees in the case of a dispute.\n\nIt may also define the course of action to be taken if the agreeing party fails to comply with the terms.\n\nMany states have their own NDA requirements. You should always seek legal counsel before entering into any NDA agreement.\n\nCompanies use NDAs to protect information that includes but is not limited to:\n\nNDAs can't contain specific information that is common knowledge or already in the public domain. There can be disagreement about how this is defined.\n\nHowever, it includes information that becomes publicly known at no fault of the signer of the NDA and/or that pertains to illegal activity. Both are contrary to public policy.\n\nInformation that the signer of the NDA already knows before receiving the agreement can't be included in the agreement.\n\nInformation that could be determined via independent research or rightfully obtained from a third party can't be defined as confidential, either.\n\nMake sure that confidential information and trade secrets are distinguished from each other when you're entering into a non-disclosure agreement. The latter usually has an indefinite period of confidentiality.\n\nThe primary benefit of an NDA is that sensitive information regarding your company is kept secret. This can be anything from research and development (R&D) to possible futurepatents, finances, and negotiations.\n\nSigning an NDA is a way to keep private information from becoming public.\n\nNDA agreements are also clear. To avoid any confusion, they specify what can and can't be disclosed.\n\nNDAs can be created at a low cost as they're just a signed piece of paper. This is one of the most cost-effective ways to maintain private information.\n\nNDAs also outline the consequences of disclosing prohibited information and this should prevent any leaks.\n\nNDAs are a good way to maintain comfort and trust in a relationship as well.\n\nOne of the primary disadvantages of an NDA agreement is that it starts a relationship out on the idea of mistrust. This can set the tone of the relationship and it may not always be positive.\n\nEmployee NDAs can prevent top-tier talent from joining your firm because such prospects know they'd be limited in how they can discuss their jobs.\n\nAsking current employees to sign NDAs when they're working on special projects might sour their experience of working for the company because they feel less trusted.\n\nNDAs can also result in potential lawsuits if breached and this would become a headache for everyone involved.\n\nProvides clarity on what information can and cannot be shared\n\nCan create an atmosphere of mistrust\n\nRisk of deterring top-tier talent from joining the firm\n\nCan sour the relationship with current employees\n\nAppleis one of the most private companies in the world. It keeps its technology and future products closely guarded until it's ready to release them.\n\nThe idea is to deter competitors from stealing trade secrets and copying itsproductsbecause it's been a pioneer in technology for most of its existence. As a marketing ploy, keeping a lid on exciting and important information also generates buzz.\n\nCNBC reported in January 2021 that carmaker Hyundai confirmed in a statement that it was in talks with Apple regarding cars. This, of course, raised suspicion that Apple was possibly entering the car market or creating a product related to automobiles. Hyundai then released a follow-up statement that removed any mention of Apple.\n\nApple insists on secrecy in all its relationships and it requires that any partner sign an NDA. Apple tells its partners that they can't mention the name Apple in any manner. It has threatened partners that have leaked information with monetarily hefty lawsuits.\n\nYou'll be susceptible to the consequences outlined in the contract. It's not usually considered a crime but it can be depending on what was violated, such as if the issue is theft of trade secrets.\n\nAn individual will typically be sued if they break an NDA, which can result in a monetary fine, termination of employment, or the return of an asset. You may also be sued for intellectual property violations such as copyright infringement or breach of fiduciary duty. A court can levy financial damages and associated legal costs.\n\nEvery NDA is unique so each can last a different amount of time. Common timeframes range from one year to 10 years, however, depending on the information that's to be kept private. An NDA can also be indefinite. But to be enforceable in some states, it must not be too open-ended or generic. The courts could throw it out.\n\nThe cost of an NDA can vary depending on its complexity. It can range from free (use a template available online) to over $1,000 (if you have a lawyer create it).\n\nAn NDA template is a non-disclosure agreement format that an individual or company can follow to create their own NDA. The template will have the general legal information and blanks that can be filled in to create a unique NDA between two or more parties that applies to their relationship.\n\nNDA templates can be easily found online through an internet search. Many sites offer NDA templates for use.\n\nNon-disclosure agreements are low-cost, easy-to-create, legally binding documents between two or more parties that keep valuable information confidential.\n\nThey're used by organizations and individuals to protect their businesses or personal information and allow businesses to work together without fear of private information falling into the hands of competitors.\n\nIt's important to be as detailed as possible when you're drafting an NDA so all parties know what can and cannot be shared as well as the consequences of leaking information.\n\nNational Whistleblower Center. \"Non-Disclosure Agreements and Whistleblowers.\"\n\nCNBC. \"Hyundai Motor Says it\u2019s in Early Talks With Apple to Develop a Car, Sends Shares Soaring 19%.\"\n\nCNBC. \"Doing Business with Apple Means You Probably Can't Tell Anyone About It, As Hyundai Learned.\"\n\nWood Litigation. \"Are Non-Disclosure Agreements Enforceable in California?\"\n\nLegalZoom. \"What Is an NDA?
