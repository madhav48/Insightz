  "term": "Short Run: Definition in Economics, Examples, and How It Works",
  "definition": "The short run is at least one fixed input in the future while others are variable for business, or an economy behaving differently depending on how long it has to react to certain stimuli.\n\nThe short run has two definitions as an economic concept:\n\nThe short run does not refer to a specific duration of time, but rather\u00a0is unique to the firm, industry, or economic variable being studied.\n\nThe short run as a constraint differs from the long run. In the short run, leases, contracts, and wage agreements limit a firm\u2019s ability to adjust production or wages to maintain a rate ofprofit. In the long run, there are no fixed costs; costs find balance when the combination of outputs that a firm puts forth results in the sought-after amount of goods at the cheapest possible price.\n\nFor example, if a hospital experiences lower-than-expected demand in a given year, but its entire employment force of doctors, nurses, and technicians is under contract for the year, then the hospital has no choice but to swallow a cut in its profit. In the long run, firms in capital-intensive industries, such as oil and mining, have time to expand or shrink operations in factories or investments in correspondence with changingdemand. But in the short run, they are unable to capitalize on changes in demand with the same degree of flexibility.\n\nThe short run does not refer to a specific period of time and is instead specific to the firm, industry, or economic factor being studied.\n\nThe primary objective of the short run is to determine the level of production that maximizes profit or minimizes losses given the current constraints. One related concept ismarginal analysis. Firms evaluate the marginal product of each variable input, which is the additional output generated by employing one more unit of that input. Initially, as more variable inputs are added, the marginal product tends to increase due to better utilization of fixed inputs. However, due to thelaw of diminishing marginal returns, the marginal product eventually decreases as more units of the variable input are added. Firms aim to balance the input levels where the cost of an additional input equals the revenue generated from the additional output it produces.\n\nCost considerations also play a role in short-run production decisions. Firms categorize costs into fixed costs, which remain constant regardless of output level, and variable costs, which change with the level of production. By analyzing average and marginal costs, firms can determine the most cost-effective production level. The marginal cost, which is the additional cost of producing one more unit of output, is particularly important.\n\nIn the short run, external factors such as market demand and input prices also influence production decisions. Firms must respond to changes in demand by adjusting their output levels to maintain profitability. For instance, an increase in demand may prompt a firm to temporarily increase production by hiring more labor or utilizing existing resources more intensively. This could happen around theholiday season, for example. Input prices can also impact production decisions. Rising input costs may force firms to find more efficient production methods or pass the increased costs onto consumers through higher prices.\n\nFirms seek to produce at the output level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, as this maximizes profit.\n\nThe short run in economics has several limitations, primarily due to the presence of fixed inputs and the constraints they impose on production flexibility. Here\u2019s a short list of those downsides:\n\nIn the short run, at least one input (such as capital or land) is fixed, meaning it can\u2019t be adjusted to meet changes in production needs. This rigidity limits a firm\u2019s ability to respond swiftly to fluctuations in market demand or changes in input prices. That fixed variable may be unfavorable, and the company may want to change it, but sometimes it simply can\u2019t because of market forces, contract obligations, or financial constraints.\n\nThe law ofdiminishing marginal returnsposes a significant limitation in the short run. As more units of a variable input are added to a fixed input, the additional output produced by each new unit eventually decreases. This diminishing productivity can lead to higher marginal costs and lower profitability as firms attempt to increase output. Eventually, a company may get to a point where its marginal expense costs more than its marginal revenue, meaning it\u2019s no longer profitable to make the good (at least in the short run).\n\nThe presence of fixed costs, such as rent, salaries, and equipment depreciation, in the short run means that these costs do not vary with the level of output. This rigidity can lead to financial strain if a firm experiences a sudden drop in demand or needs to scale down production. Fixed costs must be covered regardless of production levels, which can result in lower profit margins or even losses during periods of low output. This means in the short run, companies may experience a higher level of risk in regard to needing to make sure it has sufficientcash flowto meet ongoing operational needs.\n\nThe short run often forces firms to focus on immediate operational concerns rather than long-term strategic planning. Decisions are made to address short-term constraints and immediate profit maximization, potentially at the expense of long-term growth and innovation. This short-term focus can lead to underinvestment in research and development, employee training, and capital improvements. For example, if a company is perpetually having to toss employees into \u201cemergency coverage situations,\u201d that company may not be building the skill set within those employees related to its long-run target.\n\nThe short run is characterized by at least one fixed input while other inputs are variable. Meanwhile, the long run is a period in which all inputs can be varied. Firms have the flexibility to adjust all factors of production, including capital, labor, and technology. This means that firms can expand or contract their production or offerings in more flexible ways.\n\nThe long run is associated with the concept of returns to scale, which examines how changes in the scale of production affect output. In the long run, firms can achieveeconomies of scale, where increasing the scale of production leads to lower average costs, ordiseconomies of scale, where increasing the scale results in higher average costs. In the short run (like we\u2019ll see at the end example with Delta Air Lines), the company is more interested in weathering short-term opportunities.\n\nThe distinction between the short run and the long run also affects market dynamics. In the short term, companies may experience periods of higher or lower profitability depending on short-run strategies. This can fluctuate from period to period based on the market. In the long run, however, a company\u2019s profitability is perhaps less of a reflection on the industry and more on the firm\u2019s ability to adapt and change. For instance, the Apple (AAPL) strategy to manufacture Apple Vision Pro is a long-run strategy that was implemented based on its interest in adapting to market conditions; the specificpricing strategyit may implement for its virtual-reality headset is a short-run strategy.\n\nA real-world example of short-run decisions is the airline industry with a company like Delta (DAL). The airline industry has significant fixed costs, such as aircraft leases, maintenance, and airport gate rentals, which can\u2019t be easily adjusted in the short run. However, Delta can make several variable adjustments to respond to market conditions. It can:\n\nThe short run in economics refers to a period during which at least one input in the production process is fixed and can\u2019t be changed. Typically, capital is considered the fixed input, while other inputs like labor and raw materials can be varied. This time frame is sufficient for firms to make some adjustments, but not enough to alter all factors of production.\n\nFixed costs in the short run do not change with the level of output because they are associated with inputs that can\u2019t be adjusted immediately. Examples include rent, salaries of permanent staff, and depreciation of capital equipment. These costs remain constant irrespective of production levels, leading to the classification as fixed.\n\nShort-run profit maximization is achieved by producing at the output level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue. Firms analyze the additional cost of producing one more unit (marginal cost) and compare it to the additional revenue generated (marginal revenue) to determine the most profitable production level.\n\nChanges in demand affect firms in the short run by altering the equilibrium price and quantity in the market. Firms may respond by adjusting their variable inputs to match the new level of demand, but they are constrained by fixed inputs, which can limit their ability to scale production fully.\n\nShort-run supply curves show the relationship between the price level and the quantity of goods that firms are willing to produce and sell, given fixed inputs. These curves typically slope upward, indicating that higher prices incentivize firms to increase production by adjusting variable inputs.\n\nIn economics, the short run denotes a period where at least one input is fixed, limiting a firm\u2019s ability to adjust its production capacity fully. During this phase, firms focus on optimizing variable inputs such as labor and materials to maximize output and profitability within the constraints of fixed costs.",
