  "term": "Forecasting: What It Is, How It\u2019s Used in Business and Investing",
  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nForecasting is a planning tool by which historical data is used to predict the direction of future trends.\n\nForecasting is a technique that uses historical data to make informed decisions about future events or conditions. It isn't simply guessing. A tool for businesses and investors alike, forecasting takes expert analysis and applies complex models to allocate portfolios and budgets.\n\nBut just how reliable are these crystal ball-like predictions? After all, economists, investors, and financial planners frequently display a striking talent for mordant humor about the art of economic prediction. \"The only function of economic forecasting,\" the famed 20th-century economist John Kenneth Galbraith said, \"is to make astrology look respectable.\"Or, as an equally influential economist, Paul A. Samuelson, put it, Wall Street models \"predicted nine of the last five recessions.\"\n\nYet, forecasting is central to modern investing and business practices. Businesses hire and expand based on predicting sales figures, market demand, or economic indicators. Investors trade stocks, invest in funds, or rashly exit the market based on predictions about stock prices, interest rates, or broader market moves. However, the work of forecasting applies far beyond boardrooms and trading floors. Consumer spending patterns, job market trends, and even geopolitical events all fall under the purview of forecasters.\n\nKeep in mind economistJohn Maynard Keynes'sdictum that \u201cthe inevitable never happens. It is the unexpected always.\" We detail below the different forecasting methods and how they share a common goal: To reduce uncertainty and provide a basis for the planning we can do today. We also provide 12 principles you can apply when forecasting to get better results.\n\nToday, forecasting blends data analysis, machine learning, statistical modeling, and expert judgment. Forecasting providesbenchmarksfor firms, which need a long-term perspective of operations. For example, much of the derivatives market in options and futures trading is an outgrowth of business and investor forecasting, all to hedge or insure businesses against adverse market changes that could hurt their firms.\n\nEquity analystsuse forecasting to predict how trends, such as gross domestic product (GDP) or unemployment, will change in the coming quarter or year. Statisticians employ forecasting to analyze the potential impact of a change in business operations. Analysts then derive earnings estimates that are often aggregated into a consensus number. If actual earnings announcements miss the estimates, it can have a large impact on a company\u2019s stock price.\n\nIn business management,forecastingserves as a cornerstone of strategic decisions, influencing almost every aspect of an organization's operations. By attempting to predict trends and conditions through qualitative and quantitative measures discussed below, companies aim to position themselves advantageously in the marketplace.\n\nThese predictions guide critical choices ranging from market entry strategies and product development to supply chain management and workforce planning, and so the task is often to move from forecasts to planning.\n\nThe consequences of getting a forecast wrong can be far-reaching. Correct predictions allow businesses to improve how they divide their resources, whether they can capitalize on emerging prospects, and mitigate risks. Conversely, inaccurate forecasts can lead to misaligned strategies, inefficient use of resources, missed opportunities, and risks that weren't managed or insured for. Here are the ripple effects of forecasting on various business functions:\n\nThe consequences of poor forecasting are often severe.Companies may find themselves overextended in declining markets, struggling with excess inventory, or unable to meet unexpected surges in demand.\n\nThis is a good point to pause and review, with this table below, the differences between the two:\n\nWe can now explore the main methods used in forecasting, each with specific strengths and times when they're best applied:\n\nQuantitative forecasting techniques rely on numerical data and statistical models to predict future outcomes. These methods are particularly useful for short- to medium-term forecasts where historical data is available and patterns can be discerned.\n\nThe further out the forecast, the greater the likelihood that the forecast will be wrong.\n\nThis method analyzes historical data points, such as sales figures or stock prices, to identify patterns or trends over time. These statistical relationships are then extrapolated into the future to generate forecasts with confidence intervals to understand the likelihood of specific outcomes. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed.\n\nTechniques likemoving averagesand exponential smoothing help level out fluctuations to highlight underlying trends, making it easier to predict future values. This is at the heart of technical analysis in investing.In addition, time series forecasts often involve trend and cyclical fluctuation analysis.\n\nRegressionmodels assess the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.For example, a company might use regression analysis to understand how their spending on marketing or economic conditions affects their sales. By establishing these relationships, businesses can know how to plan when marketing budgets are needed or as economic conditions change.\n\nEconometricsis a specialized field that bridges economics, mathematics, and statistics. It focuses on using statistical methods to analyze economic data and test economic theories.Econometriciansdevelop models that quantify relationships between economic variables, such as how changes in interest rates affect investment or how government spending impacts economic growth.\n\nAnalysts use these models to predict GDP growth, inflation rates, and unemployment levels. Econometric models are particularly valuable for long-term planning and policymaking.\n\nQuantitative models tend to share these aspects:\n\nQualitative forecasting methods rely on expert opinions and market insights rather than purely numerical data. Researchers also call this area \"judgmental forecasting.\"Examples of qualitative forecasting models include interviews, on-site visits, market research, polls, and surveys that apply theDelphi method(which relies on aggregated expert opinions).\n\nGathering data for qualitative analysis can sometimes be difficult or time-consuming. The CEOs of large companies aren't going to take a phone call from aretail investoror show them around a facility. However, you can still sift through news reports and the text included in companies\u2019 filings to get a sense of managers\u2019 records, strategies, and philosophies. These techniques are especially valuable in situations where historical data is limited or in a period where previous data is unreliable since the market is changing.\n\nThis structured technique involves a panel of experts who provide their forecasts and assumptions anonymously. Their responses are aggregated and shared with the group, followed by rounds of discussion and revision until a consensus is reached. The Delphi method is often used in all kinds of studies where expertise is needed but it's especially worthwhile for long-term strategic planning and for forecasting in uncertain or rapidly changing environments.\n\nSurveys, focus groups, and interviews are common tools used to gather qualitative data from customers, industry experts, and other stakeholders. This information can reveal emerging trends, shifts in consumer preferences, and other factors that might not yet be seen in numerical data.\n\nThis technique involves developing multiple, plausible scenarios based on different assumptions about future conditions.Businesses can then assess how each scenario might impact their operations and plan accordingly. This is a crucial tool inrisk management.\n\nResearchers have long been interested in which kind of methods work best and in which circumstances. Of course, different parts of finance and other disciplines tend to side toward quantitative or qualitative methods (e.g.,quantsare unlikely to yield studies on the gains of market research or other judgmental methods).\n\nBut researchers have often found that determining which method to use depends on a variety of factors. For instance, a company might use time series analysis to identify historical trends and supplement this with insights from market research to account for recent changes in consumer behavior.\n\nGiven this, it's no surprise that researchers have demonstrated empirically that combined or hybrid approaches often do best by pulling in the best of both worlds for more informed predictions.Neither human judgment nor quantitative methods are universally superior.Instead, their strengths are often complementary.\n\nFlawed forecasts are commonly a central part of the story when businesses fail.\n\nQuantitative methods do best in processing large data sets and identifying patterns in them, especially when augmented with AI andmachine learning, while human judgment is best in interpreting ambiguous situations and incorporating contextual knowledge that may not be captured by data alone.Reviewing recent work in this area, we culled these key points about combining qualitative and quantitative approaches:\n\nThe correct forecasting method depends on the type and scope of the forecast. Qualitative methods are more time-consuming and costly but can make very accurate forecasts given a limited scope. For instance, they might be used to predict how well a company\u2019s new product launch might be received by the public.\n\nFor quicker analyses that can encompass a larger scope, quantitative methods are often more useful. Looking at big data sets, statistical software packages today can crunch the numbers in a matter of minutes or seconds. However, the larger the data set and the more complex the analysis, the pricier it can be.\n\nThus, forecasters often perform a quick cost-benefit analysis\u2014a mini-forecast\u2014to determine which method will increase their chances of accurate predictions for the least cost in time and money.\n\nWhile often mentioned in the same breath, budgeting and forecasting serve separate yet complementary roles in financial planning, investing, and business management. Budgeting is primarily a planning tool, so it has some of the elements seen above when we covered planning as opposed to forecasting.\n\nBudgeting is a detailed estimate of future income and expenses so you have a road-map for allocating resources and setting performance targets. Budgets are often more static documents, representing management's commitments and expectations for the period.Here are the main characteristics of budgeting:\n\nMeanwhile, forecasting is about predicting financial outcomes based on present and historical data.\u00a0So, when you forecast, you aren't setting targets. Instead, you anticipate what will happen in the future and why you do it, helping organizations and investors adjust strategies and respond to changing conditions. Here are the main characteristics of forecasting:\n\nPurpose and focus: Budgeting sets financial targets and allocates resources\n\nTime horizon: Typically covers a fixed period (usually one year)\n\nSpecificity: Highly detailed with specific line items\n\nApplication: Used for setting goals, controlling costs, and measuring performance\n\nFrequency of review and adjustment: Reviewed and adjusted annually\u2014relatively static\n\nPurpose and focus: Forecasting predicts future financial outcomes and trends\n\nTime horizon: Can be short-term (monthly/quarterly) or long-term\n\nSpecificity: Less detailed, focusing on broader financial trends\n\nApplication: Used for strategic planning and decisions\n\nFrequency of review and adjustment: Reviewed and adjusted regularly (monthly/quarterly)\n\nEffective forecasting is a critical skill in business and finance, providing a basis for the decisions that can make or break a business or portfolio. While no forecast is perfect, companies and investors with dependable forecasts are better equipped to navigate uncertainties, seize prospects, and maintain a competitive edge. The following principles, drawn from expert insights and those with practical experience, form the core of effective forecasting:\n\nIn addition to these rules, you'll want to practice the number one principle for what to do after you put a forecast into action through planning and budgets: Regularly reassess the forecast accuracy using appropriate measures and adjust your models as needed to improve performance over time.\n\nA major constraint on forecasting is that it involves the future, which is fundamentally unknowable. As a result, forecasts can only be educated conjectures. While there are several methods of improving the reliability of forecasts, the assumptions or data that go into the models have to be correct. Otherwise, the result will be \"garbage in, garbage out.\" Even if the data is good, forecasting often relies on historical data, which is not guaranteed to be valid in the future, as things can and do change over time. It's also impossible to correctly factor in unusual or one-off events, like a crisis or disaster.\n\nPerfectly predicting the market's ups and downs is impossible. However, investors can use forecasts to analyze company valuations, identify growth sectors, and manage risk within their portfolios. That said, unforeseeable events always impact the market, so forecasts should be just one piece of the investment puzzle.\n\nThe2007-08 financial crisisstands out as a major event that seemed, to most, to occur out of nowhere. More recently, one of the most notable economic predictions that went wrong was the underestimated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. In early 2020, many experts and financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and various central banks, initially predicted a relatively swift economic recovery following short-term disruptions. However, the prolonged nature of the pandemic, with multiple waves of infection and varying responses by different countries, led to far more severe and long-lasting economic consequences than anticipated. Then the IMF failed to predict the surge in inflation that arrived afterward.\n\nForecasts help managers, analysts, and investors make informed decisions about the future. Without good forecasts, many of us would be in the dark and would resort to guesses or speculation. By using qualitative and quantitative data analysis, forecasters can better understand what lies ahead.\n\nBusinesses use forecasts and projections to inform managerial decisions and capital allocations. Analysts use forecasts toestimate corporate earningsfor subsequent periods. Economists may make more macro-level forecasts as well, such as predicting GDP growth or changes to employment. However, since we cannot definitively know the future, and since forecasts often rely on historical data, their accuracy will always come with some room for error\u2014and, in some cases, may end up being way off.\n\nSusan Ratcliffe. \"Oxford Essential Quotations.\" (Online Version)\n\nSamuelson, Paul J. \"Science and Stocks: Sense and Nonsense.\"Newsweek, p. 92.\n\nDevon Powers. \"On Trend : The Business of Forecasting the Future,\" Pages 3-10.
