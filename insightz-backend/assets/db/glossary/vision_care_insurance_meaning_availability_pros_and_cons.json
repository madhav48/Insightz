  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nVision careinsurancewill often cover routine eye health expenses such as eye exams, contact lens fittings, contact lenses, and eyeglass lenses and frames. Some plans may even provide a discount on LASIK procedures and other corrective surgeries.\n\nA vision care plan may cover the cost of these items in total, up to a preset limit, or it may require the policyholder to pay a flat fee or percentage fee to share the expense with the insurer.\n\nVision care insurance tends to be inexpensive compared to other types of insurance because many of the covered costs are predictable and expensive claims are rare. It resembles a discount plan more closely than an actual insurance plan because insurance protects against unforeseen and potentially catastrophic expenses.\n\nIt's essential\u00a0you\u00a0fully understand each plan's costs and the benefits they come with when you buy vision care insurance. Take a look at the price for one year ofvision insurancecompared with the cost of an eye exam.\u00a0Although vision care insurance is inexpensive, it may not be a good deal for the consumer if the premiums and co-payments under the plan are higher than paying for vision care expenses out of pocket.\n\nThe cost of vision care insurance depends on your plan but you may pay as little as $5 a month for a basic plan from your employer or buying a plan directly from a provider. For example, VSP Vision insurance offers a $13 a month premium.\n\nEye diseases, which are unpredictable and expensive to treat, will generally be covered by health insurance, not vision care insurance.\u00a0Vision care coverage through manyemployer-sponsored health plansgenerally works a little differently than other health insurance or major medical insurance plans.\n\nBecause eye exams can detect hidden medical problems, even those with perfect vision should get one from time to time. As someone\u00a0ages, they'll need more frequent vision exams, according\u00a0to the Mayo Clinic.People with poor vision, a family history of eye disease, or a condition that increases the\u00a0risk of eye disease like diabetes should have more frequent exams.If routine exams are all that will be needed, then the cost of insurance probably isn't\u00a0worth it.\n\nBefore purchasing eye care insurance, think about what you need in regard to your health, and what offerings that insurance provides that you will use, such as discounted lenses.\n\nVision care insurance can often be obtained through your employer, association union, or government programs like\u00a0Medicare or Medicaid. Most vision insurance providers also offer policies that you canpurchase individually.\n\nVision insurance is often a value-added benefit linked to indemnity health insurance, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), andpreferred provider organizations (PPOs)contracted with managed vision care networks to provide eye care services.\n\nThere are benefits and limitations to vision insurance, and whether you should get it or not may depend on how badly you need it. If you have a history of eye-related medical needs, it may be worth the extra money to purchase vision insurance. If you only go to the eye doctor once a year for routine check-ups, it might not be necessary for you to buy an expensive eye care insurance plan.\n\nOverall, vision care insurance isn't expensive, and it may save you money over time, especially if you have recurring eye care troubles or regularly purchase corrective lenses. If you end up needing eye surgery, it can help with the cost as well.\n\nCons of vision insurance are that it may not necessarily cover the type of service you need or will not allow you to travel out of its network for treatment. In addition, if there is a specific brand of lenses you like using, or specialized lenses or frames, it may offer a limited line of brands.\n\nThese can often be easily added onto insurance plans.\n\nYou can also buy a plan individually.\n\nThe plans offset the cost of corrective lenses.\n\nYou may not be able to use out-of-network services.\n\nIf you don't need regular eye care, it may not be worth the money.\n\nSome vision care insurance limits what you can purchase in terms of eye wear.\n\nVision insurance is usually sold as an add-on to health insurance from your employer or you can purchase it separately.\n\nWalmart's vision center takes its own Walmart Vision Plan and it is an out-of-network provider for many vision plans, including Cole Managed Vision, EyeMed, and Davis Vision, In order to find out if Walmart Vision Center takes your insurance, you must visit its website because it varies by state and location.\n\nDavis Vision insurance offers a wide range of both in-network and out-of-network providers including Walmart, Visionworks. Costco, For Eyes, and Sam's Club.\n\nThe VSP website claims to have thousands of in-network optometrists and ophthalmologists located all over the United States, including vision care centers in Costco stores.\n\nCostco's website states it \"now accepts most vision insurance plans\" for its vision care services.\n\nVision careinsurancemay be helpful to cover routine eye care such as exams, fittings and help pay for corrective lenses. Some plans offer more benefits than others, but if you don't have a reason to see an eye doctor more than a regular check-up, it might not be worth buying a plan, even if it is affordable.\n\nVSP Vision Care. \"Plan Options.\"\n\nMayo Clinic. \"Healthy Aging: Aging: What to Expect.\"\n\nCleveland Clinic. \"Common Age-Related Eye Problems.\"\n\nWalmart. \"Vision Insurance Reimbursement.\"\n\nDavis Vision. \"Davis Vision Plan,\" Page 1.\n\nVSP Vision Care. \"Find an Eye Doctor.\"",
