  "definition": "A listing agreement is a contract under which a property owner (as principal) authorizes a real estate broker (as agent) to find a buyer for the property on the owner's terms. In exchange for this service, the ownerpays a commission.\n\nLess commonly, the term listing agreement also refers to a contract made between a security issuer (e.g., apublic company) and the financialexchangethat hosts the issue. Examples of exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), and the London Stock Exchange (LSE).\n\nA listing agreement authorizes the broker to represent thesellerand their property to third parties. The listing agreement is an employment contract rather than a real estate contract: The broker is hired to represent the seller, but no property is transferred between the two.\n\nUnder the provisions of real estate license laws,only a broker can act as an agent to list, sell, or rentanother person's real estate. In most states, listing agreements must be written.\n\nBecause the same considerations arise in almost all real estate transactions, most listing agreements require similar information, starting with a description of the property. The description typically includes a list of personal property that will be left with the property when it's sold, as well as a list of personal property the seller expects to remove (for example, appliances, and window treatments).\n\nThe listing agreement also specifies the listing price, broker's duties, seller's duties, broker's compensation, terms for mediation, an automatic termination date, and any additional terms and conditions.\n\nThough listing agreements are legally binding, it's possible to terminate the contract in certain situations\u2014for example, if the broker does nothing to market the property. In addition, the listing agreement will be terminated if the property is destroyed (e.g., by a fire or natural disaster), or upon the death, bankruptcy, or insanity of either the broker or seller.\n\nWith an open listing, a seller retains the right to employ any number of brokers as agents. It\u2019s a nonexclusive type of listing, and the seller is obligated to pay a commission only to the broker who successfully finds a ready, willing, and able buyer. The seller retains the right to sell the property independently without any obligation to pay a commission.\n\nTheMultiple Listing Service(MLS) is a shared database established by cooperating\u00a0real estate\u00a0brokers to provide data about properties for sale.\u00a0MLS allows brokers to see one another's listings of properties for sale with the goal of connecting homebuyers to sellers. Under this arrangement, both the listing and selling\u00a0broker\u00a0benefit by consolidating and sharing information and by sharing commissions.\n\nWith anexclusive agency listing, one broker is authorized to act as the exclusive agent for the seller. The seller retains the right to sell the property without obligation to the broker. However, the seller is obligated to pay a commission to the broker if the broker is the procuring cause of the sale.\n\nAn exclusive right-to-sell listing is the most commonly used contract. With this type of listing agreement, one broker is appointed the sole seller's agent and has exclusive authorization to represent the property. The broker receives a commission no matter who sells the property while the listing agreement is in effect.\n\nWhiterock Locators. \"Can you terminate a real estate listing agreement?
