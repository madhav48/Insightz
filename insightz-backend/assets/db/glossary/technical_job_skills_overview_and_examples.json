  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nTechnical job skills, sometimes referred to ashard skills, are specific talents and expertise an individual possesses that help them perform a certain task or job. These skills differ fromsoft skills, which instead describe character and personality traits.\n\nTechnical skills are abilities an individual acquires through practice and learning, although a person may bring an inherent propensity for a certain skill. An individual who possesses a particular proficiency for coding, for instance, would have a sought-after technical skill as a job candidate at a software or technology company.\n\nTechnical job skills are ideal to list on the skill section of a resume because they shine a light on abilities and strengths. However, it is important to realize not all technical skills at an individual\u2019s disposal should be listed. The list should be tailored to fit the job. This gives the individual a greater chance of getting hired.\n\nNew or prospective employees may be subject to anaptitude testto measure their proficiency at various technical skills and abilities. Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics. Note that an aptitude test does not test knowledge or intelligence; only a particular skill or propensity. Therefore, it is not a test for which a person can study.\n\nEmployees with technical job skills are referred to asskilled labor, and may be contrasted withunskilled labor.\n\nOn job applications, cover letters, resumes, and in-person during the interview process, employers seek out applicants with both hard and soft skills. Hard, or technical, skills are those abilities or skill sets that are teachable and can be quantified easily. Examples of hard skills include certificates or degrees in specific disciplines; mastery or fluidity in a foreign language; efficient operation of specific machinery; and the ability to generate computer programs.\n\nSoft skills differ from hard skills in that they are subjective and can be incredibly difficult to quantify. Soft skills are inherent skills relating to an individual\u2019s character or personality. These skills are sometimes referred to as \u201cinterpersonal skills\u201d or \u201cpeople skills.\u201d Examples of soft skills include effective communication; working well with others; time management; the ability to be persuasive; flexibility; and patience.\n\nTechnical job skills play a vital role in getting hired. Certain hard skills are necessary for a variety of jobs, and some positions require a specific set or combination of these skills. However, some of the more basic or intermediate types of technical skills are fairly easy for an employer to teach to a new employee. Soft skills, because they are essentially inherent, are extremely difficult to teach. In some cases, soft skills cannot be taught.\n\nFor this reason, employers constantly look for potential employees with a mix of technical and soft skills that will allow them to complete tasks in a fast and efficient way. Because customer service/satisfaction is one of the most important aspects for any company or organization, soft skills are often considered of greater value.\n\nIn some careers, a professionalcertificationcan demonstrate mastery of certain technical skills.\n\nAccounting is a profession that requires a fairly rigid set of technical skills. In addition to knowing the ins and outs of accounting practice and tax law, familiarity with industry-specific software, such as Great Plains, QuickBooks, Peachtree, SAP Software, and tax preparation software, is also often required these days.\n\nAccountantsneed to know how to prepare and interpretfinancial statementsand other accounting reports, develop efficient financial reporting mechanisms, and plan and implement accounting controls.\n\nNote that some of the other skills accountants need might be categorized as soft skills. They must be prepared to communicate effectively with regulators, deal with externalauditors, and stay updated on current issues and changes in industry regulations.\n\nAccording to employment site Indeed, Generative AI is the most valuable technical skill in 2024, providing a 47% salary boost over similar candidates without that skill. Other highly sought-after technical skills include machine learning systems, programming languages, and computer chip design.\n\nAccording to job site Indeed, skills like web design and marketing are relatively easy to learn but can provide an easy income boost. These include web design and editing, graphic design, computer programming, and digital marketing. These are skills that you can learn on your own, and do not require any special certification.\n\nYour resume should include a separate skills section that includes a mix of soft and hard skills. These can include programming languages, software proficiency, and other technical knowledge that prospective employers may be looking for.\n\nTechnical job skills are the specific abilities and expertise to perform certain jobs. This can include experience with mechanical equipment, proficiency with specialized software, or knowledge of certain business procedures. In some cases, a professional certification can demonstrate one's technical skills.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Information Security Analysts: Job Outlook.\"\n\nIndeed. \"Highest Paid Skills in Tech.\"\n\nIndeed. \"18 Tech Jobs that Require Little Education to Get Started.'",
