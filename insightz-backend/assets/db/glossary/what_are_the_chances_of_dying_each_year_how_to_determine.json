  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe yearly probability of dying attempts to identify how likely it is that an individual will pass within the next 12 months but the timespans can be adjusted.\n\nEstimates of the yearly probability of dying are based onmortality tables, also known as actuarial or life tables. They reflect the percentage of people in a particular group who are statistically likely to die in a defined period. These percentages are derived by dividing the number of deaths in that group by the number of people who were alive at the beginning of the period.\n\nThe mortality tables used by the U.S.Social Security Administrationestimate that a 30-year-old male has a 0.23% chance of dying within one year. The odds rise to 1.2% for a 60-year-old while a 119-year-old, which is as high as the table goes, has a 100% chance of mortality within a year.\n\nMortality tables and yearly probability of dying calculations can add other variables as well, with smoking vs. nonsmoking being a major one forlife insuranceandannuity contractpurposes. They are also calculated using other variables such as education, income, and the specific cause of death, depending on what the researchers are studying.\n\nOne widely used set of mortality tables, particularly in the insurance industry, is theCommissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) mortality tables, adopted by theNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. The CSO tables differentiate mortality risk by age, sex, and tobacco use.\n\nThe probability of dying is frequently calculated using longer or shorter time frames than one year. For example, a common measure of child health in a given country is the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR), which estimates the probability of a child dying between birth and age five.Maternal mortality rates are based on a period equal to the length of time the woman is pregnant or within 42 days of the end of pregnancy, based on the World Health Organization\u2019s definition.\n\nTheyearly probability of livingis the flip side of the yearly probability of dying. Also based on mortality tables, it is an estimate of the likelihood of an individual still being alive a year into the future, based on their age, sex, and sometimes other factors. Like the yearly probability of dying, it is widely used in the insurance industry.\n\nWhile a person\u2019s yearly probability of dying rises as they age, their yearly probability of living goes in the opposite direction.\n\nThe mortality rate represents the number of deaths as apercentage of a total populationin a given period, often one year. The most basic mortality rate, referred to as the crude mortality rate among statisticians, doesn\u2019t differentiate between men and women or according to other factors. More specialized types of mortality rates include age-specific mortality rates, sex-specific mortality rates, race-specific mortality rates, and cause-specific mortality rates, among others.\n\nLife expectancyis another use of mortality data, an estimate of how many more years a person with certain characteristics (current age, sex, and so forth) is likely to live or what age they are likely to attain before they die. Life expectancy estimates have many uses in the insurance industry and elsewhere.\n\nFor example, theInternal Revenue Servicepublishes life expectancy tables that taxpayers must use to determine their annualrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)from their retirement accounts. In its most recent tables, for example, a newborn has a life expectancy of another 84.6 years, while someone who is 120 or older (the top limit of the table) has a life expectancy of one more year.\n\nThe yearly probability of dying is a statistical estimate of the likelihood of a person dying within one year. It can cover an entire population or break down death rates according to age, sex, and other factors, such as tobacco use.\n\nThe yearly probability of dying is widely used in health studies, by the government, and by the insurance industry. Other mortality-related statistics can use periods shorter or longer than a single year.\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cActuarial Life Table.\u201d\n\nSociety of Actuaries. \u201c2017 Commissioners Standard Ordinary (CSO) Tables.\u201d\n\nWorld Health Organization. \u201cUnder-Five Mortality Rate (Deaths Per 1,000 Live Births) (Health Inequality Monitor).\u201d\n\nWorld Health Organization. \u201cMaternal Deaths.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 590-B (2022), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs),\u201d search \u201cAppendix B.\u201d",
