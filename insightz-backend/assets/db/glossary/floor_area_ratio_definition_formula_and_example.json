  "term": "Floor Area Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Example",
  "definition": "The floor area ratio is the relationship between the total amount of usable floor area that a building has or has been permitted to have and the total area of the lot on which the building stands. A higher ratio would likely indicate a dense or urban construction. Local governments use the floor area ratio forzoningcodes.\n\nYou can determine the ratio by dividing the total or gross floor area of the building by the gross area of the lot.\n\nFloor\u00a0Area\u00a0Ratio=Total\u00a0Building\u00a0Floor\u00a0AreaGross\u00a0Lot\u00a0Area\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Floor Area Ratio} = \\frac{ \\text{Total Building Floor Area} }{ \\text{Gross Lot Area} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bFloor\u00a0Area\u00a0Ratio=Gross\u00a0Lot\u00a0AreaTotal\u00a0Building\u00a0Floor\u00a0Area\u200b\u200b\n\nThe floor area ratio accounts for the entire floor area of a building, not simply the building's footprint. Unoccupied areas such as basements, parking garages, stairs, and elevator shafts are excluded from the square footage calculation.\n\nBuildings with a different number of stories can have the same floor-area-ratio value. Every city has a limited capacity or limited space that can be utilized safely. Any use beyond this point puts undue stress on a city. This is sometimes known as the safe load factor.\n\nThe floor area ratio is variable becausepopulationdynamics, growth patterns, and construction activities vary and because the nature of the land or space where a building is placed can vary. Industrial, residential, commercial, agricultural, and nonagricultural spaces have differing safe load factors so they typically have differing floor area ratios as well.\n\nLocal governments establish regulations and restrictions that determine the floor area ratio.\n\nThe floor area ratio is a key determining factor for development in any country. A low floor area ratio is generally a deterrent to construction. Many industries and specifically thereal estateindustry seek hikes in the floor area ratio to open up space and land resources to developers.\n\nAn increased floor area ratio allows a developer to complete more building projects and this inevitably leads to greater sales, decreased expenditures per project, and greatersupply to meet demand.\n\nThe floor area ratio of a 1,000-square-foot building with one story situated on a 4,000-square-foot lot would be 0.25x. A two-story building on the same lot where each floor was 500 square feet would have the same floor-area-ratio\u00a0value.\n\nA lot has a\u00a0floor area ratio\u00a0of 2.0x and the square footage is 1,000. A developer could construct a building that covers as much as 2,000 square feet in this scenario. It could include a 1,000-square-foot building with two stories.\n\nConsider an apartment building for sale in Charlotte, North Carolina. The asking price for the apartment complex is $3 million and it spans 17,350 square feet. The entire lot is 1.81 acres or 78,843 square feet. The floor area ratio is 0.22x, or 17,350 divided by 78,843.\n\nThe term bulk relates to the size and shape of buildings located on a lot as well as associated features of the lot that aren't necessarily part of one or more buildings. Bulk regulations include rules such as how closely these can be situated to lot lines as well as the floor area ratio.\n\nThe floor area ratio calculates the size of the building relative to the lot but lot coverage takes the size of all buildings and structures into account. The lot coverage ratio includes structures such as garages, swimming pools, and sheds, including nonconforming buildings.\n\nThe law of supply and demand explains a delicate economic balance. Supply is how much of a given product that manufacturers have produced and want to sell. Demand measures how badly consumers want that product and how much of it they're willing to buy. These two factors are ideally equal but that doesn't always occur.\n\nThe impact that the floor area ratio has on land value cuts both ways. An increased floor area ratio\u00a0may make aproperty more valuableif an apartment complex can be built that allows for more spacious rentals or more tenants. But a developer who can build a larger apartment complex on one piece of land may decrease the value of an adjoining property with a high sale value bolstered by a view that has become obstructed.\n\nCFI Education. \"Floor Area Ratio (FAR).\"\n\nAmerican Planning Association. \"Floor Area Ratio.\"\n\nYour Own Architect. \"What Is the Difference Between Floor Area and Lot Area?\"\n\nBritannica Money. \"Supply and Demand.\"",
