  "definition": "The term \u201cindirect quote\u201d is a currency quotation in the foreign exchange market\u00a0that expresses the variable amount of foreign currency required tobuy or sellone unit of the domestic currency.\n\nAn indirect quote is also known as a \u201cquantity quotation,\u201d since it expresses the quantity of foreign currency required to buy units of the domestic currency. In other words, the domestic currency is thebase currencyin an indirect quote, while the foreign currency is thecounter currency.\n\nAn indirect quote is the opposite, or reciprocal, of adirect quote, also known as a \u201cprice quotation,\u201d which expresses the price of one unit of a foreign currency in terms of a variable number of units of the domestic currency.\n\nAs the U.S. dollar (USD) is the dominant currency in global foreign exchange markets, the convention is to generally use direct quotes that have the U.S. dollar as the base currency and other currencies\u2014like the Canadian dollar (CAD), Japanese yen (JPY), and Indian rupee (INR)\u2014as the counter currency. Exceptions to this rule are theeuroand Commonwealth currencies like the British pound (GBP), Australian dollar (AUD), and New Zealand dollar (NZD), which are typically quoted in indirect form (for example,GBP1 = USD 1.30).\n\nConsider the example of the CAD, which we assume is trading at 1.2500 to the U.S. dollar. In Canada, the indirect form of this quote would be C$1 = US$0.8000 (i.e., 1/1.2500). However, the conventional quotation inforeign exchange marketsis 1.2500, which is an indirect quote from the U.S. perspective because it shows how much of a foreign currency (CAD) is required to get 1 USD. Conversely, USD 0.8000 would be a direct quote.\n\nIn an indirect quote, a lowerexchange rateimplies that the domestic currency is depreciating, or becoming weaker. Continuing with the above example, if the USD/CAD quotation now changes to US$1 = C$1.2300 (indirect quote), then that means the USD (domestic currency) has gotten weaker as less CAD would be needed to get 1 USD. The direct quote, which is 0.8130 (1/1.2300), shows that 1 CAD will get you USD 0.8130, as opposed to 0.8000.\n\nWhat about cross-currency rates, which express the price of one currency in terms of acurrency other than the U.S. dollar? A trader or investors should first ascertain which type of quotation is being used\u2014direct or indirect\u2014to price the cross-rate accurately.\n\nFor example, if USD/JPY is quoted at 100, and USD/CAD is quoted at 1.2700, what is the quotation of CAD/JPY from both the Canadian and Japanese perspectives?\n\nCAD/JPY (conventional quote) = USD/JPY \u00f7 USD/CAD\n\nSo, if domestic currency is CAD, then:\n\n1 CAD (indirect) = 100 \u00f7 1.2700 = 78.74 JPY\n\nif domestic currency is JPY, then:\n\n1 JPY (indirect) = 1.2700 \u00f7 100 = 0.0127 CAD\n\nYes. An indirect quote is also known as a \u201cquantity quotation,\u201d since it expresses the quantity of foreign currency required to buy units of the domestic currency.\n\nIn an indirect quote, a lower exchange rate implies that the domestic currency is depreciating, or becoming weaker.\n\nAn indirect quote is the opposite, or reciprocal, of a direct quote, also known as a \u201cprice quotation,\u201d which expresses the price of one unit of a foreign currency in terms of a variable number of units of the domestic currency.\n\nAn indirect quote in the foreign exchange market expresses the variable amount of foreign currency required to buy or sell one unit of the domestic currency. It is also known as a \u201cquantity quotation,\u201d since it expresses the quantity of foreign currency required to buy units of the domestic currency.",
