  "term": "What Is a General Manager?",
  "definition": "A general manager (GM) is responsible for all or part of a department's operations or the company's operations, including generating revenue and controlling costs. In small companies, the general manager may be one of the top executives.\n\nIn hierarchical organizations, GMs rank above most employees but below corporate-level executives. The responsibility and importance associated with the position may vary among companies and often depend on the organization's structure.\n\nThe GM supervises\u00a0lower-level managers. These lower-level managers may be in charge of several smaller divisions but report directly to the GM. The GM gives specific directions to each department head. As part of this supervision, ageneral manageroversees lower-level managers'\u00a0hiring, training, and coaching. In addition, the GM may lay out incentives for workers\u00a0and assess the departments' efficiency while offering strategic business plans based on company goals.\n\nThe general manager is responsible for all aspects of a business, includingdaily operations, administrative functions, and finances. Because of the enormity of the role, a big part of the job is effective delegation.\n\nTo achieve goals, GMs collaborate with higher-level managers and executives and with the employees that they supervise. This person is responsible for budgeting resources for marketing, supplies, equipment, and hiring. Because of their high level of responsibility, complex duties, and the need for extensive relevant experience, GMs earn more than entry-level employees.\n\nA GM typically gains experience in a lower-level management position before being hired or promoted to GM. GMs can advance by moving into top executive positions or to larger and more prestigious companies. They must thoroughly understand their departments or company's operations, be skilled at managing and leading employees, and make sound decisions for the company.

But, overall, their role is the same: to oversee general operations and manage high-level functions, such as finances, marketing, and staffing. In thec-suite, the chief executive\u00a0officer (CEO) is considered the GM overseeing the entire company. At the departmental level, the GM might oversee a specific process in a company or be in charge of a particular unit or segment.\n\nThe GM sits just below the CEO in the executive suite in terms of rank. A GM runs a line of business, whereas the CEO is the GM of all lines of business in a company.\n\nFor example, the GM is sometimes referred to as the product manager at technology companies. The GM of a bank at a specific location is called thebranch manager. In a services company providing consulting or similar services, a GM might use the title of managing partner or managing director. Consumer-focused\u00a0companies selling products tend to call their GMs\u00a0brand managers.\n\nOperations managers have a similar job to GMs. Like GMs, operations managers create strategies that increase efficiency and profit for a company. They also work with several departments to maintain the overall effectiveness of the business.\n\nPay for general managers varies by industry and company, but theBureau of Labor Statisticshas published data for average general manager pay for industries with the highest GM employment levels:\n\nThe wage estimates for general and operations managers by percentile are:\n\nGeneral managers are found in many industries, so the outlook is fair. Overall, general manager employment is expected to increase by 4.2% through 2032, but significant changes are anticipated in several industries. Here are a few:\n\nFossil fuels, apparel, traditional printing, physical stores, and other traditional general manager employers are expected to reduce their number of GMs. This is likely due to the trends in technology, a switch to green energy, a focus on health and corporate social responsibility, and the large switch in consumer behavior to online shopping.\n\nThere is still plenty of employment opportunity as a general manager, however. Wind andsolar powergeneration, electric component manufacturing, passenger transportation, and many others are expected to grow from a few percent to more than 30%.\n\nTopping general manager employment expectations by 2032 is geothermal electric power generation general managers, with an anticipated 65.3% increase in employment. In addition, general managers in arts and entertainment, performing arts, sports, event promoters, artists, writers, and amusement parks are expected to grow between 8% and 12% by 2032.\n\nGeneral managers are people who manage several different departments within a company. One of their largest responsibilities is overseeing their departments, sections, or work site. They coordinate duties and ensure their departments are on track to accomplish the goals set by the executives.\n\nA chief executive officer is the top leadership position in a company. CEOs are responsible for strategic planning, long-term decision-making, operational oversight, and fiscal oversight.\n\nWhile a GM is responsible for all aspects of a business, an operations manager is only responsible for operations and production. A GM's responsibilities are broader in scope and include HR, marketing, and strategy.\n\nAn operations manager's role tends to be more specific, with experience in a particular niche industry.\n\nA general manager oversees a workforce, budgets for the work that needs to be done, ensures the company is staffed, and many other higher-level business functions.\n\nGeneral managers usually have several lower-level managers reporting to them, so it can be a high position. They are not executive-level, but usually, they report to the executives.\n\nThe level each manager is at varies by business structure and industry. For instance, in a company with divisions and departments, managers supervise employees at the division level, whereas a general manager would manage at the department level.\n\nGeneral managers oversee daily operations and budgets and ensure company goals are met. Most GMs require progressive management experience and a college-level degree in business or their field.\n\nThe job outlook for GMs is high in certain industries and low in others, but these highly skilled professionals will be in demand and remain very well paid for their work in the foreseeable future.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"11-1021 General and Operations Managers.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Employment Projections: 11-1021 General and Operations Managers.\"",
