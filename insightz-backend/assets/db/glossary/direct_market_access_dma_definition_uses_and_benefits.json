  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nDirect market access (DMA) refers to access to the electronic facilities and order books of financial market exchanges that facilitate daily securities transactions. Direct market access requires a sophisticated technology infrastructure and is often owned bysell-side firms. Rather than relying on market-making firms and broker-dealers to execute trades, somebuy-side firmsuse direct market access to place trades themselves.\n\nDirect market access is the direct connection to financial market exchanges that makes the completion of a financial market transaction final. Exchanges are organized marketplaces where stocks, commodities, derivatives, and other financial instruments are traded.\n\nSome of the most well-known exchanges are the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Nasdaq, and the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Individual investors typically do not have direct market access to the exchanges. While trade execution is usually immediately enacted, the transaction is fulfilled by an intermediary brokerage firm.\n\nWhile brokerage firms can work on amarket-makingquote basis, it has become more common since the 1990s for brokerage platforms to use direct market access for completing the trade. With direct market access, the trade is executed at the final market transaction phase by the brokerage firm.\n\nThe order is accepted by the exchange for which the security trades and the transaction is recorded on the exchange's order book. Intermediary brokerage firms are known to have direct market access for completing trade orders. In the broad market, various entities can own and operate direct market access platforms.\n\nBroker-dealersand\u00a0market-making\u00a0firms have direct market access. Sell-side investment banks are also known for having direct market access. Sell-side investment banks have trading groups that execute trades with direct market access.\n\nIn the financial markets, sell-side firms offer their direct market access trading platforms and technology to buy-side firms who wish to control the direct market access trading activities for their investment portfolios.\n\nExamples of buy-side entities includehedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, life insurance companies, andprivate equity funds. This form of control over trading activities is considered sponsored access.\n\nThe technology and infrastructure required to develop a direct market access trading platform can be expensive to build and maintain.\n\nCompanies that offer direct market access sometimes combine this service with access to advanced trading strategies such asalgorithmic trading. Thus, there are agreements between direct market access platform owners and sponsored firms that outline the services offered and the stipulations of the agreement.\n\nWith direct market access, a trader has full transparency of an exchange\u2019sorder bookand all of its trade orders. Direct market access platforms can be integrated with sophisticated algorithmic trading strategies that can streamline the trading process for greater efficiency and cost savings.\n\nDirect market access allows buy-side firms to often execute\u00a0trades\u00a0with lower costs. Order execution is extremely fast, so traders are better able to take advantage of very short-lived trading opportunities.\n\nMarket regulators such as theFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)oversee all of the market\u2019s trading activities and have raised some concerns over the sharing or sponsored access agreements offered by sell-side firms.\n\nIf a buy-side firm does not have direct market access, then it must partner with a sell-side\u00a0firm, brokerage, or bank with direct market access to determine a trading price and execute the final transaction.\n\nFINRA's concern stems from the potential market disruption that could occur if poorly regulated direct market access results in trading errors caused by computers or humans. The damage from these trading errors could be compounded by high-speed trading automation and high-volume trading.\n\nTo address these trading risks, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires firms that provide direct market access to maintain a system of risk management controls over the trading actions allowed through sponsored access.\n\nA direct market access order is a trade placed by a trader directly with an exchange on its order books without having to go through a brokerage as an intermediary. This allows transparency, efficiency, and better pricing for the trader.\n\nThe Market Access Rule is Rule 15c3-5, which requires institutions with market access or that provide market access to clients to \"appropriately control the risks associated with market access so as not to jeopardize their own financial condition, that of other market participants, the integrity of trading on the securities markets, and the stability of the financial system.\"\n\nDirect market access (DMA) differs from over-the-counter (OTC) in that DMA places trades directly with an exchange while OTC happens outside of exchanges and directly between parties. DMA offers more transparency, liquidity, regulation, and better pricing.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions provide clients with direct market access to electronic facilities and order books of exchanges to facilitate and complete trade orders. With the advent of electronic trading, direct market access has made the process of executing trades much more efficient for traders as they can gain access directly without having to rely on an intermediary.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Market Access.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Responses to Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Risk Management Controls for Brokers or Dealers With Market Access.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Market Access Rule.\"",
