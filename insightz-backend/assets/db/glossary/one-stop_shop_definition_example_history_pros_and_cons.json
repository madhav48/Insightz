  "definition": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA one-stop shop is a business that offers a multitude of products or services to its customers, all under one roof. A one-stop shop can refer to a single physical location where the business can be carried out or it can refer to a company that handles a variety of goods or services. One-stop shops tend to be more convenient for customers as they don't have to go to multiple businesses to meet their needs.Big-box retailers, department stores, ande-commercesites are often considered one-stop shops.\n\nAs noted above, the term one-stop shop refers to abusinessthat offers different goods and services\u2014usually in one location. This can be under one roof in a physical store or through a single website like Amazon (AMZN).\n\nThe concept of the one-stop shop expanded over time to include business services. The nuance also shifted from a wide product offering to capture more of the customer's grocery purchase to offering all the complementary products and services to a client in a particular area. For example, the 1980s saw the rise offinancial supermarkets. Brokerages likeMerrill Lynchbegan expanding into retail banking, insurance products,credit cards, and even real estate services.\n\nThe business strategy behind the modernized concept of a one-stop shop is to provide convenient and efficient service that will create the opportunity for the company to sell more to customers. This way a company can growrevenueby selling more to existing customers in addition to growth from new customers.\n\nThe terms full service (as in full-service broker) andturnkey operationare sometimes synonymously with one-stop shop.\n\nThe term one-stop shop may have first used been in conjunction with businesses that did all the work for that new staple of American life, the car\u2014from sales to repairs to parts. One such firm was the Western Auto Supply.\n\nThe concept dates back to early 20th-century America when a shopping trip meant going all over town to pick up meat from the butchers, vegetables from the Haymarket, and bread from the bakery\u2014and that was just for groceries. Hardware supplies, cleaning supplies, and other household items required visits to even more places.\n\nThen, as now, people wanted to save time, so stores responded by stocking a wider range of products so consumers only had to come to their location to check off the majority of their shopping lists. Companies took note and began changing the way they did business. For instance:\n\nThere are some obvious advantages to a one-stop shop for consumers as well as the businesses operating them. Convenience is a big one. If the firm that does your taxes can also help you with yourestate planningand investing strategy, it saves you from having to deal with multiple companies.\n\nFrom the firm's perspective, seeing all those aspects of your life also allows it to better tailor services in all areas to you. If the firm sees that your tax bill is going up, they can suggest strategies tominimize the taxescoming from your investments.\n\nA high level of trust grows over time when a consumer uses a particular business more and builds a personal connection with it. There may be loyalty perks for the consumer, and the business gains a higher degree of confidence that the customer won't fly to another provider based on price alone.\n\nExpanding the offerings of products and services can provide a steady revenue stream for businesses. This is especially true when times are tough since offering a variety of goods and services at different price points ensures that consumers are still shopping.\n\nThe downside of the one-stop shop is embodied in the saying, \"Jack of all, master of none.\" While various services and abilities offered at a single institution are probably competent, they may not be as expert or as inventive as those offered by professionals specializing in different fields of tax, law, or investing.\n\nA client's options and choices may be limited not only to certain employees but also to its proprietary products and services. Dealing with a one-stop shop may save money, thanks to the firm'seconomies of scale, but then again, it may not. The convenience of the one-stop usually comes with a cost.\n\nFrom the shop's point of view, there are natural limitations on how many products and services one company can offer to a customer while maintaining superior quality. Some companies expand their suite of services too broadly, eroding thecore servicesthat made them outstanding to that customer in the first place.\n\nBusinesses can tailor services to consumers' needs\n\nSteady revenue stream and foot traffic\n\nConsumer choice may be limited to what a one-stop shop offers\n\nToo many offerings may erode quality of core services\n\nWe've noted several historical examples of one-stop shops above, including Piggly Wiggly andJ.C. Penney. But there are others in different industries and markets.\n\nFor instance, many banks offer their customers a range of services, including basic banking, lending,investment adviceand services, andinsurance policies. Major financial institutions like Bank of America (BAC), Ally, and Wells Fargo (WFC) are common examples of financial institutions that are one-stop shops. These firms can increase their business (and their profits) while saving their customers a lot of time and effort.\n\nMany healthcare facilities also operate as one-stop shops. A healthcare center that provides patients with routine and emergency care, lab and imaging services, and a pharmacy is also considered a one-stop shop.\n\nThere are many examples of one-stop shops. Grocery stores are considered one-stop shops for foodstuffs, as they offer meat, produce, fresh and frozen options, and prepared foods. Financial institutions that offer retail and commercial banking, lending, investment, and insurance are also considered one-stop shops. Other examples include big-box stores like Costco and Walmart as they offer a variety of goods and services.\n\nAmazon is often considered to be a one-stop shop because it offers a variety of goods and services to consumers. For instance, the e-commerce site sells household goods, clothing and footwear, streaming services, music, groceries, pharmaceuticals, and electronic devices. The company expanded its offerings since it was established. In 1995, Amazon began as an online bookstore.\n\nOne-stop shops benefit consumers and businesses. Consumers are given a convenient experience because they only have to visit one location to meet their needs. For instance, they can shop for groceries, household items, clothing, and other items from a big-box store. Businesses benefit because they can attract more consumers and generate a steady revenue stream from a wide customer base.\n\nOne-stop shops have changed the way we shop for our goods and services. Before grocery stores, big-box stores, financial supermarkets, and e-commerce sites, consumers had to visit multiple businesses to meet their needs. But, now that companies have expanded their offerings, consumers can save time and money by visiting a single location. In order to build a loyal customer base, though, businesses should remember not to sacrifice quality for profits.\n\nUniversity of Illinois Law Review. \"The Transformation of the U.S. Financial Services Industry, 1975-2000: Competition, Consolidation, and Increased Risks, \" Page 251-255.\n\nAvis H.
