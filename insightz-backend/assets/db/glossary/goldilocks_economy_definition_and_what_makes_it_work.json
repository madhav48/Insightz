  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA Goldilocks economy is not too hot nor too cold but just right, to steal a line from the popular children's story \"Goldilocks and the Three Bears\". The term describes an ideal state for an economic system. There'sfull employment, economic stability, and stable growth in this perfect state. The economy isn't expanding or contracting by a large margin.\n\nA Goldilocks economy is warm enough with steady economic growth to prevent arecessionbut growth isn't so hot as to push it into an inflationary status.\n\nThere's some debate among economists as to the exact characteristics of a Goldilocks economy but it's safe to say that there should be a balance between growth, employment, and inflation. The ideal conditions are typically characterized by:\n\nThe economy can dip into a recession or an economic downturn if GDP growth is too low. Economists say that the country is experiencing a recession when an economy registers two consecutive quarters or six months of negative GDP growth. But it can lead to a surge in prices in an economy or inflation if GDP growth is too fast.\n\nFiscal spending by Congress is one way to help create and manage a Goldilocks economy. Governments can boost their spending through infrastructure projects such as the creation of roads and bridges as well as by writing government contracts with private companies.\n\nThe use oftaxesis also a tool employed to manage an economy. The reduction of taxes on businesses encourages business investment. Consumer tax cuts encourageconsumer spending. But fiscal spending and tax cuts can have mixed results. They're rarely a long-term solution to maintaining the Goldilocks economy.\n\nA Goldilocks economy is transitional because economic activity is a process of expansion and contraction that occurs repeatedly. Theboom-and-bust cycleis a key characteristic of capitalist economies.\n\nThe U.S. economy typically goes through five phases as part of thebusiness cycle. These stages are growth or expansion, peak, recession or contraction, trough, and recovery. A Goldilocks economy might happen during the recovery and growth phases. It should be considered a temporary state because of the existence of the business cycles.\n\nCentral banks are responsible for regulating money supply and the banking sector. The banking authority usesmonetary policytools to bring on and maintain a Goldilocks economy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve (Fed) is the U.S. central bank. The Fed can cut interest rates, spurring lending in the economy as consumers and businesses increase borrowing to take advantage of lower rates. It can increase interest rates if it feels that the economy is growing too hot and inflation is rising at a faster rate than the Fed'sinflation target.\n\nRising prices can hurt an economy because they tend to lead consumers to cut back on spending. Companies get hurt by inflation if theirraw materialsbecome too expensive because the added costs eat into their profits. Businesses can cut investment as a result.\n\nCentral banks such as the Fed react by increasing interest rates to slow the growth in an economy, which ultimately slows or prevents inflationary pressures. But their actions can trigger an economic slowdown if they raise interest rates too soon or by too much.\n\nEconomic conditions abroad and the response from foreign governments and other national central banks can also influence whether an economy can reach a Goldilocks state.\n\nA Goldilocks economy is ideal for investing. Stocks perform well as companies grow and generate positiveearningsgrowth. The investor gains through share price appreciation and dividends in some cases as the business returns profits to its shareholders.Fixed-incomeinvestments such as bonds will hold their value in the absence of inflation.\n\nBut the economy can overheat if GDP grows too quickly and inflation creeps up too rapidly. Asset prices can become overvalued in this atmosphere. The Fed may raise interest rates to try to cool down the economy. Rising interest rates break one of the key pillars of the Goldilocks economy and are usually a precursor to its end.\n\nEconomist David Shulman is widely considered to have coined the phrase \"Goldilocks economy\" in an article published in 1992, \"The Goldilocks Economy: Keeping the Bears at Bay.\" The U.S. economy of the middle to the late 1990s was considered a Goldilocks economy because it was \"not too hot, not too cold, but just right,\" a phrase that has been used to describe the ideal economy for investors.\n\nThe term has also been used to describe the U.S. economy as it recovered from the bursting of thedot-com bubblebetween 2004 and 2005. The economy grew at 4.3% in 2005, putting theDow Jones Industrial Average(DJIA) near multi-year highs for that time.\n\nMarket participants considered it to be a Goldilocks economy in 2017 with the economy growing at nearly 4%, employment between 3% and 4%, and no real inflation in sight.The Fed hiked interest rates later that year to keep inflation and growth at moderate levels. The global economy was averaging over 3% GDP growth at the time.\n\nThere's no cited statistical difference between a recession and a depression but the degree of severity is the differentiating factor. A recession is marked by a drop in economic activity over at least a few months. A depression occurs when the drop is significantly more severe.\n\nThe most severe unemployment in the U.S. is said to have occurred in 1933 during the Great Depression. The rate hit 24.9% in that year.\n\nCompare that to 3.9% in April 2024.\n\nInflation occurs with an increase in prices for goods and services that's sustained over time. Deflation occurs when the inflation rate drops below zero to a negative percentage. This must also be sustained over time. The process of the fall in prices from Point A to Point B is referred to as disinflation.\n\nIt can be challenging for central bankers and governments to engineer a Goldilocks economy because many factors must come together for this economic state to exist. The unemployment rate, the inflation rate, market interest rates, inflation rate, and gross domestic product (GDP) must all be in ideal, healthy condition. It can\u2019t just be a flash in the pan but should be a steady economic environment.\n\nA Goldilocks economy can provide an ideal time for investing but be cautious and keep an eye on the contributing data.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"What Is the New Normal Unemployment Rate?\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"Setting the Interest Rate.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Monetary Policy and Central Banking.\"\n\nCNN Money. \"A Perfect GDP Report.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Great Recession, Great Recovery?
