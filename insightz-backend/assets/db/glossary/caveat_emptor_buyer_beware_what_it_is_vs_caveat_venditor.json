  "term": "Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware): What It Is, vs. Caveat Venditor",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nCaveat emptor, a Latin phrase meaning \"let the buyer beware,\" implies that buyers take the risk in a transaction. Potential buyers are warned by the phrase to do their research and ask pointed questions of the seller. The seller isn't responsible for problems that the buyer encounters with the product after the sale.\n\nCaveat emptor is sometimes used in legal contracts as a type of disclaimer. In many jurisdictions, it is the contract law principle that places the onus on the buyer to performdue diligencebefore making a purchase.\n\nThe term is commonly used inreal propertytransactions. It relates to adverse situations that may arise with real estate after the date of closing. It also applies to transactions that involve other types of goods, such as cars or items at thrift stores or yard sales.\n\nCaveat emptor is intended to preclude post-purchase disputes arising frominformation asymmetry, a situation in which the seller has more information than the buyer about the quality of a good or service.\n\nFor example, if Hasan\u00a0wants to buy a car from Allison, and caveat emptor applies, he is responsible for gathering the necessary information to make an informed purchase. In gathering this information, Hassan may decide to ask Allison how many miles the car has on it, whether any major components need to be replaced, whether it's been serviced regularly, and more. If he buys the car for the asking price, making little or no effort to assess its true condition or value, and the car subsequently breaks down, Allison is not technically liable for damages.\n\nHowever, in practice, there are exceptions to this principle. Caveat emptor doesn't give sellers carte blanche to promote a fraudulent transaction. For example, if Allison lied about the car's mileage, maintenance history, or repair needs, she would have committedfraud. In theory, Hasan would be entitled to damages.\n\nCaveat emptor can apply in real estate\u00a0transactions involving previously owned houses in all U.S. states. Therefore, buyers need to make every effort to discover any and all property defects. They might hire a highly ratedhouse inspectorto help.\n\nHowever, in the majority of states, this principle is not necessarily business as usual. What's more, within the U.S., home builders are required to issue animplied warrantyof fitness to buyers of new properties. These properties come with the expectation that the seller is liable for faults.\n\nMarket forces and other factors can reduce the feasibility of caveat emptor in some cases. For example, withreal estate, because a seller typically knows the condition of a property better than a buyer, legal decisions relating to quality issues have begun to favor the buyers.There are other ways that buyers can feel more assured of quality.\n\nWarrantiesare guarantees of quality or satisfaction that sellers issue voluntarily to buyers. If sellers provide a quality product, they will not need to provide refunds or replacements very often. Buyers will be inclined to choose those vendors that provide a perception of quality or a warranty.\n\nThere are several types of implied warranties:\n\nThese laws have been enacted for the protection of consumers buying certain goods and services, especially since the2008 financial crisis. For instance, financial services institutions know much more information about their products and services than their customers do. This information can relate to fees, responsibilities, risks, and benefits. TheTruth in Lending Act (TILA)requires financial services providers to inform consumers of the terms and costs of consumer credit products.\n\nInformal transactions such as the one between Allison and Hasan\u00a0are usually unregulated. However, the U.S. government pushes back against the principle of caveat emptor to protect consumers' interests in more than just the financial services industry. Many other industries must provide buyers clear, largely standardized information about a product or service.\n\nAt the same time,safe harbor statementsand legally mandated quarterly reports can reinforce the principle of caveat emptor. Many companies continue to promote the expectation that buyers have access to all the information they need to make a reasonably informed decision.\n\nIf you see the term \"as is\" on the tag of any item for sale, caveat emptor applies. Be sure to examine the item carefully and to your satisfaction. Ask the seller questions about condition. Once you buy it, you cannot return it for a refund.\n\nMost states don't uniformly apply caveat emptor, offering buyers some assurance of product/service protection. However, the courts in the states below still tend to uphold it for real estate transactions.\n\nCaveat emptor refers to instances when buyers must be vigilant about researching the condition of an item for sale. The seller has no responsibility for after-sale problems that occur.\n\nHowever, a different phrase often applies to sales in the U.S. nowadays. It's caveat venditor and it translates to \"let the seller beware.\" Times have changed and goods and services are often covered by an\u00a0implied warranty.\n\nUnless they're labeled \"sold as is\" or some other understanding between the buyer and seller is reached, most consumer products are guaranteed to function when used for their intended purpose.\n\nWhile caveat emptor places the responsibility on the buyer to ensure a product\u2019s quality, there are exceptions. If the seller misrepresents or fails to disclose vital information about the product, the buyer may have legal grounds for a dispute. Additionally, in many jurisdictions, consumer protection laws, warranties, and product guarantees provide buyers with extra safeguards, reducing the full impact of caveat emptor.\n\nCaveat emptor isn\u2019t inherently wrong, but it puts an unfair burden on consumers, particularly in cases where products are complex or hard to evaluate, such as financial products or technology. While it\u2019s understandable for thrift shop or garage sale purchases, it\u2019s less reasonable when applied to modern consumer goods or services where quality assurance is expected.\n\nToday, caveat venditor (\"let the seller beware\") is more often the principle applied. It reflects the modern shift toward consumer protection, with warranties, product guarantees, and regulations ensuring that sellers are accountable for their goods and services.\n\nCaveat emptor is a Latin phrase that translates to \u201clet the buyer beware.\u201d In use for hundreds of years in the U.S., it puts the burden of researching the quality of products and services on the buyer in a transaction. It's often used when selling previously owned real estate.\n\nThese days, caveat emptor isn't applied very often to other types of transactions. That's due to regulations that are intended to provide consumers with more information and protection. It's more likely that caveat venditor, or \"let the seller beware,\" applies.\n\nRocket Mortgage. \"Caveat Emptor: What Does It Mean In Real Estate?\"\n\nWeinberger, Alan M. \"Let the Buyer Be Well Informed? - Doubting the Demise of Caveat Emptor.\"Maryland Law Review, vol. 55, no. 2, 1996, pp. 388-389.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Implied Warranty.\"\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"Truth in Lending Act.\"\n\nNigam, Shalu. \"From Caveat Emptor to Caveat Venditor: The Consumer Protection Act 2019 And the Consumer Rights.\"Legal News and Views, vol. 34, no. 3, October 2020, pp. 2-7.\n\nFredericks, Barbara. \"Commercial Law - Implied Warranties in Sales of Real Estate - The Trend to Abolish Caveat Emptor.\"DePaul Law Review, vol. 22, no. 2, Winter 1973, pp. 510-523.",
