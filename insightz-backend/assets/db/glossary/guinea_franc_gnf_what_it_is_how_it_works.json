  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nGNF is the currency abbreviation for the Guinea franc, the national currency of the Republic of Guinea, a country in West Africa.\n\nThe Republic of Guinea was formerly known as French Guinea; today it is often referred to as Guinea-Conakry, which refers to the name of its capital city to distinguish it from its neighboring country Guinea-Bissau. As of August 2023, US $1 is equal to roughly 8,586 GNF.\n\nThe GNF is actually the second franc used as a currency in the country. Guinea was a French colony and gained its independence in 1958. Prior to this, the currency used in Guinea was the CFA franc, which\u2014between 1945 and 1958\u2014was an abbreviation for the franc for \u201ccolonies fran\u00e7aises d'Afrique,\u201d or former French colonies in Africa.\n\nIn 1959, after Guinea\u2019s independence, the first Guinean franc was issued as the country\u2019s currency.It was then replaced by the Guinean syli, which was used in the country from 1971 to 1985. In 1985, the second Guinean franc replaced the syli at par.\n\nGuinea's economy is fueled by a rich reserve of minerals, gold, high-grade iron ore, and diamonds. Additionally, it boasts the one of the world\u2019s largest reserves of bauxite, which is one of the main exports for the West African nation.\n\nHowever, the country, which has a GDP of $16.1 billion as of 2021, has faced stalled economic growth because of political instability.Additionally, the Ebola virus slowed down Guinea\u2019s economic growth in 2014 and 2015.However, the country\u2019s GDP grew by 3.9% in 2021 ; the most recent year for which official data is available.\n\nGuinea used to be part of the franc zone of former French colonies, using theCFA francas its official currency until its independence. Many of its neighboring nations\u201414 West African countries in total, 12 of which are former French colonies\u2014still use the CFA franc. Together, they make up the African Financial Community.\n\nThe CFA was created in 1945, after World War II, to keep from devaluing money in French colonies. Prior to this, currencies in the French colonies were pegged to theFrench franc, which was devalued with the signing of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944.\n\nWhen it was introduced in 1945, the exchange rate was 1 CFA to 1.70 French francs, shifting from 1 CFA to 2 French francs in 1948.The currency kept parity when France switched its currency from the French franc to the euro. The current fixed exchange rate for the CFA to theeurois 1 euro to 655.96 CFA francs.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
