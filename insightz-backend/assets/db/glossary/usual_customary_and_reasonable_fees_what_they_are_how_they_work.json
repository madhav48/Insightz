  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nUsual, customary and reasonable (UCR) fees are\u00a0out-of-pocket fees that a health\u00a0insurance policyholder must pay for services. UCR fees\u00a0are based on the services provided to policyholders, as well as the area of the country where the services are being provided.\n\nA fee is considered usual, customary and reasonable if:\n\nUCR fees are monitored by the insurance company, which determines whether they make sense when compared to what doctors in the area are charging. If a doctor charges more than what the insurance company determines to be usual, customary and reasonable, the policyholder may be responsible for the difference between the amount charged for the service and the amount covered by the insurance company.\n\nThe amount of usual, customary and reasonable fees that are charged for services depends on a variety of factors, and the conditions under which a UCR fee is charged are outlined in the policy. Many medical insurance policies, for example, break providers into \u201cnetwork\u201d and \u201cout of network\u201d groupings. Using an in-network provider may result in no UCR fees being charged, but using an out-of-network doctor may result in the policyholder is responsible for some or even all of the service costs.\n\nMany policyholders only think about the cost of medical services after the service is provided, and can be caught off guard when their insurance doesn\u2019t cover all expenses. In order to mitigate the possibility of a big bill, policyholders should check whether a doctor is in the insurer\u2019s network, talk to the doctor about the cost of any service before the service is provided, and ask the insurer how much of the fee will be covered.\n\nMedicare\u00a0UCR charges are not regulated by state or federal agencies, but Medicare does publish its UCR fee schedule. This is commonly referred to as \"Medicare Allowable\" charges. Providers who participate withMedicareagree to accept the Medicare allowable charge as full payment. Patients are still\u00a0responsible for their co-insurance and deductible.\n\nMedicare providers may choose not to bill the patient for amounts above the Medicare allowable fee schedule. It is important to verify that a\u00a0provider \"Accepts Medicare Assignment\" or is a \"Medicare Provider\" to avoid unexpected and potentially large out-of-pocket expenses.",
