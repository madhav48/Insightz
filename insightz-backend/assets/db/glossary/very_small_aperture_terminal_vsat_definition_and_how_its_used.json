  "term": "Very Small Aperture Terminal (VSAT): Definition and How It's Used",
  "definition": "A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a two-way ground station\u00a0that transmits and receives data from satellites. A VSAT is less than three meters tall and is capable of both narrow and broadband data to satellites in orbit in real-time. The data can\u00a0then be redirected to other remote terminals or hubs around the planet.\n\nVSAT\u00a0networks have a number of commercial applications, including, perhaps most notably,enterprise resource planning(ERP). The use of VSAT\u00a0to trackinventorywas one of the many innovations Walmart pioneered in retail to effectively manage its vast inventory in real-time and reduce delivery costs between the warehouse and\u00a0stores.\n\nCombined with thehub systemof inventory storage, VSAT\u00a0allowed Walmart to stock its stores more precisely and reduce how many times a product had to move between locations before being sold. Other manufacturers use VSAT\u00a0to relay orders, check production figures in real-time as well as other functions that are otherwise\u00a0handled over a wired network.\n\nTheNational Stock Exchange (NSE) of Indiahas one of the largest VSAT\u00a0networks in the world and offers it as one of its connectivity options. VSAT\u00a0provided the NSE with a way to offer access in areas where wired options are limited. With the exception of the occasional\u00a0sun outage due to solar radiation distorting signals from the satellite, the VSAT\u00a0network has held up.\n\nVSAT\u00a0networks have a big advantage when it comes to deployment. Because the ground station is communicating with satellites, there is lessinfrastructurerequired to service remote locations. This was one of the reasons Walmart chose VSAT\u00a0as it started out heavily leveraged to rural America, where telecommunications infrastructure was less dense than in the cities.\n\nThis has made VSAT\u00a0networks an ideal choice for providing connectivity to remote work sites, such as exploratory drilling sites that need to relay daily drill logs back to headquarters. VSAT\u00a0is also independent of local telecommunications networks, making it an ideal system to back up wired systems and reducebusiness recovery risk. If the wired network goes down, a business can still go on using the VSAT\u00a0network.\n\nHowever, VSAT\u00a0does have limitations. The most obvious is latency, as it takes time for information to reach the dish and the station due to one part of the system being way up in geosynchronous\u00a0orbit above the earth.\n\nIn other words, protocols that require a lot of back and forth communication rather than one-way data transfer experience lag. The signal quality can also be affected by the weather and other buildings getting in the way.",
