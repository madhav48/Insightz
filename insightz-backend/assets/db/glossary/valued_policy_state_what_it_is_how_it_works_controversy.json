  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nValued policy law (VPL) is a legal statute that requires insurance companies to pay thefull valueof a policy to the insured in the event of atotal loss. Valued policy law does not consider the actual cash value of the insured property at the time of the loss; instead, the law mandates total payment.\n\nA valued policy differs from an unvalued, or open, insurance policy, in which the value of the property would need to be proven subsequent to a loss through the production of invoices, estimates, claims adjusters, or other evidence.\n\nA total loss is a loss that occurs when aninsuredproperty is destroyed or damaged to such an extent that it can be neither recovered nor repaired for further use.Often, a total loss triggers the maximum settlement possible according to the terms of the insurance policy.\n\nInsurance policies generally use one of two methods to determine the\u00a0value of a loss: actual cash value orreplacement cost.\n\nIn general, valued policy laws require that\u00a0the amount stated in policy declarations shall be dollar amount paid to the insured\u00a0at the time of loss. If the value of an insured item\u00a0at the time of loss is less than the amount of insurance, the insurer has no recourse to contest payment in full. Moreover, in most valued policy states, any policy provision inconsistent with the valued policy law is considered void.\n\nNot all states within the United States have these laws. States that do have valued policy laws include Arkansas, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin was the first state to pass a Valued Policy Law in 1874.\n\nHurricane Katrina forced the insurance industry in Louisiana to examine the Valued Policy Law; few policyholders were paid their entire coverage amount because of interpretations of the valued policy law.Some insurers claim that the law does not apply because certain losses were a result of a non-covered peril (flood),\u00a0that certain losses were a result of \"mixed causation\" \u2013\u00a0a combination of a covered peril (wind) and a non-covered peril (flood) \u2013\u00a0and that the total loss was offset by other sources including the National FederalFlood InsuranceProgram and FEMA grants.\n\nYale Law School. \"Is There Any Value?\u00a0Reevaluating Homeowners Insurance Valued Policy Laws,\" Pages 2-3.\n\nSouth Carolina Department of Insurance. \"Understanding the Claim Payout Process.\"\n\nProgressive. \"Replacement Cost vs. Actual Cash Value.\"\n\nOhio Insurance Agents. \"What You Need to Know About \u201cValued Policy\u201d States.\"\n\nYale Law School. \"Is There Any Value?\u00a0Reevaluating Homeowners Insurance Valued Policy Laws,\" Page 5.\n\nLoyola University New Orleans. \"Katrina's Impact on Litigation of Insurance Claims Under Louisiana.\"",
