  "term": "Back Office: What It Means in Business, With Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe back office is the portion of a company made up of administration and support personnel who are not client-facing. Back-office functions include settlements, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.\n\nFor example, a financial services firm is often segmented into three parts: thefront office(e.g., sales, marketing, and customer support), themiddle office(risk management), and the back office (administrative and support services).\n\nThe back office can be thought of as the part of a company responsible for providing all business functions related to its operations. Despite their seemingly invisible presence, back-office personnel provide essential functions to the business.\n\nThe back office is a foundational part of any firm, and associated job titles are often classified under \"Operations.\" Their roles enable and equip front-office personnel to perform theirclient-facingduties. The back office sometimes describes all jobs that don't directly generate revenue.\n\nEffectively, the back office finalizes the transactions conducted by the front office. This includes confirming transactions and settlement instructions with the counterparty's back office. The back office is also responsible for trade clearances, record maintenance, accounting, and IT services.\n\nThe term \"back office\" originated when early companies designed their offices so that the physical front portion contained associates who interacted with customers, and the back portion housed associates who had no interaction with customers, such as accounting clerks.\n\nToday, most back-office positions are away from the company headquarters.\u00a0Many are in cities where commercialleasesare inexpensive, labor costs are lower, and an adequate labor pool is available.\n\nAlternatively, many companies have chosen tooutsourceand/or offshore back-office roles to reduce costs.\u00a0Technology has afforded many companies the opportunity to allow remote work arrangements, in which associates work from home. Benefits of those models include rent savings and increased productivity.\u00a0Additionally, remotely employing back-office staff allows companies to access talent in various areas and attract a diverse pool of applicants.\n\nSome companies offer incentives to employees and applicants who accept remote positions.\u00a0For example, a financial services firm that requires high-level accounting could offer a $500-per-month housing subsidy to experiencedcertified public accountants (CPAs)to work from home. If it costs $1,000 per month to secure office space per individual, a housing subsidy of $500 per month would result in an overall savings of $6,000 per year.\u00a0The cost savings can be significant when employing many remote professionals.\n\nThough this saves money for the company, the employee may also have to accept a lower salary if they are moving from a front office position in a central location to a more remote location or even a work-at-home arrangement.\n\nAlthough back-office staff members don't interact with customers, they tend to actively interact with front-office staff.\n\nFor example, a manufacturing equipment salesperson may enlist the help of back-office staff to provide accurate information on inventory and pricing structures.Real estatemarketing professionals frequently interact with sales agents to create attractive and relevant marketing materials. IT professionals regularly work together with all divisions of the company to ensure that systems function properly.\n\nThough it varies from one company to another, the work in their back-office roles is significantly different from the front office, except for corporatecredit riskroles, which may not provide a front-office employee hopeful with the needed experience to make such a transition.\n\nMany business school students from so-called non-target colleges and universities may see back-office work as a way to gain experience within a firm and potentially network up into a front-office role. (Target schools send significant numbers of their students into investment banking each year and have extensive alumni networks in the industry.)\n\nThe front office is responsible for attracting new clients and servicing existing ones; they're the client-facing team. On the other hand, the back office serves the transactions conducted by the front office and has no interaction with the firm's clients. However, some might say the back office's client is the front office.\n\nIn short, the back office exists to finalize the transactions executed by the front office. This can include confirming transactions and settlement instructions with the back office of the other company involved. The back office is also responsible for trade clearances, record maintenance, accounting, and IT services.\n\nBack offices used to be located literally behind the front office or trading desk. These days, many financial corporations have moved their back-office locations to lower-cost sites, such as Florida or North Carolina, where rents and salaries are generally lower than in big cities like New York or Chicago.\n\nIn finance, the back office plays a crucial role in supporting the front office (entities such as sales staff or a trading desk) by processing trades made by bank customers or for the banks' own proprietary trading operations. Some of the back office functions are confirming trades and settlement instructions, clearances, record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, and IT services.\n\nFront office activities couldn't be processed without the back office, and the back office wouldn't exist were it not for the front office's sales and trading activities, making teamwork essential. While frequently unseen, the back office performs critical duties stemming from front-desk activities. However, back-office operations are a cost center, leading many financial firms to relocate their back-office or operations teams to less-expensive locations like Florida or North Carolina, rather than where the head office may be located, for example, New York or Chicago.",
