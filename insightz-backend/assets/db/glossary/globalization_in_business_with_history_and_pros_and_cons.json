As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nGlobalization refers to the growing interconnection of nations' economies. It represents the flow of financial products, goods, technology, information, and jobs across national borders and cultures. In economic terms, it describes an interdependence of countries around the globe fostered throughfree trade.\n\nCorporations gain\u00a0acompetitive advantageon multiple fronts from globalization. They can reduce operating costs by manufacturing abroad, buy raw materials more cheaply because of the reduction or removal oftariffs, and most of all, gain access to millions of new consumers.\n\nGlobalization is a social, cultural, political, and legal phenomenon.\n\nOn the one hand, globalization has\u00a0created new jobs and economic growth through the cross-border flow of goods, capital, and labor. On the other hand, this growth and job creation are not distributed evenly across industries or countries.\n\nSpecific industries in certain countries, such as textile manufacturing in the United States or corn farming in Mexico, have suffered severe disruption or outright collapse as a result of increased international competition.\n\nGlobalization's motives are idealistic, as well as opportunistic, but the development of a global free market has benefited large corporations based in the Western world. Its impact remains mixed for workers, cultures, and small businesses around the globe, in both developed andemerging nations.\n\nGlobalization has grown at an unprecedented pace, with public policy changes and communications technology innovations cited as the two main driving factors.\n\nGlobalization is not a\u00a0new concept. Traders\u00a0traveled vast distances in ancient times to buycommoditiesthat were rare and expensive for sale in their homelands. The Industrial Revolution\u00a0brought advances in transportation and communication in the 19th century that eased trade across borders.\n\nThe\u00a0think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) states globalization stalled after World War I. Nations moved towardprotectionismas they launched import taxes to guard their industries in the aftermath of the conflict. This trend continued through the Great Depression and World War II until the U.S. took on an instrumental role in revivinginternational trade.\n\nOne of the critical steps in the path to globalization came with theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed in 1993.One of NAFTA's many effects was to give American auto manufacturers the incentive to relocate a portion of their manufacturing to Mexico where they could save on the costs of labor.NAFTA was replaced in 2020 by theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMC).\n\nGovernments worldwide have integrated afree marketeconomic system throughfiscal policiesand trade agreements in the 20th century. The core of most trade agreements is the removal or reduction of tariffs.\n\nThis evolution of economic systems has increased industrialization and financial opportunities in many nations. Governments now focus on removing barriers to trade and promoting international commerce.\n\nA larger market for goods and services\n\nOutsourcing can benefit domestic firms and foreign labor\n\nConcentrates wealth in richer countries\n\nSome poorer countries can be left behind\n\nLabor and the physical and intellectual resources of poorer countries can be exploited\n\nRegions and cultures lose their uniqueness and products available around the world can become homogeneous\n\nGlobalization is important as it increases the size of the global market, and allows more and different goods to be produced and sold for cheaper prices. It is also important because it is one of the most powerful forces affecting the modern world, so much so that it can be difficult to make sense of the world without understanding globalization.\n\nFor example, many of the largest and most successful corporations in the world are in effect truly multinational organizations, with offices and supply chains stretched right across the world. These companies would not be able to exist if not for the complex network of trade routes, international legal agreements, and telecommunications infrastructure that were made possible through globalization. Important political developments, such as the ongoing trade conflict between the U.S. and China, are also directly related to globalization.\n\nIt depends. Proponents of globalization will point to the dramatic decline in poverty throughout the world for more than two decades after around year 2000, which many economists attribute in part to increased trade and investment between nations.Similarly, they will argue that globalization has allowed products and services such as cellphones, airplanes, and information technology to be spread far more widely throughout the world.\n\nOn the other hand, critics of globalization will point to the negative impact it has had on specific nations\u2019 industries, which might face increased competition from international firms. Globalization can also have negative environmental impacts due to economic development, industrialization, and international travel.\n\nGlobalization has had a large impact on societies around the world, leading to massive migrations from rural to industrial or urban areas and to the rapid growth of cities and trade hubs. While this has meant an overall increase in incomes and a higher standard of living in general, it has also led to problems such as crime, domestic violence, homelessness, and poverty. Concepts of national identity, national or regional culture, and consumption patterns also change as goods from around the world become increasingly available and at low prices. The competitiveness of global capitalism may also lead to more individualistic ideals that contradict the cultural orientations of certain, more collectivist societies.\n\nA simple example of globalization would be a car manufactured in the U.S. that sources parts from China, Japan, South Korea, Sri Lanka, and South Africa. The car is then exported to Europe, where it is sold to a driver who fills the car's gas tank with gasoline refined from Saudi oil.\n\nGlobalization refers to the ongoing trend of increased interconnectivity of nations across the globe, as enabled by advancements in transportation and information technology, among others.\n\nGlobalization is facilitated economically by free trade agreements, which permit barrier-free imports and exports across borders. While globalization brings many advantages\u2014including lower prices and higher standards of living to some\u2014it also has drawbacks, including wealth concentration and cultural homogeneity.\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics. \"What Is Globalization?\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The North American Free Trade Agreement,\" Page 1.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The North American Free Trade Agreement.\" Pages 16-17.\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\"\n\nFasterCapital. \u201cFinancial Bailout: PIIGS and Financial Bailouts: Lessons From the Crisis.\u201d\n\nMacrotrends. \u201cWorld Poverty Rate 1981-2024.\u201d",
