  "definition": "Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) are people with a net worth of at least $30 million. This category is composed of the wealthiest people in the world. They control a tremendous amount of global wealth. This group of people is small, but it continues to grow.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the group totaled 626,600 individuals globally, up 4.2% from a year earlier, according to Knight Frank's 2024 Wealth Report.\n\nThe U.S. is home to the most UHNWIs: 208,560. The global total is about 626,600 UHNWIs. Though Latin America lost UHNWIs, North America and the Middle East grew by 7.2% and 6.2%, respectively. Europe is still home to the wealthiest 1%.\n\nWomen comprise about 11% of UHNWIs globally, according to Altrata.\u00a0And there has been a 38% rise in female UHNWIs over the past decade, according to Knight Frank.\n\n22% of UHNWIs plan tobuy a homethis year, though this is more popular amongmillennialsthanbaby boomers.\n\nMany of the world's super-rich citizens are self-made individuals. This is evident in Forbes' annually curated list of theworld's richest people. On its World's Real-Time Billionaires List, the magazine ranks the daily worth on its wealth-tracking platform. According to the website, \"[The list] reflects changes since 5 pm EST of [the] prior trading day.\"\n\nOn Forbes' ever-changing list, on October 7, 2024, Elon Musk led the billionaire pack with $262.6 billion.

Many ultra-high-net-worth individuals store the majority of their wealth in:\n\nWhen Forbes published its list of billionaires for 2024, it pointed out that two-thirds of the billionaires on the list are worth more than they were a year prior, while one-fourth of them are worse off.\n\nNet worthis the combined value of all of your assets. How much you need to be considered ultra-high net worth will change with time as more people become millionaires and billionaires. For now, the threshold is $30 million.\n\nThere are 626,600 ultra-high-net-worth individuals\u2014that is, people with a net worth of over $30 million\u2014according to Knight Frank.\n\nSurveys find different figures, but the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that one in 10 households has a net worth of more than $1.41 million.\n\nUltra-high-net-worth individuals are defined as people with more than $30 million in net worth. This is measured by combining the value of all assets, not just investable or physical assets.\n\nHundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide met this definition. At the end of 2023, 70 new people became ULNWIs every day.According to Knight Frank's projections, the number of ULNWIs will increase by 28.1% from the end of 2023 to 2028, with particularly high growth in India (50%) and the Chinese mainland (47%).\n\nThe number of millionaires in the world continues to grow, so it's safe to say that there will soon be many more UHNWIs. In fact, there are so many that the definition might soon need to be changed.\n\nKnight Frank. \"The 2024 Wealth Report.\"\n\nForbes. \"The World's Real-Time Billionaires.\"\n\nForbes. \"World's Billionaire List | The Richest in 2024.\"\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"The Wealth of Households: 2020,\" Page 2.",
