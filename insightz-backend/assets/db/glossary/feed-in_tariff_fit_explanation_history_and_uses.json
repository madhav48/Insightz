  "definition": "Witthaya Prasongsin / Getty Images\n\nA feed-in tariff (FIT) is a policy designed to encourage the development ofrenewable energy sources. It offers energy producers a guaranteed, above-market price for the electricity they supply to the grid.\u00a0FITs aim is to make renewable energy projects financially attractive by providing long-term contracts and fixed prices, which help reduce the risks associated with these investments.\n\nFeed-in tariffs are used to promote renewable energy sources in the early stages of their development, when production is often noteconomically feasible. Feed-in tariffs usually involve long-term agreements and prices tied to the energy production cost in question. The long-term contracts and guaranteed prices shelter producers from some risks inherent in renewable energy production, encouraging investment and development that otherwise might not occur.\n\nAnyone who produces renewable energyis eligible for a feed-in tariff, but those who take advantage of it are often not commercial energy producers. They can include homeowners, business owners, farmers, and private investors. Generally, FITs\u00a0have three provisions.\n\nOne of the first feed-in tariffs was implemented in the U.S. by the Carter administration in 1978, but they are now used around the world.\n\nThe U.S. was a pioneer in feed-in tariffs. The Carter administration first implemented them in 1978 in response to theenergy crisisof the 1970s, which famously created long lines at gas pumps. Known as the National Energy Act, the FIT was meant to promote energy conservation and the development of renewable energy, such assolar and wind power.\n\nSince then, FITs have become widely used internationally. Japan, Germany, and China have all used them successfully over the past decade or so, and in total dozens of countries have used them to one degree or another to drive the development of renewable energy. It is estimated that about three-fourths of global solar energy is linked to feed-in tariffs.\n\nDespite the successful role feed-in tariffs have played in promoting the development of renewable energy, some countries are turning away from relying on them, instead seeking more market-driven sources of support and more control over the supply of renewable energy produced. That includes Germany and China, two of the more prominent FIT success stories. Nonetheless, FITs still play a vital role in the development of renewable energy resources around the globe.\n\nAs of 2025, three states have a feed-in tariff, according to the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency. Those states are California, New York, and Indiana.In addition, many other states have tax credits or other incentives to encourage small-scale renewable energy production.\n\nA feed-in tariff provides a guaranteed, long-term price for renewable energy that is at or above current market rates. This guaranteed price reduces the risk and uncertainty of new renewable energy installations, encouraging new producers to make initial investments.\n\nTheIRSoffers a 30% credit on new clean energy facilities installed on residential homes between 2022 and 2032. After 2032, the credit falls to 26%. This can apply to solar panels, solar water heaters, wind turbines, fuel cells, and certain other clean energy technologies, and they must be installed in a residence where you live, rather than an investment property. To claim the credit, fileForm 5695with your annual taxes. You may also qualify for state renewable energy credits.\n\nA feed-in tariff is a policy measure intended to incentivize installation and adoption of solar or other clean energy sources. It does this by guaranteeing a high price for renewable energy on the grid, thereby allowing producers to reduce the risk of new installations.\n\nDuke University Nicholas School for the Environment. \"The Case for State Solar Feed-in Tariffs in the USA.\"\n\nDatabase of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency. \"Feed-in Tariffs.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Residential Clean Energy Credit.\"",
