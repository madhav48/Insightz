Organizations use workflow to coordinate tasks, improve organizational efficiency, add responsiveness, and drive profitability. Workflow may be sequential, with each step contingent upon completion of the previous one, or parallel, with multiple steps occurring simultaneously.\n\nThe concept of workflow was important to the study of the rational organization of work processes. These processes optimize manufacturing or informational processes to avoid bottlenecks\u2014known as triage. After WW2, the quality movement developed several workflow improvement theories, which embraced more qualitative notions of business process re-engineering. These philosophies could be applied to carassembly lines, a loan application by a bank, or the production of a newspaper.\n\nSix Sigma and Total quality management (TQM) are two process improvement philosophies that have been embraced by organizations around the world. TQM is a structured approach to overall organizational management, where internal guidelines and process standards reduce errors. The goal of Six Sigma is to reduce defects through quality control.\n\nSix Sigma emphasizes cycle-time improvement while at the same time reducingmanufacturingdefects to a level of no more than 3.4 occurrences per million units or events. In other words, the system is a method to work faster with fewer mistakes.\n\nWorkflow technologies and management systems are being used today in industries as wide-ranging as finance, healthcare, marketing, and higher education. They have been fundamental to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning systems that are having a significant impact on corporate workflows in every industry, thanks to their ability to process and extract value from big data.\n\nBy gathering and sharing data across an organization, and embedding analytics, enterprise data management systems are used to eliminateinformation silosand optimize business processes and automate data processing. This has helped to connect previously disconnected sectors and industries.\n\nFinance is being transformed bybig data, using it for both trading and compliance workflows. Investors are tapping into the flood of real-time data produced by global digitalization and social media, and experimenting with enhanced data analytics and AI to generate investment ideas \u2013 free ofcognitive bias\u2014 and manage risk.\n\nThe need to manage projects across different teams, locations, and time zones has seen a huge rise in the popularity of workflow apps and software. This trend has only accelerated in 2021 as more companies connect with their employeesremotelyduring the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the more popular workflow management software out there includes Easynote, Trello, Monday.com, and Accelo. These platforms make it easy to create tasks and assign them to different people while managing the entire workflow through a dashboard that acts as a central hub. Best of all, many of these platforms provide free access to key features, keeping costs low forstartupsand small businesses.\n\niSixSigma. \"Statistical Six Sigma Definition.\" Accessed April 2, 2021.",
