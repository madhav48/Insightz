  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe least squares criterion is a formula used to measure the accuracy of a straight line in depicting the data that was used to generate it. That is, the formula determines the line of best fit.\n\nThis mathematical formula is used to predict the behavior of the dependent variables. The approach is also called the least squares regression line.\n\nThe least squares criterion is determined by minimizing thesum of squarescreated by a mathematical function. A square is determined by squaring the distance between a data point and the regression line or mean value of the data set.\n\nA least squares\u00a0analysis begins with a set of data points plotted on a graph. Independent variables are plotted on the horizontal x-axis while dependent variables are plotted on the vertical y-axis. The analyst uses the least squares formula to determine the most accurate straight line that will explain the relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable.\n\nAdvances in computing power in addition to new financial engineering techniques have increased the use of least square methods and extended its basic principles.\n\nLeast squares and related statistical methods have become commonplace throughoutfinance, economics, and investing, even if its beneficiaries aren't always aware of their use.\n\nFor example, the robo-advisors now used by many investing platforms employ Monte Carlo simulation techniques to manage portfolios, though this is accomplished behind the scenes and out of the sight of the account holders who use them.\n\nOther applications include time-series analysis of return distributions, economic forecasting and policy strategy, and advanced option modeling.\n\nInstead of trying to solve an equation exactly, mathematicians use theleast squares methodto arrive at a close approximation. This is referred to as a maximum-likelihood estimate.\n\nThe least squares approach limits the distance between a function and the data points that the function explains. It is used in regression analysis, often innonlinear regressionmodeling in which a curve is fit into a set of data.\n\nMathematicians use the least squares method to arrive at a maximum-likelihood estimate.\n\nThe least squares approach is a popular method for determining regression equations, and it tells you about the relationship between response variables and predictor variables.\n\nModeling methods that are often used when fitting a function to a curve include the straight-line method, thepolynomial method, the logarithmic method, and the Gaussian method.\n\nLinear or ordinary least squares is the simplest and most commonly used linear regression estimator for analyzing observational and experimental data. It finds a straight line of best fit through a set of given data points.",
