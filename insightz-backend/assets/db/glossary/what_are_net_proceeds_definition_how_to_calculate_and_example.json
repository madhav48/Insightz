  "definition": "Net proceeds are\u00a0the amount the seller receives following the sale of anassetafter all costs and expenses are deducted from the gross proceeds. Depending on the asset sold, the\u00a0costs may account for a small percentage of the gross proceeds or a substantial percentage of the gross proceeds.Capital gains taxesare paid on the net proceeds of a sale\u00a0rather than the gross proceeds.\n\nNet proceeds are the final amount a seller receives from the sale of an asset after all costs have been taken into consideration. Depending on the asset, the cost can include:\n\nIt's important to be aware of all of the costs that go into a sale of an asset as it will help determine the appropriate selling price.\n\nOne area that commonly impacts net proceeds from a sale is the sale of a house. When calculating net proceeds on a home sale, the outstanding mortgage\u00a0or other liens on the property, commission for the seller\u2019s agent and the buyer\u2019s agent, excise tax, and other closing costs owed by the seller, are subtracted from the gross sale price of the home. If negative net proceeds result, the seller must provide cash at the time of closing to pay off the mortgage\u00a0or receive the bank\u2019s approval for ashort sale.\n\nIncome from selling stocks,mutual funds, property, or other assets is reported on a personal or corporate tax return. Taxes are paid on the asset\u2019s capital gains rather than on its selling price.\n\nWhen calculating capital gains or losses, the amount paid to acquire the asset, called its basis, must be known. For example, consider an investor who purchases $6,000 in stock and pays a $24 commission. The stock\u2019s basis is $6,024. When an asset is inherited, its basis is thefair market valueon the date of the person\u2019s death\u00a0regardless of the amount paid for the asset.\n\nNet proceeds must be calculated as well. For example, the same investor sells the stock for $8,000 and pays a $32 commission. The net proceeds are $7,968. The basis is subtracted from the asset\u2019s net proceeds. Because $7,968 - $6,024 = $1,944, the capital gain is $1,944.\n\nAs mentioned, selling a home is an area where costs are varied that determine the net proceeds of the sale. Let's say Jim is selling his house for $100,000. With the sale comes many costs that first need to be summed to arrive at total costs.\n\nThe costs associated with the sale of the house are:\n\nTo arrive at the net proceeds we would subtract the total costs from the sales cost of the house.\n\nNet Proceeds = $100,000 - $12,000 = $88,000",
