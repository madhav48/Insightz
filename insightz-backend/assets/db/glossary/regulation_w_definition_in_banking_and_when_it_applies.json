  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nRegulation W is a U.S.Federal Reserve System (FRS)regulation that limits certain transactions between depository institutions, such as banks and theiraffiliates. In particular, it sets quantitative limits on covered transactions and requirescollateralfor certain transactions.\n\nThe regulation applies to banks that are members of the Fed, insured state non-member banks, andinsured savings associations. Regulation W was introduced to consolidate several decades of interpretations and rulemaking under Sections 23A and 23B of theFederal Reserve Act.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nRegulation W, the rule that implements sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, was published on Dec. 12, 2002, and came into effect on April 1, 2003.\n\nSections 23A and 23B, Regulation W limits the risks to a bank from transactions between the bank and its affiliates. They also limit the ability of a depository institution to transfer to its affiliates the subsidy arising from the institution's access to the federal safety net, which offers benefits such as lower-cost insured deposits and the discount window. These objectives are accomplished by imposing quantitative and qualitative limits on the ability of a bank to extend credit to an affiliate or engage in certain other transactions with it.\n\nThe Fed noted in January 2003 that Regulation W included 70 years' worth of interpretive guidance concerning statutory requirements \"that are fairly brief but extremely complex in application.\" Regulation W is comprehensive in its scope, resolving as many as nine significant issues, including derivative transactions, intraday credit, and financial subsidiaries.\n\nBecause most large U.S. banks exist within a diversified holding company structure, the possibility that bank funds may finance somewhat risky purposes exists. Regulation W seeks to limit this risk and is conceptually straightforward, although implementation is not easy. Compliance with Regulation W is a particular challenge for some banks that are dealing with issues such as rapid growth incapital marketactivities or integration of previous acquisitions.\n\nComplying with Regulation W was complex, even before the regulatory reforms that were instituted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. TheDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\u2014which has been criticized by some as being overly burdensome\u2014further tightened Regulation W\u2019s requirements.\n\nBecause exemptions to Regulation W rules widely provided emergency liquidity to affiliates during the financial crisis, the Fed's ability to grant exemptions on its sole authority was curbed under the new rules. For example, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)now has 60 days to determine whether an exemption is justified or whether it might pose an unacceptable risk to its deposit insurance fund and raise any objections.\n\nModifications to Regulation W have also expanded the concept of what an \u201caffiliate\u201d is and what constitutes a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d under the law.Banking regulatorsnow expect greater transparency from banks in complying with Regulation W.\n\nRegulation W aims to protect banks and federal deposit insurance funds from undue financial risk.\n\nGiven that Regulation W applies to covered transactions between a bank and its affiliate, two basic questions need to be answered in determining whether a transaction is subject to this regulation:\n\nRegulation W defines a bank's affiliates quite broadly including any company that the bank directly or indirectly controls or that is sponsored and advised by a bank, as well as subsidiaries of the bank.\n\nCovered transactions under Regulation W cover a wide spectrum of transactions, including:\n\nUnder Regulation W, transactions with any affiliate must total no more than 10% of a financial institution's capital, and transactions with all affiliates combined must total no more than 20% of an institution's capital.\n\nBanks are also prohibited from purchasing low-quality assets from their affiliates, such as bonds with principal and interest payments that are more than 30 dayspast due. Meanwhile, any extension of credit must be secured by collateral with coverage that ranges between 100% and 130% of the total transaction amount.\n\nAs an example, consider a transaction where the hypothetical bank BigBanc intends to purchase a loan portfolio from its subsidiary SmallBanc. In order to comply with Regulation W, BigBanc must ensure that the transaction with SmallBanc does not exceed more than 10% of its capital and that the loan portfolio is not considered a low-quality asset. The transaction must also take place under market terms and conditions.\n\nThe Fed monitors banks' exposures to their affiliates through the FR Y-8 report that collects information on transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates.The report has to be submitted by banks quarterly, on the last calendar day of each quarter.\n\nFinancial institutions that are found to be in violation of Regulation W can be hit with substantial civil penalties. The amount of the fine is determined by several factors, including whether the violation was caused with intent, undertaken with reckless disregard for the institution's financial safety and soundness, or resulted in any type of gain by the perpetrator.\n\nRegulation W establishes the rulemaking authority granted to the Federal Reserve pursuant to sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. It regulates covered transactions, which include the extension of credit to an affiliate, asset purchases from an affiliate, acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for credit, and other specifically defined transactions.\n\nNo transaction with a single affiliate can exceed 10% of an institution's capital.\n\nAll affiliate transactions may not exceed 20% of the institution's held capital.\n\nYes, Regulation W allows the Federal Reserve Bank to permit exemptions, but certain exemptions also require approval from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).\n\nRegulation W\u2014added to the Federal Reserve Bank\u2019s \u201calphabet regulations\u201d because it is the 23rd letter of the alphabet and the 23rd regulation\u2014governs covered transactions between a bank and its affiliates. This is outlined in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.\n\nSection 23A defines the kinds of companies that are bank affiliates. It stipulates the kinds of transactions covered by this statute. It also sets the quantifiable limitations on a bank\u2019s covered transactions with any single affiliate; also with all collective affiliates. Finally, it outlines collateral requirements for specific bank transactions with affiliates.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations. \"Part 223-Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates (Regulation W).\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Adoption of Regulation W Implementing Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Legal Interpretations-Frequently Asked Questions About Regulation W.\"\n\nFederal Registrar. \"Transactions Between Member Banks and Their Affiliates.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Report Forms-FR Y-8.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Federal Reserve Act: Section 29.
