  "term": "Tax Haven: Definition, Examples, Advantages, and Legality",
  "definition": "A tax haven is a country that offers foreign businesses and individuals minimal or no tax liability for their bank deposits. They have tax advantages for corporations and for the very wealthy, and potential for misuse in illegal tax evasion schemes.\n\nBroadly speaking, tax havens are jurisdictions that have low taxes and low residency requirements. They also have strong financial privacy laws.\n\nThe Tax Justice Network maintains a Corporate Tax Haven Index that tracks the jurisdictions that it says are \"most complicit\" in helping multinational corporations avoid taxes. As of October 2024, the worst offenders were the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Bermuda.\n\nTax havens may be found in another country or in a separate jurisdiction.\n\nSome U.S. states have no income tax. That simple fact makes them attractive tocorporations looking to pay less overall in taxes, although it doesn't help them avoid federal taxes.\n\nFor example, in the United States, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming require no state income tax.\n\nDelaware is the state of choice for corporate incorporation. It does not impose a corporate tax on corporations that incorporate in Delaware but do business elsewhere.\n\nFrom the viewpoint of an American, \"offshore\" is anywhere outside the U.S.\n\nOffshore tax havens benefit from the capital their countries draw into their economies. The funds flow in from individuals and businesses with accounts at banks and other financial institutions.\n\nIndividuals and corporations benefit from low or no taxes charged on income in foreign countries where loopholes, credits, or other special tax considerations may be allowed.\n\nCharacteristics of tax haven countries generally include no or low taxes, minimal reporting of information, lack of transparency obligations, lack of local presence requirements, and marketing of tax haven vehicles.\n\nWorldwide, there is not a comprehensively-defined standard for the classification of a tax haven country. However, several regulatory bodies monitor tax haven countries, including theOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED)and the U.S.Government Accountability Office (GAO).\n\nTheTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TJCA), which passed in December 2017, set the effective corporate tax rate at 21%.It also added provisions intended to discourage foreign investments.\n\nSystematically, the TCJA is known for being more territorial in nature than previous international tax laws. The international tax system under the TCJA exempts foreign profits from domestic taxation but has certain provisions for high-return foreign profits.\n\nSome companies that have historically been known for offshore tax haven holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco, and Oracle. Overall, tax havens may also offer advantages in the area ofcredit, since it may be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally. This type of lending, which can potentially fund acquisitions and other corporate activities, is also subject to reporting within the guidelines of U.S. tax law,generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and guidelines under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\n\nThe U.S. has special rules in place for the reporting of foreign income by U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens. These rules are generally governed under theForeign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).\n\nFATCA requires the filing of a Schedule B and/or Form 8938, which provides disclosure of foreign account holdings when investments exceed $50,000. Separately, foreign account holders may also be required to file Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.\n\nIn general, there can potentially be exemptions and foreign tax credits for investment in all types of overseas vehicles, but it is important to consult a tax advisor to ensure proper reporting.\n\nTax havens create opportunities for illegal activities that go well beyond tax evasion. They are popular stops in the elaborate process of money laundering, which involves transferring illegally obtained cash through a series of shell companies until it can't be traced.\n\nAs such, there is some regulatory oversight of tax havens.\n\nTo maximize tax receipts, many foreign governments maintain relatively constant pressure on tax havens to release information regarding offshore investment accounts. However, regulatory oversight may not always be a top national priority.\n\nWorldwide, some programs are in place to increase the enforcement of offshore investment reporting. The Automatic Exchange of Financial Information is one example, overseen by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).\n\nThe program requires participating countries to automatically transmit tax-related banking information of non-citizen depositors to the countries in which they are citizens.\n\nSometimes it takes a crisis to force change. For example, Cyprus\u2019s financial sector,built on the country\u2019s tax haven status, collapsed in 2013. The European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund predicated an $11.8 billion bailout on the country's agreement to comply with more robust tax participation.\n\nTax havens include the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Bermuda, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, Jersey, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2022, U.S. companies shifted a collective $800 billion in profits to overseas jurisdictions, $369 billion of that to countries considered tax havens. Worldwide, multinational corporations shifted nearly a trillion dollars of profits to tax havens.\n\nCorporations and wealthy individuals benefit primarily from low or no taxes on their income in foreign countries where loopholes, credits, or other special tax considerations may be lawful.\n\nIt may also be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally.\n\nIn addition, some tax havens have strong privacy protections and share limited or no financial information with foreign tax authorities.\n\nTax havens benefit when their financial institutionsbring in a vast amount of money. That money is then invested for profit.\n\nPlus, even the very low fees charged for offshore accounts add up. According to a study by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. households hold about $4 trillion in overseas accounts, about half of it in countries normally considered tax havens.\n\nTax havens are jurisdictions that attract foreign investors with comparatively low tax burdens or bank reporting requirements. These countries and territories have become attractive destinations for foreign capital. While they are not inherently illegal, a person who banks or invests in a tax haven may be violating the laws of their home country.\n\nTax Foundation. \"The Good and Bad about Tax Havens.\"\n\nTax Justice Network. \"Corporate Tax Haven Index.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets for 2023.\"\n\nDelaware Division of Revenue. \"Doing Business in Delaware.\"\n\nTax Policy Center. \"How Did the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Change Business Taxes?\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"A Hybrid Approach: The Treatment of Foreign Profits under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\"\n\nTax Policy Center. \"What is the TCJA Repatriation Tax and How Does it Work?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"FATCA Information for Individuals.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Comparison of Form 8938 and FBAR Requirements.\"\n\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"Automatic Exchange of Information.\"\n\nEuropean Tax Observatory. \"Global Tax Evasion Report 2024,\" Page 47.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"The Offshore World According to FATCA: New Evidence on the Foreign Wealth of US Households,\" Page 1.",
