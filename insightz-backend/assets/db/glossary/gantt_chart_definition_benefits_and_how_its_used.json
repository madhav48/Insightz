  "definition": "A Gantt chart is a commonly used graphical depiction of a project schedule. It\u2019s a type of bar chart showing the start and finish dates of a project\u2019s elements, such as resources, planning, and dependencies.\n\nHenry Gantt (1861\u20131919), an American mechanical engineer, designed the Gantt chart.\n\nThe Gantt chart is the most widely used chart inproject management. These charts are useful in planning a project and defining the sequence of tasks that require completion. In most instances, the chart is displayed\u00a0as a horizontal bar chart.\n\nHorizontal bars of different lengths represent the project timeline, which can include\u00a0task sequences, duration, and the start and end dates for each task. The horizontal bar also shows how much of a task requires completion.\n\nThe length of the bar is proportional to the time necessary for a task\u2019s completion. The project tasks are represented on the vertical axis.\n\nA Gantt chart helps in scheduling, managing, and monitoring specific tasks and resources in a project. The chart shows the project timeline, which includes scheduled and completed work over a period of time. The Gantt chart aidsproject managersin communicating project status and completion rate of specific tasks within a project, and helps ensure the project remains on track. By convention, it is a standard tool that makes communication unified among the engineering and project management communities.\n\nThe Gantt chart identifies tasks that may be executed in parallel and those that can\u2019t be started or finished until others are complete. It can help detect\u00a0potential bottlenecks and identify tasks that may have been excluded from theproject timeline.\n\nThe chart depicts things like task slack time or additional time for completion of a task that shouldn\u2019t delay the project; noncritical activities that may be delayed; and critical activities that must be executed on time.\n\nGantt charts can be used in managing\u00a0projects of all sizes and types. These may include buildinginfrastructureslike dams, bridges, and highways. They may also include software development and other technologies. Project management tools, such as Microsoft Visio, Project, SharePoint, andExcel, or specialized software, such as Gantto or Matchware, can help\u00a0in designing Gantt charts.\n\nCompany A is taking on a project to install new software on the servers of a largeinvestment bank. Company A decides to create a Gantt chart to help manage the project and its different components.\n\nThe project\u2019s tasks that require completion include conducting research, selecting a software product, testing the software, and installing it. These tasks appear as vertical lines\u00a0on the Gantt chart.\u00a0A milestone of the project is selecting the software.\n\nThe project\u2019s duration is 40 days, as agreed upon between Company A and the investment bank. Each task takes 10 days to complete, and each task is dependent on the previous task. A critical activity is testing the software in the development and test environments.\n\nThe task start and end dates, duration, and milestones appear as horizontal bars on the Gantt chart. The percentage of work completed for each task is also displayed\u00a0on the horizontal bars. Using the Gantt chart will help Company A map out the tasks along a timeline to reach full completion in 40 days.\n\nGantt charts help visualize various tasks and projects that occur simultaneously within an organization, and how far along they have progressed. They are used by management to plan and schedule such projects so that resources can be allocated in an optimal way and that projects that are prioritized can finish before less important ones begin.\n\nHenry Gantt was a social scientist and management consultant who also held a degree in mechanical engineering. He worked in the field of scientific management, developing methods to streamline and increase the productivity of corporations and their workforce. He created the Gantt chart in the 1910s to help supervisors understand the progress of their labor force and to ensure tasks were on schedule.\n\nA Gantt chart can vary in complexity and depth, but will always have three key components: activities or tasks that are to be done, running along the y axis; milestones or progress stages indicated along the x axis (either on the top or bottom of the chart); and progress bars, denoted as horizontal bars, denoting how far along each task is at any given point.\n\nA Gantt chart is a visual description of a project\u2019s timeline. The chart shows the start and end dates of a project\u2019s components, such as resources and planning. If you are involved in a project, it is recommended to use a Gantt chart to help organize the various tasks within the project.",
