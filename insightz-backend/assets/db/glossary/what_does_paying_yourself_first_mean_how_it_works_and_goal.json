  "term": "What Does Paying Yourself First Mean? How It Works and Goal",
  "definition": "\"Pay yourself first\" is an investor mentality and phrase popular inpersonal financeandretirement planningthat encourages you to save money before you spend it. If you direct some of your paycheck to a savings or investment account\u2014that is, pay yourself\u2014before you do anything else with that money, your savings will grow.\n\nHowever, this guidance isn't realistic for everyone.\n\nMany personal finance professionals and retirement planners tout the\"pay yourself first\" methodas an effective way to ensure you contribute to savings month after month. Regular savings contributions can go a long way toward building a long-term nest egg.\n\nIf you are using the \"pay yourself first\" method of personal finance, you may opt to put your money in a range of savings vehicles, depending on your financial objectives. The phrase can refer to earmarking a certain percentage of your paycheck to be contributed to your retirement accounts, such as a401(k)or anindividual retirement account (IRA). Alternatively, you may put the funds in a cash savings account.\n\n\"Paying yourself first\" simply involves building up a retirement account, creating anemergency fund, or saving for other long-term goals, such asbuying a home.\n\nIf you can manage it, paying yourself first will likely reduce your stress, as you'll have something saved for retirement and a way to pay for emergencies in cash, from your car breaking down to unexpected medical expenses.\n\nIn 2023, over a third (37%) of Americans could not cover a $400 emergency in cash or its equivalent, a Federal Reserve report found. This is the same as it was in 2022, but a bit higher than it was in 2021 (32%). In 2023, a similar percentage of people believed their retirement savings were on track (34%), which was about the same in 2022 (31%) but lower than it was in 2021 (40%).\n\nAccording to Bankrate's Annual Emergency Savings Report, over 27% of respondents had no emergency savings at all, and about the same percentage (29%) had some savings, but less than 3 months' worth of living expenses. 16% had 3 to 5 months' worth of living expenses, and 28% had 6 months' worth of living expenses or more. The breakdown by age reveals that Baby Boomers had far more emergency savings than other generations: almost half (46%) of Baby Boomers had 6 months' worth of living expenses or more, compared to 25% of Gen X, 20% of Millennials, and 11% of Gen Z.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board found that in surveys conducted from 2016-2022, the average retirement savings among everyone who responded (35 years old to 64 years old) was about $331,000.\n\nThe number of families who participated in retirement plans increased to the highest level since 2010.\n\nFor those with incomes in the bottom half, the average savings was about $55,000. For those with mid-to-high incomes, the average savings was about $227,000. For those in the top 10%, the average savings was about $913,000.\n\nSome people may avoid contributing totax-advantagedretirement savings plans because they worry about having no money for emergencies. It's important to know, however, that the contributions you set aside for retirement in aRoth IRAare, in fact,accessible if needed. Though financial planners caution that this should only be done in emergencies\u2014because withdrawals take money away from your future\u2014the fact is that you can withdraw however much you contributed to the account because you already paid taxes on those funds. These withdrawals are tax and penalty-free.\n\nThe rules for earnings are different, however. The earnings in the account (the money your contributions made) are not accessible unless you have had the account for over five years. And if you're younger than age 59 \u00bd, it's considered an early withdrawal, and you'll pay a 10% tax penalty to theInternal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThere is an exception to this: you can withdraw earnings tax and penalty-free if you make what's called a qualified withdrawal. For it to be a qualified withdrawal, you must have had the account for over five years, and the withdrawal must either be due to a disability, for a first-time home purchase (or building / rebuilding a first home), up to $10,000, or be for a beneficiary after your death.\n\nAnd if you're willing to pay taxes on the earnings (though you wouldn't if you wait until you're 59 \u00bd, as long as you've had the account for five years), there are several exceptions to the 10% penalty, including withdrawals for higher education expenses or for the birth of a child.\n\n\"Pay yourself first\" means when you get paid, you should try to put money away in your own savings before you spend money on anything else, whether it's your regular monthly living expenses or discretionary purchases.\n\nIf you can do this, you'll be able to build up an account that will secure your future,\u00a0and create a cushion for financial emergencies.\n\nHowever, for many people, this adage isn't realistic. You might simply not earn enough money to pay yourself first\u2014that is, to save before covering your bills. If that's the case, start small. Even really small. Save whenever and wherever you can. Making it a habit is a good place to start.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023.\"\n\nBankrate. \"Bankrate\u2019s 2024 Annual Emergency Savings Report.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2019 to 2022.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics: Exceptions to Tax on Early Distributions.\"",
