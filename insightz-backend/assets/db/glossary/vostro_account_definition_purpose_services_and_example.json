  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA vostro account is an account acorrespondent bankholds on behalf of another bank. These accounts are an essential aspect of correspondent banking in which the bank holding the funds acts as custodian for or manages the account of a foreign counterpart. For example, if a Spanishlife insurancecompany approaches a U.S. bank to manage funds on the Spanish life insurer's behalf, the account is deemed by the holding bank as a vostro account of the insurance company.\n\nA vostro account is established to enable a foreign correspondent bank to act as an agent or provide services as an intermediary for a domestic bank. These services include executingwire transfers, withdrawals, and deposits for customers in countries where the domestic bank does not have a physical presence.\n\nThe foreign correspondent bank might also perform treasury services, executeforeign exchange transactions, and expedite international trade on behalf of the domestic bank. The correspondent bank charges the domestic bank for the services associated with the vostro account.\n\nThe termvostro,translated from Latin, means \"your,\" as in your account. From the foreign correspondent bank\u2019s point of view, the funds held on behalf of other banks are referred to as vostro accounts and are denominated in the local currency.\n\nFrom the perspective of domestic banks, the funds deposited at correspondent banks are referred to asnostro accounts.Nostro,translated from Latin, means \"our,\" as in our accounts. Nostro accounts are denominated in the foreign currency of the correspondent bank.\n\nIn the context of banking and finance, a Vostro account is the account held by the respondent bank on behalf of the correspondent bank. Meanwhile, a Nostro account is the account held by the correspondent bank at the respondent bank. These two terms reflect the perspective of each bank in the correspondent banking relationship.\n\nSmall domestic banks that lack financial and human resources sometimes use the services of larger correspondent banks in foreign countries as an economic way to serve clients with global banking needs.\n\nThere are several situations where vostro accounts are typically used. The most common situations include but are not limited to:\n\nFor most banks, the cost of building physical branches in every country their customers might need banking services is prohibitive. As a solution, domestic banks can initiate agency relationship agreements with correspondent banks to transact business for customers who are traveling, living abroad, or who own companies that do business abroad. As an agent of the domestic bank, the correspondent bank is authorized to perform certain agreed-upon financial transactions, acting as afiduciaryin the relationship.\n\nIn this relationship, both banks perform due diligence on each other to assess their credibility, financial stability, compliance with regulations, and suitability for the intended agency relationship. The banks also negotiate terms of the agency relationship agreement, document it in a formal agreement, ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirements, and implement the necessary operational and technical processes to facilitate transactions and reporting related to the vostro account.\n\nWhen funds are wired between a domestic and a foreign bank that do not have a direct relationship, a correspondent bank acts as thefinancial intermediaryin the transaction. To facilitate the wire, the originator of the transfer sends the amount of the wire plus applicable fees to the vostro account held on its behalf by the correspondent bank. The correspondent bank deducts the fees and the amount of the wire from the vostro account and executes a domestic wire to the receiving bank.\n\nIn this type of relationship, the correspondent bank provides regular reports to the respondent bank. This includes detailing the transactions, balances, and other relevant information related to the vostro account. This helps the respondent bank monitor its financial activities in the foreign market and maintain oversight of its funds.\n\nAdditionally, this vostro account arrangement helps mitigate risks associated with cross-border transactions. Both banks must adhere to regulatory requirements, such asanti-money launderingand consumer regulations, ensuring compliance and enhancing the integrity of the financial system.\n\nWith a vostro account relationship in place, the customer of a domestic bank can walk into the office of a correspondent bank to withdraw or deposit funds. For example, to process a customer\u2019s withdrawal of funds at a correspondent bank, the domestic bank deducts the withdrawal amount plus any fees from the customer\u2019s account and executes a transfer to the vostro account held by the correspondent bank. The funds are converted to the local currency, deducted from the vostro account, and paid to the domestic bank\u2019s customer,minus the applicable fees.\n\nVostro accounts allow banks to expand their global reach, offer services in foreign currencies, reduce transaction costs, mitigate currency risks, and provide convenient access to local banking infrastructure and services in foreign markets.\n\nVostro accounts facilitate a range of transactions including fund transfers, foreign currency exchanges, trade settlements, payment processing, and collection of local currency funds on behalf of the respondent bank's customers.\n\nBanks holding vostro accounts are required to maintain detailed records of transactions, monitor compliance with regulatory obligations, and provide regular reporting to the local regulatory authorities to ensure transparency and prevent money laundering or illegal activities.\n\nVostro account balances are generally not insured by deposit insurance schemes since they represent liabilities of the respondent bank held on behalf of the correspondent bank. However, deposit insurance coverage may vary by jurisdiction, so it's important to understand the applicable regulations and safeguards in your specific country.\n\nA Vostro account is a bank account held by one bank on behalf of another bank, typically in a foreign currency. It allows respondent banks to provide services to their customers in foreign markets, leveraging the local banking infrastructure of the respondent bank. Vostro accounts facilitate international trade, correspondent banking relationships, foreign currency transactions, and access to local banking services.",
