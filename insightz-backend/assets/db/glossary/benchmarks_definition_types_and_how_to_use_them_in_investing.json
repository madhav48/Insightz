  "definition": "A benchmark is a standard that is used to measure the change in an asset's value or another metric over time. In investing, benchmarks are used as a reference point for the performance of securities,\u00a0mutual funds,\u00a0exchange-traded funds, portfolios, or other financial instruments.\n\nGenerally, broad market and market-segment stock and bond indexes are used for this purpose\u2014even cryptocurrencies have benchmarks, hallmarking the importance of having something to compare an asset's performance to.\n\nIf there is an investment instrument, there is a benchmark to compare it to\u2014learn more about benchmarks andhow you can use them to check your portfolio's performance.\n\nMarket benchmarks are indexes\u2014amarket proxy\u2014created to include multiple securities, assets, or other instruments to represent the performance of a stock, fund, or any other investment of the same type and composition.\n\nBenchmark indexes have been created across all types of asset classes. For example, theS&P 500and Dow Jones Industrial Average are two of the most popular large-capitalization stock benchmarks in the equities market.\n\nThe S&P 500 was created by Standard & Poor's. It lists 500 companies\u2014there are actually 505 stocks on the index\u2014based on specific metrics and valuation techniques that reflect the best-performing stocks on the stock market (according to the professionals at S&P).\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average comprises 30 U.S. blue-chip stocks\u2014the stocks of well-recognized, established, and financially sound companies.\n\nThe S&P 500, of course, has many more stocks listed on it than the Dow does, but there are many similar stocks:\n\nBoth of these indexes are used by many to gauge the performance of the stock market as a whole, even though they only represent a fraction of the stocks listed on public exchanges.\n\nMutual fund investors may use\u00a0Refinitiv Lipper indexes, which use the 30 largest mutual funds in a specific category, while international investors may use MSCI Indexes.The Wilshire 5000 is also a popular benchmark; it represents all of the publicly traded stocks in the U.S.\n\nFixed income indexes measure the performance of fixed income assets like bonds and treasuries, which investors use for generating income or as a way to preserve capital during falling market conditions.\n\nSome examples of top fixed income benchmarks include the Bloomberg Aggregate Bond Index (known as the Agg), the Bloomberg Capital U.S. Corporate High Yield Bond Index, and the Bloomberg Capital U.S. Treasury Bond Index.\n\nCommodity indexes measure the performance of a basket of commodities. For example, the Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM) consists of 23 exchange-traded physical commodities futures. The index measures 21 commodities across five different sectors and acts as an indicator of the performance of the commodities market. The five sectors are:\n\nIn addition to traditional benchmarks representing broad market characteristics such as large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, growth, and value, you'll also find indexes based on fundamental characteristics, sectors, dividends, market trends, investing themes, and much more.\n\nThematic indexes are lists of stocks that meet specific criteria for a theme, such as environmental, social, and governance (ESG) or sustainability.\n\nThe following are examples of the most popular benchmarks used in investing.\n\nWhenevaluating your investment portfolio's performance, it's important to compare it against a benchmark representing the industry, sector, and market segment to which it belongs. However, if your portfolio is diversified, you may not be able to compare the total portfolio against one index\u2014you may need to evaluate it in sections based on how you've allocated your investments.\n\nMost retail investors don't build their portfolios by choosing individual stocks. However, it is possible to do so\u2014but in many cases, it is simply too expensive and time-consuming to evaluate stocks and purchase the ones that meet your investing criteria. So, many choose mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that mirror the performance of specific indexes.\n\nIf you have a fund\u2014or more than one\u2014in your portfolio, you can compare the information fund managers already provide to see how your funds are doing compared to the indexes they mirror.\n\nFor example, the Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK) is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Mega Cap Growth Index. If you had purchased shares of MGK and wanted to evaluate its performance, you'd first find the fund's page on Vanguard's website and locate the \"Performance and Fees\" tab and ensure \"Summary\" is underlined by clicking on it. You'll see the following information:\n\nYou can see the fund's changes in market price from its inception to the last month's performance and compare it to its benchmark. Then, find the historical volatility and see how the fund's return and risk compares to that of its benchmark:\n\nR-squared measures how closely the fund has tracked its benchmark\u2014in MGK's case, it has very closely matched the returns of its benchmark (a value of 1.0 indicate tracking, while less than 1.0 indicates less tracking).\n\nBeta is a measure of the fund's risk compared to that of the benchmark\u2014again, MGK has matched its benchmark's risk level (again, 1.0 indicates it has tracked, while less or more than 1.0 indicates less or more tracking, respectively).\n\nMGK has historically matched the return and risk of the benchmark index it was designed to track, give or take a few percentage points. However, when compared to the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index, MGK has returned less and has slightly more risk.\n\nThe best stock benchmark is an index that matches your portfolio or holdings the closest.\n\nIt is very commonly used, but many more can be used based on how the benchmark is designed. Some widely used benchmarks in the stock market are the Wilson 5000, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Russel 2000.\n\nDifferent indexes use different methods to calculate their performance. For example, the S&P 500 uses a free-float marketcapitalization method.\n\nMarket benchmarks are important because they allow investors to compare their holdings' performance against reliable metrics. Additionally, benchmarks indicate the health of a market\u2014you can also see how a particular class is performing or view the equities market performance as a whole. Market benchmarks constantly evolve, with new ones occasionally appearing based on changing investing strategies and investor sentiments.\n\nThe one limitation benchmarks have is that they are indicators of past performance\u2014there is no way of knowing how the investments that comprise an index will perform. You can only view the results of your investment decisions\u2014which is a good thing because you can use the information to make adjustments or readdress your strategy.\n\nMSCI. \"MSCI Equity Indexes August 2022 Index Review.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"Bloomberg Fixed Income Indices.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"Bloomberg Commodity Index (BCOM),\" Page 1.\n\nS&P Global. \"Investment Themes | ESG.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"Bloomberg ESG & Climate Indices.\"\n\nVanguard. \"Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK).\"",
