  "term": "Regressive Tax: Definition and Types of Taxes That Are Regressive",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA regressive tax is one in which low-income owners pay a larger percentage of income than middle- and high-income earners. The tax burden decreases with regressive taxes as income rises. This is in contrast to a progressive tax that takes a larger percentage from high-income earners.\n\nCommon forms of regressive tax include sales tax, excise tax, and payroll tax.\n\nTaxesare contributions made by individuals and corporations to governments. They come in many forms and are levied at different levels including federal, state/provincial, regional, and local. Types of taxes vary but they tend to fall into one of three distinct categories: progressive orability to pay taxation, proportional taxes, and regressive taxes.\n\nRegressive taxes affect people with low incomes more severely than those with higher incomes because they're applied uniformly to all situations regardless of thetaxpayer.It may be fair in some instances to tax everyone at the same rate but it's seen as unjust in other cases. Most income tax systems employ a progressive schedule that taxes high-income earners at a higher percentage rate than low-income earners. Other types of taxes are uniformly applied.\n\nThe United States has a progressiveincome taxsystem. Earners with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of taxes on their top dollars compared to those with lower incomes.Taxpayers do pay certain levies that are considered to be\u00a0regressive taxes, however. Some of these include state sales taxes, user fees, and property taxes to some degree.\n\nA regressive tax system is more common in less developed countries where there may be a greater number of people in the same income bracket, reducing the negative impact of the regressive tax.\n\nTaxes come in various shapes and sizes. These are some of the most common types of regressive taxes that taxpayers must pay.\n\nGovernments applysales taxuniformly to all consumers based on what they buy. The tax may be uniform such as 7% on all purchases but lower-income consumers are more affected by that 7%. Let's say two individuals each purchase $100 of clothing per week. Each pays $7 in tax on their retail purchase.\n\nThe tax is the same rate in both cases but the person with the lower income pays a higher percentage of their income, making the tax regressive.\n\nExcise taxesare levied on specific goods such as tobacco, alcohol, gasoline, and luxury items. They're often added to the price of the goods and they're paid by the consumer at the point of sale.\n\nAn excise tax can be regressive if it's the same for everyone regardless of income. This is especially true for products consumed by low-income individuals because these earners are likely to spend a larger proportion of their income on taxed goods than high-income earners. An excise tax on cheap beer is regressive considering how consumer demands may play a factor.\n\nExcise taxes can also be designed to be progressive. The tax would have a greater impact on high-income earners who are more likely to purchaseluxury itemsif the tax rate on luxury items is higher than the tax rate on necessities like food or clothing. The tax is progressive in this case because the low-income individual wouldn't be likely to ever purchase the luxury good.\n\nTariffscan be considered regressive taxes when they're applied uniformly on all imported goods regardless of their price or the income of the people who buy them.\n\nLower-income individuals tend to spend a larger proportion of their income on imported goods than households with higher incomes. This may also depend on consumer preferences, however, and may be progressive for tariffs placed on more luxurious goods.\n\nUser feeslevied by the government are another form of regressive tax. These fees include admission to government-funded museums and state parks, costs for driver's licenses and identification cards, and toll fees for roads and bridges.\n\nIf two families travel to the Grand Canyon National Park and pay a $30 admission fee, the family with the higher income pays a lower percentage of its income to access the park, while the family with the lower income pays a higher percentage. The fee is the same amount but it constitutes a more significant burden on the family with the lower income, again making it a regressive tax.\n\nProperty taxesare fundamentally regressive. Two individuals would pay the same amount of property tax regardless of their incomes if they owned properties with the same values.\n\nThey're not purely regressive in practice, however, because they're based on the value of theproperty.It's generally thought that lower-income earners live in less expensive homes, partially indexing property taxes to income.\n\nThe phraseflat taxrefers to a taxation system in which the government taxes all income at the same percentage regardless of earnings. There are no special deductions or credits under a flat tax. Each individual pays a set percentage that's levied on all income so everyone effectively pays the same rate.\n\nThe tax burden on those with low incomes is often heavy compared to those with higher incomes, even at the same rate. The proportion of income that's taxed is higher for low-income earners. Flat taxes may be considered regressive as a result.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare taxes can be considered regressive because they're typically levied as a flat tax rate on wages and salaries up to a certain limit. Everyone pays the same percentage of their earnings in payroll taxes regardless of their income level.\n\nSocial Securitytaxes are levied at a flat rate of 6.2% on wages and salaries up to $168,600 in 2024.Someone who earns $50,000 a year pays the same percentage of their income in payroll taxes as someone who earns $100,000 a year.\n\nTaxes that are imposed and collected on products that are deemed to be harmful to society are referred to assin taxes. They're added to the prices of goods like alcohol and tobacco to dissuade people from purchasing and using them. TheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)considers these taxes to be regressive because they're more burdensome on low-income earners rather than their high-income counterparts.\n\nCorporate taxes are theoretically regressive because companies may be able to reduce their tax liability down to $0. Some of the highest-earning companies would be able to avoid all federal taxes if this is the case.\n\nRegressive, progressive, and proportional taxes are used by governments to generaterevenue. Each type of tax is different in how it's calculated and the people it affects, primarily depending on different income levels.\n\nA regressive tax system is one in which the rate decreases as the taxpayer's income increases. Aprogressive taxsystem is one in which the tax rate increases as the taxpayer's income increases.\n\nPeople with higher incomes pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than those with lower incomes in a progressive system. Progressive taxes include income taxes andestate taxes.\n\nThe argument against progressive taxes is that individuals shouldn't be penalized for having higher incomes and pay for public benefits that a less wealthy individual may be more likely to utilize. This system may also disincentivize innovation andcapitalismbecause there's less motivation for success.\n\nThe argument for progressive taxes is that individuals with lower incomes shouldn't pay higher effective rates simply because they don't have the same income as someone else.\n\nThese two contrasting tax systems meet in the middle with aproportional taxsystem. This tax is one where everyone pays the same amount in proportion to their income regardless of how much they earn.\n\nIndividuals with higher incomes will pay higher proportional taxes in terms of dollars but every individual will pay the same percentage of their income. Some may argue that this is a lose-lose situation because higher taxes aren't collected from the wealthy nor are higher taxes collected from lower-income individuals who might use more public services.\n\nCertain aspects of taxes in the United States relate to a regressive tax system. Sales taxes, property taxes, and excise taxes on select goods are often regressive in the United States.\n\nOther forms of taxes are prevalent within America, however.\n\nIncome taxes and estate taxes are among the most common types of progressive or non-regressive taxes. Both have higher rates and higher tax liabilities for those with higher incomes.\n\nIndividuals can reduce their tax liability in many ways, however. They may have ways to reduce their liability and pay less in taxes both dollar-wise and percent-wise in a progressive system compared to a lower earner even though they're in a higher tax bracket.\n\nYes, a flat tax is the same as a regressive tax because the proportion of taxes paid per individual decreases as their income increases.\n\nYes, tax structures where higher earners pay less proportional taxes are legal. There's often fierce debate about the responsibility of the wealthy regarding how much tax they should pay but the subject is a matter of opinion because there's no legislation limiting or preventing a regressive tax system for certain types of taxes.\n\nRegressive taxes represent a tax structure where a higher burden is placed on low-income individuals because a larger proportion of their income must go toward paying the tax. A regressive tax system is the opposite of a progressive tax system where the wealthier are taxed more. Common forms of a regressive tax system include sales taxes and excise taxes on certain goods.\n\nTax Foundation. \"Regressive Tax.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Progressive Tax.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Property Tax.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Close to Home: A Short Guide to Property Taxes.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Theme 3: Fairness in Taxes.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Contribution and Benefit Base.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Three Taxes That Influence Behavior.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Comparing Regressive, Progressive, and Proportional Taxes.\" Page 1.\n\nTax Foundation. \"Does Your State Have an Estate or Inheritance Tax?\"",
