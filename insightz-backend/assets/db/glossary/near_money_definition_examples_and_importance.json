  "term": "Near Money: Definition, Examples, and Importance",
  "definition": "Near money, sometimes referred to as quasi-money or cash equivalents, is a financial economics term describing non-cash assets that are highlyliquidand easily converted to cash.\n\nNear money is a term that analysts use to understand and quantify the liquidity and nearness ofliquidity for financial assets. Near money considerations are viewed in a variety of market scenarios. Understanding near money and the nearness of near moneys is essential in corporatefinancial statementanalysis and money supply management. Near money can also be important in all types of wealth management as its analysis provides a barometer for cash liquidity, cash equivalents conversion, and risk.\n\nNear money and near moneys (or near monies) comprehensively have been influencing financial analysis and economic considerations for decades. Financial analysts view near money as an important concept for testing liquidity.Central banksand economists utilize the concept of near money in determining the different levels of themoney supply, with the nearness of near moneys serving as a factor for classifying assets as either M1 or M2.\n\nNear moneys generally refer to all of an entity's near money comprehensively. The nearness of near moneys will vary depending on the actual time frames to cash conversion. Other factors affecting near money may also include transactional fees or penalties involved with withdrawals.\n\nExamples of near money assets include savings accounts,certificates of deposit (CDs), foreign currencies,money market accounts, marketable securities, and Treasury bills (T-bills). In general, near money assets included in near money analysis will vary depending on the type of analysis.\n\nInpersonal wealth management, near money can be an important consideration influencing an investor\u2019srisk tolerance. Near money generally includes assets that an investor can easily convert to cash within a few days or months. Investors who depend heavily on the high liquidity of near money will choose very low-risk, short-term near money options such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts, six-month CDs, and T-bills, which offer low annual returns with little risk of loss.\n\nInvestors who have higher cash stockpiles can potentially expand out the nearness of near moneys further to gain higherreturns. For example, two-year CDs have a longer maturity horizon with a greater expected return and are therefore farther out on the spectrum than a six-month CD.\n\nBeyond low-risk near money choices, investors also have higher-risk options such as stocks. These investments can be converted to cash through market trading in approximately a few days, giving them very short-term nearness. However, thevolatilityand risk of stock investments can mean investors have less to cash out for an immediate need.\n\nThe concept of near money and nearness of near moneys is an integral part of financial statement analysis for businesses. It is found in the core ofbalance sheet liquidity analysis. Here, the nearness of near moneys is exemplified through two essential ratios: the quick ratio and the current ratio.\n\nThequick ratiolooks at assets with the shortest nearness, usually 90 days. These assets includecash equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Dividing the combination of these quick assets by current liabilities provides the ratio of a company\u2019s most liquid assets to its current liabilities.\n\nOften viewed in two ways, this ratio shows the value of quick assets per $1 ofcurrent liabilitiesor the coverage level of quick assets to current liabilities. In general, the higher the quick ratio, the more capable a company is of covering its current liabilities with its most liquid assets.\n\nThecurrent ratiopushes slightly farther out on the nearness spectrum with assets that are less liquid than quick assets but still convertible to cash within one year. The current ratio examines a company\u2019s liquidity over a one-year time horizon by dividing all of a company\u2019scurrent assetsby its current liabilities.\n\nEconomists\u2019 analysis and integrations of money supply techniques expand further on the nearness of near moneys concept by breaking down near money assets into nearness tiers. These tiers are classified as M1 and M2.\n\nTheFederal Reserve (Fed)generally has three levers it can use to influence money supply. These levers areopen market operations, the federal funds rate, and bank reserve requirements. Adjusting one or all of these levers can affect the money supply and its different tiers. Thus, money supply levels can be important in comprehensive central bank policy analysis.\n\nWhen making central bank decisions, Federal economists will usually consider M1 and M2 implications:\n\nIn the U.S. the Fed primarily uses M1 and M2 statistics for policy considerations. The Fed stopped reporting M3 in 2006.\n\nNear money is considered part of the M2 money supply.\n\nIn all assessments of near money, it can be important to make the distinction between money and near money. Money includes cash in hand or cash in the bank that can be obtained on demand for use as a medium of transactional exchange. Near money requires some time to cash conversion.\n\nIndividuals and businesses need to have cash money available to meet immediate obligations. In central bank analysis, M1 is primarily composed of real money. Near money is not cash, but rather assets that can be easily converted to cash.\n\nThe realm of near money assets will vary depending on the type of analysis. The nearness of near moneys will also be a factor for consideration when making all types of financial decisions.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"What Is the Money Supply?
