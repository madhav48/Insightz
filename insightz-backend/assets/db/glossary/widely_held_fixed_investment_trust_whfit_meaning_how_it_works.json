  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA widely held fixed investment trust (WHFIT) is a type ofunit investment trust(UIT) with at least one interest held by athird party. Investors who purchase shares of the trust receive any regular payments of interest or dividends earned on the equities or bonds held in trust.\n\nWidely held fixed investment trusts must have at least one third-party interest holder, ormiddleman. Otherwise, they function the same way as any other unit investment trust offering shares in afixed portfolioof assets to prospective investors. Because the investors who fund the initial purchase of the assets in the portfolio typically participate as trust interest holders, widely held fixed investment trusts fall under the category of grantor\u2019s trusts.\n\nTrust interest holders receivedividendorinterestpayments derived from the underlying assets in the portfolio based upon the proportion of shares they hold. The presence of middlemen in the trust means investors may hold either direct interest in the trust or indirect interest if a middleman such as a broker holds the shares in another investor\u2019s name.\n\nWHFITs are classified as pass-through investments for income tax purposes.The parties involved in the creation and maintenance of a WHFIT include:\n\nTheU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)considers unit investment trusts one of three types of investment companies, along with mutual funds andclosed-end funds. Like mutual funds, widely held fixed investment trusts offer investors an opportunity to purchase shares in a diversified portfolio of underlying assets at a lower cost and with less hassle than it would take to build the portfolio independently. Unlike mutual funds, widely held fixed investment trusts offer a static portfolio of assets. They also specify a termination date on which the trust will sell the underlying assets and distribute the proceeds to investors.\n\nThe U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) generally treats widely held investment trusts asflow-through entitiesfor tax purposes. Because of this, the trust itself does not pay taxes on its earnings. Instead, individuals who invest in the trust receive a Form 1099 detailing their annual earnings and must pay taxes on those amounts as they would any other earned income.\n\nOne common variety of widely held fixed investment trust, the widely held mortgage trust, offers portfolios consisting ofmortgageassets. In these cases, the trust typically purchases apool of mortgagesor other similar debt instruments tied to real estate. Investors earn returns based upon the interest collected on the underlying mortgages. The three major federal mortgage lenders, Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae, all periodically issue widely held mortgage trusts.\n\nRelated to this is a real estate mortgage investment conduit (REMIC), which is a\u00a0special purpose vehicle that is used to pool mortgage loans and issuemortgage-backed securities (MBS).Real estate mortgage investment conduits hold commercial and residential mortgages in trust and issue interests in these mortgages to investors.\n\nMutual funds are open-ended funds, meaning that theportfolio managercan buy and sell securities in the portfolio. Theinvestment objectiveof each mutual fund is tooutperforma particularbenchmark, and the portfolio manager trades securities to meet that objective. A stock mutual fund, for example, may have an objective to outperform theStandard & Poor\u2019s 500 indexof large-cap stocks.\n\nMany investors prefer to use mutual funds for stock investing so that the portfolio can be traded. If an investor is interested in buying and holding a portfolio of bonds and earning interest, that individual may purchase a UIT or closed-end fund with a fixed portfolio. A UIT, for example, pays the interest income on the bonds and holds the portfolio until a specific end date when the bonds are sold and the principal amount is returned to the owners. A bond investor can own a diversified portfolio of bonds in a UIT, rather than manage interest payments and bond redemptions in a personalbrokerage account.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 1099-B (2021).\" Accessed Aug. 20, 2021.\n\nWells Fargo. \"Important 2020 Tax Information Widely Held Fixed Income Trust (WHFIT).\" Accessed Aug. 20, 2021.\n\nCornell Law School. \"26 CFR \u00a7 1.671-5 - Reporting for Widely Held Fixed Investment Trusts.\" Accessed Aug. 20, 2021.",
