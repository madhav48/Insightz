  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin model is an economic theory that argues countriesexportwhat they can most efficiently produce. It's also referred to as the H-O model or 2x2x2 model. It evaluates trade equilibrium between two countries with varying specialties and natural resources.\n\nThe model compares a country's export of goods andfactors of productionwith its import of goods it can't produce as efficiently.\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin model was formed from a 1919 Swedish paper by Eli Heckscher at the Stockholm School of Economics. His student, Bertil Ohlin, added to it in 1933. EconomistPaul Samuelsonexpanded the original model through articles written in 1948, 1949, and 1953. Some refer to it as the Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model for this reason.\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin model explains mathematically how a country should operate andtradewhen resources are imbalanced.\u00a0It defines the preferred balance between two countries, each with its resources. It takes the position that countries should ideally export materials and resources that they have an excess of while proportionately importing those resources they need.\n\nThe model isn't limited to tradablecommodities. It incorporates other production factors such as\u00a0labor. According to the model, labor costs vary so countries with cheap labor forces should focus primarily on producing labor-intensive goods.\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin model argues that traded commodities are land, labor, and capital bundles. Trading moves these bundles from places where they are abundant to places where they are scarce.\n\nCertain countries have extensiveoil reservesbut they have very little iron ore. Other countries can easily access and storeprecious metalsbut they have little in the way of agriculture.\n\nThe Netherlands exported almost $696 million in U.S. dollars in 2021 compared to imports of approximately $623 million. Its top import-export partner was Germany.Importing on a close to equal basis allowed it to efficiently and economically manufacture and provide exports.\n\nCrude oil is the most traded commodity around the globe. It's used in automotive fuels, lubricants, and heating oils. Gold, silver, and natural gas are next, followed by coffee, soybeans, and cotton.\n\nTheLinder hypothesisstates that countries with similar incomes require similarly valued products and allow them to trade with each other.It argues that countries with close incomes per capita should focus on trading with each other.\n\nThe cost of labor is the total compensation paid to and for employees including wages, salaries, benefits, and payroll taxes. It's measured by comparing costs incurred for various types of personnel from quarter to quarter or annually. It increased by 0.9% for civilian workers in the second quarter of 2024 and by 4.1% over the previous 12 months as of June 2024.\n\nThe Heckscher-Ohlin model emphasizes the benefits of international trade and the global benefits when each country exports domestically abundant resources. It argues that all countries\u00a0benefit\u00a0when they import the resources they lack. Trading internationally allows countries to adjust to capital-intensive goods production that wouldn't be possible if each country only sold goods internally.\n\nCornell University. \"Heckscher\u2013Ohlin Trade Theory.\" Pages 1, 6.\n\nHarvard University. \"Paul Samuelson\u2019s Contributions to International Economics.\"\n\nPrinceton University. \"The Heckscher-Ohlin Model In Theory and Practice.\"\n\nWorld Integrated Trade Solution. \"Netherlands Trade: At a Glance.\"\n\nATFX. \"What Are the Most Traded Commodities Globally?\"\n\nUniversity of Michigan Gerald R.
