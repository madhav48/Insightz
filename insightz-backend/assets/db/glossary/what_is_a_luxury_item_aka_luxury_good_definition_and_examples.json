As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA\u00a0luxury item\u00a0is not necessary to live, but it is deemed highly desirable within a culture or society. Demand for luxury goods increases when a person's wealth or income increases. Typically, the greater the percentage increase in income, the greater the percentage increase in luxury item purchases.\n\nSince luxury goods are expensive, wealthy people are disproportionate consumers of luxury goods. Those who are not wealthy don't usually buy luxury goods since a greater percentage of their income goes to need-based expenses in order to live. Luxury goods can be consideredconspicuous consumption, which is the purchase of goods mainly or solely to show off one's wealth.\n\nLuxury items tend to be sensitive to a person's income or wealth, meaning that as wealth rises, so do purchases of luxury items. As a result, luxury items\u00a0are considered to show positiveincome elasticity of demand, which is a measure of how responsive the demand is for a good to a change in a person's income. Conversely, if there is a decline in income,\u00a0demand for luxury items will decline.\n\nFor example, demand for large, high-definition (HD) TVs would likely increase as income rises since people have the extra income to splurge on a big TV. However, if arecessionoccurs, which is negative economic growth, causing people to lose their job or experience less income from a lower-paying job, the demand for HD TVs would likely decline. As a result, HD TVs would be considered a luxury item.\n\nLuxury items are the opposite of necessity goods or need expenses, which are the goods that people buy regardless of their income level or wealth. Food, water, and household utilities would likely be considered necessity goods for most people. However, eatingblue lobsterfor dinner would be considered a luxury item.\n\nLuxury items can also refer to services, such as\u00a0full-time or live-in chefs and housekeepers. Some financial services\u00a0can also be considered luxury services by default because persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them.\u00a0Luxury goods also have special luxury packaging\u00a0to differentiate the products from mainstream products of the same category. Of course, the definition of a luxury item is somewhat subjective, depending on a person's financial circumstances. For example, one might consider a car a luxury item while another might consider it a necessity.\n\nAninferior goodis a good that experiences less demand as a person's income increases. As a result, it has a negative elasticity of demand. For example, cheap, store-brand coffee would likely see an increase in demand when people's income is low. However, when their income increases, the demand for store-brand coffee would decline as people opt for the more expensive, higher-quality coffee. As a result, the store brand coffee would be an inferior good.\n\nLuxury items are not inferior goods; instead, they're the goods that people opt to buy when their income increases to replace inferior goods.\n\nA luxury good may become an\u00a0inferior good\u00a0at different income levels. For example, if a wealthy person gets wealthy enough, they\u00a0may stop\u00a0buying increasing numbers of\u00a0luxury cars\u00a0in order\u00a0to start collecting airplanes or yachts\u2014because, at the higher income levels, the luxury car would become an inferior good.\n\nAlthough the designation of an item as a\u00a0luxury item\u00a0doesn't necessarily translate to high\u00a0quality, such goods are often considered to be on the\u00a0highest end of the market in terms of quality and price.\n\nSome luxury products purport\u00a0to be examples ofVeblen goods, which are goods that see their demand rise because they're considered status symbols. In other words, as the price of the good increases, so too does demand, as people perceive it has a higher value. As a result, Veblen goods have a positiveprice elasticity of demand, which measures the change in demand as a result of a change in price. For example, raising the price on a bottle of perfume can increase\u00a0its perceived value, which can cause\u00a0sales to increase, rather than decrease.\n\nCertain luxury items may be subjected to a specific tax orluxury tax. Large or expensive recreational boats or automobiles can be subject to a federal tax. For example, the U.S. levied a luxury tax on certain automobiles in the 1990s but ended the tax in 2003.Luxury taxes are considered progressive because they typically only affect people with high net wealth or income.\n\nAlthough luxury items can be different from one person to another, the following items are considered luxury items in an economy:\n\nDouglas Curtis and Ian Irvine. \u201cPrinciples of Microeconomics 4.5: The Income Elasticity of Demand.\u201d LibreTexts, 2023.\n\nCongress.gov. \u201cH.R.5835 - Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.\u201d Page 104 Stat. 1388-439.\n\nCongress.gov. \u201cH.R.3448 - Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996.\u201d 110 Stat. 1839.",
