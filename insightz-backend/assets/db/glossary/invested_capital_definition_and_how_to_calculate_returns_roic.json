Businesses secure capital by issuing new securities to investors (equity) or by borrowing money (debt). This money is used to acquire assets and generate profits. A company'sreturn on invested capital (ROIC)can tell you how well its capital is used to make a profit. You won't find invested capital on corporate financial statements because debt, capital leases, and stockholders' equity are each listed separately on company balance sheets.\n\nCompanies must generate more in earnings than the cost to raise the capital provided by bondholders, shareholders, and other financing sources, or else the firm does not earn aneconomic profit.\n\nBusinesses use several metrics to assess how well the company uses capital, including return on invested capital,economic value added, andreturn on capital employed.\n\nA firm\u2019s total capitalization is the sum total of debt, including capital leases, issued plus equity sold to investors, and the two types of capital are reported in different sections of the balance sheet. Assume, for example, that IBM issues 1,000 shares of $10 par value stock, and each share is sold for a total of $30 per share.\n\nIn the stockholder\u2019s equity section of the balance sheet, IBM increases the common stock balance for the total par value of $10,000, and the remaining $20,000 received increases the additional paid-in capital account.\n\nOn the other hand, if IBM issues $50,000 in corporate bond debt, the long-term debt section of the balance sheet increases by $50,000. In total, IBM\u2019s capitalization increases by $80,000, due to issuing both new stock and new debt.\n\nA successful company maximizes therate of returnit earns on the capital it raises, and investors look carefully at how businesses use the proceeds received from issuing stock and debt. Assume, for example, that a plumbing company issues $60,000 in additional shares of stock and uses the sales proceeds to buy more plumbing trucks and equipment.\n\nIf the plumbing firm can use the new assets to perform more residential plumbing work, the company\u2019s earnings increase and the business can pay a dividend to shareholders. The dividend increases each investor\u2019s rate of return on a stock investment, and investors also profit from stock price increases, which are driven by increasing company earnings and sales.\n\nCompanies may also use a portion of earnings to buy back stock previously issued to investors and retire the stock, and a stock repurchase plan reduces the number of shares outstanding and lowers the equity balance.\n\nAnalysts also look closely at a firm\u2019searnings per share(EPS), or the net income earned per share of stock. If the business repurchases shares, the number of outstanding shares decreases, and that means that the EPS increases, which makes the stock more attractive to investors.\n\nReturn on invested capital (ROIC) is a calculation used to assess a company's efficiency in allocating the capital under its control to profitable investments.\n\nThe return on invested capital\u00a0ratio gives a sense of how well a company is using its money to generate returns. Comparing a company's return on invested capital\u00a0with itsweighted average\u00a0cost of capital (WACC)reveals whether invested capital is being used effectively. This measure is also known simply as return on capital.\n\nROIC is always calculated as a percentage and is usually expressed as an annualized or trailing 12-month value. It should be compared to a company's cost of capital to determine whether the company is creating value. If ROIC is greater than a firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the most common cost of capital metric, value is being created and these firms will trade at a premium.\n\nA common benchmark for evidence of value creation is a return of over 2% of the firm's cost of capital. If a company's ROIC is less than 2%, it is considered a value destroyer. Some firms run at a zero-return level, and while they may not be destroying value, these companies have no excess capital to invest in future growth.\n\nROIC\u00a0is one of themost important and informative valuation metricsto calculate. That said, it is more important for some sectors than others since companies that operate oil rigs or manufacture semiconductors invest capital much more intensively than those that require less equipment.\n\nCapital invested is calculated as, Capital Invested = Total Equity + Total Debt (including capital leases) + Non-Operating Cash.\n\nIf a private company decides to go public, has an initial public offering, and sells one million shares to raise $17 million, that is an example of capital invested. Similarly, if a company decides to sell $10 million worth of bonds with a coupon of 3%, that is an example of capital invested. Capital investments are generally understood to be land, buildings, and equipment.\n\nA good return on invested capital (ROIC) is considered to be 2% and above. Conversely, a business is thought to be destroying capital if it has an ROIC of less than 2%.\n\nInvested capital is the total amount of money a company raises through the sale of shares and the issuance of bonds; a mix of both equity and debt financing. A company can have either all equity financing, all debt financing, or a combination of both. Businesses raise capital in order to finance business needs, such as growth and maintenance.",
