  "definition": "Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nThe plowback ratio indicates the profit kept by a company after accounting for dividends paid.\n\nThe plowback ratio is a financial metric infundamental analysisthat shows the portion of a company's earnings that is reinvested in the business rather than distributed to shareholders as dividends. It is most often referred to as theretention ratio. The opposite metric, measuring how much in dividends are paid out as a percentage of earnings, is known as the payout ratio.\n\nThe plowback ratio is calculated by subtracting the quotient of the annual dividends per share and earnings per share (EPS) from 1. On the other hand, it can be calculated by determining the leftover funds upon calculating thedividend payout ratio.\n\n\ufeff\ufeff\\text{Retention Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Net Income } -\\text{ Dividends}}{\\text{Net Income}}Retention\u00a0Ratio=Net\u00a0IncomeNet\u00a0Income\u2212Dividends\u200b\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOn a per-share basis, the retention ratio can be expressed as:\n\n\ufeff1\u2212Dividends\u00a0per\u00a0ShareEPS1-\\frac{\\text{Dividends per Share}}{\\text{EPS}}1\u2212EPSDividends\u00a0per\u00a0Share\u200b\ufeff\ufeff\n\nFor example, a company that reports $10 of EPS and $2 per share of dividends will have a dividend payout ratio of 20% and a plowback ratio of 80%.\n\nThe plowback ratio is an indicator of how much profit is retained in a business rather than paid out to investors. Younger businesses tend to have higher plowback ratios. These faster-growing companies are more focused on business development. More mature businesses are not as reliant on reinvesting profits to expand operations. The ratio is 100% for companies that do not pay dividends, and is zero for companies that pay out their entire net income as dividends.\n\nUse of the plowback ratio is most useful when comparing companies within the same industry. Different markets require different utilization of profits. For example, it is not uncommon for technology companies to have a plowback ratio of 1 (that is, 100%). This indicates that no dividends are issued, and all profits are retained for business growth.\n\nThe plowback ratio represents the portion ofretained earningsthat could potentially be dividends. Higher retention ratios indicate management\u2019s belief in high-growth periods and favorable business economic conditions. Lower plowback ratio computations indicate a wariness in future business growth opportunities or satisfaction in current cash holdings.\n\nThe plowback ratio is a useful metric for determining what companies\u00a0invest in. Investors preferring cash distributions avoid companies with high plowback ratios. However, companies with higher plowback ratios could have a greater chance\u00a0of\u00a0capital gains, achieved through appreciated stock prices during the growth of the organization. Investors see stable plowback ratio calculations as indicators of current stable decision-making that can help shape future expectations.\n\nThe ratio is typically higher forgrowth companiesthat are experiencing rapid increases in revenues and profits. A growth company would prefer to plow earnings back into its business if it believes that it can reward its shareholders by increasing revenues and profits at a faster pace than shareholders could achieve by investing their dividend receipts.\n\nBecause management determines the dollar amount of dividends to issue, management directly impacts the plowback ratio. Alternatively, the calculation of the plowback ratio requires the use of EPS, which is influenced by a company\u2019s choice ofaccounting method. Therefore, the plowback ratio is highly influenced by only a few variables within the organization.\n\nFor example, on Nov. 29, 2017, The Walt Disney Company declared a $0.84 semi-annual cash dividend per share to shareholders of record Dec. 11, to be paid Jan. 11.As of thefiscal year endedSept. 30, 2017, the company's EPS was $5.73.Its plowback (retention) ratio is, therefore, 1 - ($0.84 / $5.73) = 0.8534, or 85.34%.\n\nThe retention ratio is the converse concept to the dividend payout ratio. The dividend payout ratio evaluates the percentage of profits earned that a company pays out to its shareholders. It is calculated simply as dividends per share divided byearnings per share(EPS). Using the Disney example above, the payout ratio is $0.84/$5.73 = 14.66%. This is intuitive, as you know that a company keeps any money that it doesn't pay out. Of its total net income of $8.98 billion, Disney will pay out 14.66% and retain 85.34%.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company. \"The Walt Disney Company Announces Semi-Annual Cash Dividend of $0.84 per Share.\" Accessed Nov. 16, 2020.\n\nThe Walt Disney Company. \"Fiscal Year 2017 Annual Financial Report,\" Page 24.
