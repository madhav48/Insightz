  "term": "Yield Tilt Index Fund",
  "definition": "A yield tilt index fund is a type of fund that invests in stocks or securities that mirrors the holdings of amarket indexbut contains a higher weighting towards higher-yielding investments. A yield tilt index fund can be amutual fund, which is a basket of securities that areactively managedby a portfolio or fund manager.\n\nA yield tilt index fund can also be anexchange-traded fund(ETF), which merely mirrors an index of stocks.\n\nTypically, an index fund would contain all of the stocks of a particular stock index, such as theStandard & Poor's 500 Index(S&P 500). Investors can't buy an index per se, since it's merely a tracking mechanism containing a collection of stocks designed to provide investors with the overall trend for those stocks.\n\nInstead, investors would need to buy a fund that contains all of those stocks within the index. For example, there are ETFs that contain all 500 of the stocks in the S&P 500. However, if investors want to own the index, while also increasing their return, they can invest in atilt fund.\n\nTilted funds contain all of the stocks of a benchmark index but are enhanced with investments that tilt the fund in the direction of a specific investment strategy or financial goal. For example, many stocks paydividends, which are usually cash payments paid to investors as a reward for owning a stock. A tilted fund might mirror an index but also contain more shares of the stocks that pay high dividends.\n\nA yield tilt index fund enhances the income of a standard index fund by weighting its holdings towards stocks that pay higher dividends. In other words, attractive dividend-paying stocks are given a greater portfolio weighting, making them represent more of the fund's portfolio than they otherwise would in the standard index. The fund's yield is \u201ctilted\u201d due to the heavier weighting in that direction.\n\nIn this way, the fund is tilted towards earning higher-than-normal dividend income, while also keeping with the overall investment strategy of owning the benchmark index.\n\nA yield tilt index fund allows for the fund to be able to outperform the yield from the baseline fund. Also, many dividend-paying stocks are of well-established companies since they need to generate consistent earnings to keep up with paying quarterly dividends.\n\nAs a result, a fund that's tilted toward dividend-paying companies can also enhance the returns from the investments in the fund since it's overweighted with more profitable companies.\n\nSince the investment strategy of a yield tilt index fund uses a baseline benchmark index, the fund is diversified, meaning the invested dollars are spread out over many companies. Thisdiversificationreduces the risk of loss if a few of the companies within the fund fall into financial difficulties. The other remaining companies can stilloutperform, which partially offsets the drag on the fund from the underperformers.\n\nSince the fund is merely tilted towards dividend-paying stocks, the fund can continue to keep pace with the direction of the overall market, while boosting dividend income with little additional risk.\n\nIf a yield tilt index fund has the proper mix of investments, it can provide investors with an enhanced yield along with the safety that comes with investing in index funds.\n\nThe structure of a yield tilt index fund can offer some tax benefits for investors who are seeking a way to minimize the tax liability associated with their holdings. Dividend payments issued to shareholders can be subject todouble taxation. This means that they are taxed once at the corporate level and then once again at the shareholder level. So the investor is essentially paying income taxes twice on the same single amount of income.\n\nProponents of this taxation structure see it as a way to ensure the wealthy are paying their fair share, and cannot get rich off their investment earnings without paying a sufficient amount of taxes in return. Opponents, on the other hand, contend that this dual-level taxation is unfair and imposes an additional penalty on successful investors.\n\nDue to the effect of double taxation, some investors contend that the market must value the share prices of high-yield stocks at somewhat of a discount to other stocks, so as to provide an increased return on high-yield stocks in order to compensate for the negative tax effects. The theory is that an investor who is able to purchase a yield tilt index fund in atax-shelteredinvestment account\u2014such as aretirement account\u2014might be able to outperform the index since they receive the supposed valuation benefit but are sheltered from taxes on the dividends they receive.\n\nRoth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars\u2014this means that the contributions are not tax-deductible, but once you start withdrawing funds, the money is tax-free.\n\nThis strategy would be a potentially smart option for a sophisticated investor who understands the intricate details of this structure, is familiar with the tax regulations involved, or has a financial advisor who is well-versed in the tax code.\n\nInvestors will find that the tax-advantaged strategy of holding yield tilt index funds in tax-sheltered accounts means that they will be purchasing these types of funds as an ETF. The investor would purchase the ETF through the custodian who manages their tax-sheltered account such as Schwab, Fidelity, or maybe arobo-advisor.\n\nFrom that point, the security is purchased and all an investor needs to do is let the dividend strategy develop in their account. A common tax-advantaged account that could use this strategy would be aRoth IRA. Many investors will choose to purchase these funds through their brokerage account instead of with the fund directly, as the index fund they intend to purchase is usually only a portion of their portfolio. Having a brokerage account allows for greater purchasing diversity versus investing with the fund directly, although often at the cost of additional fees, such as trading commissions.\n\nThere are tax considerations when using an index fund, as well as expense ratios, that could eat away at areturn on investment(ROI). An index fund will not necessarily deliver the highest return, but this comes with the benefit of diversification. Diversification alleviates some aspects of risk and is considered a must in any investment portfolio.\n\nIt is nearly impossible to lose all your money in an index fund. For this to happen, every single stock that comprises the fund will need to go to zero. Not only this, but the owner of the fund would need to declare bankruptcy and be unable to sell any of their assets in order to pay back the holders of the fund. Neither of these scenarios is likely to happen.\n\nCertain index funds pay dividends as the fund receives dividends from the stocks they hold in the fund. Others will reinvest the dividends into their fund and although the investor who holds shares in the index fund won't receive an actual dividend, the reinvestment will be apparent in the appreciation of the fund's share price.\n\nAdividend yield fundis a fund that tracks an index of companies that have a history of paying regular, high dividends. These funds will seek to mirror the performance of the underlying index. Investors who favor a dividend-based strategy will lean heavily on these funds for the core of their investment portfolio.\n\nYield tilt index funds can be a great way for investors to track an index while also pursuing dividend-based strategy goals. These types of funds offer the risk-averse nature inherent in diversification while providing a lean, or tilt, towards those companies who produce regular dividends. Investors looking to reinvest dividend growth back into their portfolio, such as with adividend reinvestment plan(DRIP), should consider tilt funds to meet their investment objectives.\n\nTax Foundation. \"Double Taxation of Corporate Income in the United States and the OECD.\"",
