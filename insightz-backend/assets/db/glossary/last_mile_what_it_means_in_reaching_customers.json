  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe last mile describes the short geographical segment of delivery of communication and media services or the delivery of products to customers located in dense areas.\u00a0Last mile logistics tend to be complex and costly to providers of goods and services who deliver to these areas.\n\nDelivery of telecommunications and media content is instantaneous and very fast for physical products to the perimeter of a densely populated area. Imagine a trunk line leading to the edge of a city or metropolitan area.\n\nThe branches and leaves must then spread out across the tightly packed buildings and streets to serve customers working and living there. The edge of the city to the customer inside the city is the last mile.\n\nCommunications and media providers\u2014inclusive ofbroadbandcable, satellite, and wireless\u2014spend heavily to upgrade old delivery systems and build out new networks to ensure adequate bandwidth for consumers hungry for data and streaming capabilities on their televisions, desktop computers, and mobile devices.\n\nIt takes time for these service providers to implement technology solutions for the \"last mile problem.\" Due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, these solutions are at risk of being obsolete, or not state-of-the-art, upon completion.\n\nLast mile logistics for product delivery have become a central focus for retailers in the e-commerce era. Our instant-gratification society demands fast delivery of products ordered online. Retailers that can achieve this at low or no cost to the customer havecompetitive advantages.\n\nAmazon utilizes third-party services and its own fleet of vehicles to deliver packages to its customers over the last mile. To compete, other retailers are investing more in setting updistribution centersas close as possible to metropolitan zones, and then contracting with UPS, USPS, FedEx, and local courier services to perform last mile delivery services.\n\nIn urban areas, deliveries to retail stores, restaurants, and other merchants in a central business district often contribute to congestion and safety problems, making the last mile even more challenging to execute.\n\nThe last mile problem has reemerged in the past few years in the context ofcryptocurrencies. In particular, the last mile, in this case, refers to when a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin is used in a cross-border payment such as aremittance.\n\nThe recipient of the Bitcoin must find a way to exchange it for local currency in order to use it. Thus, while crypto transactions can provide a quick, efficient, and cost-effective way of sending remittances, the last mile problem still stands in the way in many less-developed countries.\n\nLast mile refers to the last stage in a process, especially of a customer buying goods. When it is used in the context of transportation, supply chain, manufacturing, and retailing, the last mile is used to describe the delivery of products as the last leg of transportation.\n\nIn supply chain management, the last mile describes the difficult last part of the transportation of packages from hubs to their final destinations. Some of the problems of last-mile delivery include minimizing cost, ensuring transparency, increasing efficiency, and improving infrastructure.\n\nThe very last part of the delivery process of a product\u2014from the last distribution center to the end customer\u2014tends to be the most difficult because it can be the most complicated and expensive.\n\nIn Internet\u00a0industries, the last mile refers to the final leg of the\u00a0telecommunications networks\u00a0that deliver telecommunication services to customers. It is the portion of the telecommunications network chain that physically reaches the customer's premises.\n\nThe first mile problem is generally used in the context of public transit systems. The first/last mile is the distance between a traveler\u2019s origin or destination and a transit station. Reducing this distance is considered to be the solution to both the first mile and the last mile problem.\n\nThe last mile refers to the last stage in the delivery of media communication or physical goods to a consumer. Last mile logistics can be costly and require a significant amount of planning to be timely and efficient.\n\nUniversity of Michigan. \"Potential Solutions to the First Mile/Last Mile Problem.\"",
