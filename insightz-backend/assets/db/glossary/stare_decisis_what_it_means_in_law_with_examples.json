  "term": "Stare Decisis: What It Means in Law, With Examples",
  "definition": "Stare decisis is a legal doctrine that obligates courts to follow historical cases when making a ruling on a similar case. Stare decisis ensures that cases with similar scenarios and facts are approached in the same way. Simply put, it binds courts to follow legal precedents set by\u00a0previous decisions.\n\nStare decisis is a Latin term meaning \u201cto stand by that which is decided.\u201d\n\nThe U.S.common lawstructure has a unified system of deciding legal matters with the principle of stare decisis at its core, making the concept of legal precedent extremely important. A prior ruling or judgment on any case is known as aprecedent. Stare decisis dictates that courts look to precedents when overseeing an ongoing case with similar circumstances.\n\nA legal precedent is a prior ruling or judgment on any case. Stare decisis requires courts to look at precedents when overseeing an ongoing case with similar circumstances.\n\nA unique case with hardly any past reference material may become a precedent when the judge makes a ruling on it. Also, the new ruling on a similar present case replaces any precedent that has been overruled in a current case. Under the rule of stare decisis, courts are obligated to uphold their previous rulings or the rulings made by higher courts within the same court system.\n\nFor example, the Kansas stateappellate courtswill follow their precedent, the Kansas Supreme Court precedent, and the U.S. Supreme Court precedent. Kansas is not obligated to follow precedents from the appellate courts of other states\u2014say, California. However, when faced with a unique case, Kansas may refer to the precedent of California or any other state that has an established ruling as a guide in setting its precedent.\n\nIn effect, all courts are bound to follow the rulings of the Supreme Court, as the highest court in the country.Therefore, decisions that the highest court makes become binding precedent or obligatory stare decisis for the lower courts in the system. When the Supreme Court overturns a precedent made by courts below it in the legal hierarchy, the new ruling will become stare decisis on similar court hearings. If a case ruled in a Kansas court, which has abided by a certain precedent for decades, is taken to the U.S. Supreme Court and is then overturned by that court, the Supreme Court\u2019s overrule replaces the former precedent, and Kansas courts would need to adapt to the new rule as precedent.\n\nIn rare cases, the Supreme Court has reversed its own previous rulings\u2014David Schultz, professor of law at the University of Minnesota and professor of political science at Hamline University, reports that from 1789 to 2020, the court did so 145 times out of \u201c25,544 Supreme Court opinions and judgments after oral arguments.\u201d This amounts to barely one-half of 1%.\n\nThe most famous reversal to date, Schultz notes, is 1954\u2019s Brown v. Board of Education. That decision reversed the separate-but-equal doctrine ruling of Plessy v. Ferguson in 1896, which supported segregation.\n\nThe most recent and controversial overturning of a precedent occurred on June 24, 2022, when the court reversed Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that legalized abortion, making Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization the next major case to depart from stare decisis.\n\nInsider tradingin the securities industry is the misuse ofmaterial nonpublic informationfor financial gain. The insider can trade the information for their portfolio or sell the information to an outsider for a cost. The precedent looked to by courts when dealing with insider trading is the 1983 case of Dirks v. SEC. In this case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that insiders are guilty if they directly or indirectly received material benefits from disclosing the information to someone who acts on it.In addition, exploiting confidential information exists when the information is gifted to a relative or friend. This decision became precedent and is upheld by courts dealing with financial crimes that are similar in nature.\n\nIn the 2016 ruling of Salman v. the United States, the Supreme Court used stare decisis to make the ruling. Bassam Salman made an estimated $1.5 million from insider information that he received indirectly from his brother-in-law, Maher Kara, then a Citigroup investment banker. While Salman\u2019s counsel believed that he should be convicted only if he compensated his brother-in-law in cash or kind, the Supreme Court judge ruled that insiders do not have to get something in return for divulging company secrets. Based on stare decisis, the confidential information given to Salman was considered a gift\u2014as Dirks v. SEC makes it clear that fiduciary duty is breached when a tipper gives confidential information as a gift. Salman was therefore found guilty of insider trading.\n\nIn 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York overturned the insider trading conviction of twohedge fundmanagers, Todd Newman and Anthony Chiasson, stating an insider can be convicted only if the misappropriated information produced a real personal benefit.When Bassam Salam appealed his 2013 conviction using the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling as precedent, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit based in San Francisco did not abide by the Second Circuit\u2019s precedent, which it was not obligated to uphold. The appeals court upheld the conviction ruling on Salman.\n\nAs noted above, Salman appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, stating that the Second Circuit\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with the Supreme Court precedent set about byDirksv. SEC and the appeals court had, therefore, not adhered to the principle of stare decisis. The Supreme Court disagreed and upheld the conviction. \u201cSalman\u2019s conduct is in the heartland of Dirks\u2019s rule concerning gifts,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \u201cStare Decisis.\u201d\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \u201cPrecedent.\u201d\n\nSupreme Court of the United States. \u201cAbout the Court.\u201d\n\nThe Conversation. \u201cThe Supreme Court Has Overturned Precedent Dozens of Times in the Past 60 Years, Including When It Struck Down Legal Segregation.\u201d\n\nBallotpedia. \u201cDobbs v.
