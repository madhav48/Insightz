  "definition": "Learn how to measure the magnitude of price changes in 11 minutes\n\nGordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe RSI is a momentum oscillator that is widely used in technical analysis of stocks and commodities to identify changes in momentum and price direction.\n\nThe relative strength index (RSI) is amomentum indicatorused in technical analysis. RSI measures the speed and magnitude of a security's recent price changes to detect overbought or oversold conditions in the price of that security.\n\nThe RSI is displayed as anoscillator(a line graph) on a scale of zero to 100. The indicator was developed by J. Welles Wilder Jr. and introduced in his seminal 1978 book,New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems.\n\nIn addition to identifying overbought and oversold securities, the RSI can also indicate securities that may be primed for a trend reversal or a corrective pullback in price. It can signal when to buy and sell. Traditionally, an RSI reading of 70 or above indicates an overbought condition. A reading of 30 or below indicates an oversold condition.\n\nThe RSI is one of the most popular technical indicators, and it is generally available on most trading platforms offered byonline stock brokers.\n\nAs a momentum indicator, the relative strength index compares a security's strength on days when prices go up to its strength on days when prices go down. Relating the result of this comparison to price action can give traders an idea of how a security may perform.The RSI, especially whenused in conjunction with other technical indicators, can help traders make better-informed trading decisions.\n\nThe RSI uses a two-part calculation that starts with the following formula:\n\nRSIstep\u00a0one=100\u2212[1001+Average\u00a0gainAverage\u00a0loss]RSI_{\\text{step one}} = 100- \\left[ \\frac{100}{ 1 + \\frac{\\text{Average gain}}{\\text{Average loss} }} \\right]RSIstep\u00a0one\u200b=100\u2212[1+Average\u00a0lossAverage\u00a0gain\u200b100\u200b]\n\nThe average gain or loss used in this calculation is the average percentage gain or loss during a look-back period. The formula uses a positive value for the average loss. Periods with price losses are counted as zero in the calculations of average gain. Periods with price increases are counted as zero in the calculations of average loss.The standard number of periods used to calculate the initial RSI value is 14.For example, imagine the market closed higher seven out of the past 14 days with an initial average gain of 1%.The remaining seven days all closed lower with an initial average loss of \u22120.8%.\n\nThe first calculation for the RSI would look like the following expanded calculation:\n\n55.55=100\u2212[1001+(1%14)(0.8%14)]55.55 = 100 - \\left [ \\frac {100 }{ 1 + \\frac{ \\left ( \\frac{ 1\\% }{ 14 } \\right) }{ \\left( \\frac{ 0.8\\% }{ 14 } \\right)} } \\right ]55.55=100\u2212\u200b1+(140.8%\u200b)(141%\u200b)\u200b100\u200b\u200b\n\nOnce there are 14 periods of data available, the second calculation can be done. Its purpose is to smooth the results so that the RSI only nears 100 or zero in a stronglytrending market.\n\nRSIstep\u00a0two=100\u2212[1001+(Previous\u00a0Average\u00a0Gain\u00d713)+Current\u00a0Gain((Previous\u00a0Average\u00a0Loss\u00d713)+Current\u00a0Loss)]RSI_{\\text{step two}} = 100 - \\left [ \\frac{ 100 }{ 1 + \\frac{ \\left ( \\text{Previous Average Gain} \\times 13 \\right ) \\ + \\ \\text{Current Gain} }{ \\left ( \\left ( \\text{Previous Average Loss} \\times 13 \\right ) \\ + \\ \\text{Current Loss} \\right ) } } \\right ]RSIstep\u00a0two\u200b=100\u2212[1+((Previous\u00a0Average\u00a0Loss\u00d713)+Current\u00a0Loss)(Previous\u00a0Average\u00a0Gain\u00d713)+Current\u00a0Gain\u200b100\u200b]\n\nAfter the RSI is calculated, the RSI indicator can be plotted, usually beneath an asset\u2019s price chart, as shown below. The RSI will rise as the number and size of up days increase. It will fall as the number and size of down days increase.\n\nAs you can see in the above chart, the RSI indicator can stay in the overbought region for extended periods while the stock is in anuptrend. The indicator may also remain in oversold territory for a long time when the stock is in adowntrend. This can be confusing for new analysts, but learning to use the indicator within the context of the prevailing trend will clarify these issues.\n\nThe primary trend of the security\u00a0is important to know to properly understand RSI readings. For example, well-known market technician Constance Brown, CMT, proposed that an oversold reading by the RSI in an uptrend is probably much higher than 30. Likewise, an overbought reading during a downtrend is much lower than 70.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, during a downtrend, the RSI peaks near 50 rather than 70. This could be seen by traders as more reliably signaling bearish conditions.\n\nMany investors create a horizontaltrendlinebetween the levels of 30 and 70 when a strong trend is in place to better identify the overall trend and extremes.\n\nOn the other hand, modifying overbought or oversold RSI levels when the price of a stock or asset is in a long-term horizontal channel or trading range (rather than a strong upward or downward trend) is usually unnecessary.\n\nThe relative strength indicator is not as reliable intrending marketsas it is in trading ranges. In fact, most traders understand that the signals given by the RSI in strong upward or downward trends often can be false.\n\nA related concept focuses ontrade signalsand techniques that conform to the trend. In other words, using bullish signals primarily when the price is in a bullish trend and bearish signals primarily when a stock is in a bearish trend may help traders avoid the false alarms that the RSI can generate in trending markets.\n\nA number of RSI levels can be considered bullish, depending on whether the market is trending up or down or is rangebound.\n\nOne bullish signal is when the RSI crosses below 30, where it would be consideredoversold. But as noted above, bullish RSI signals are best used in uptrends. In a strong downtrend, the trend can continue well after momentum indicators have hit oversold levels. In addition, any trade entered on this signal may offer limited upside, since you\u2019d likely be trading against a strong, recent trend.\n\nFollowing a strong uptrend, another bullish RSI signal is a reversal after a decline to around 40-50, an area considered support during an uptrend. This is often confirmation of a positive momentum shift back toward the uptrend after a pullback, signaling potential for continued gains.\n\nBearish signals from the RSI appear much like bullish ones but in reverse. A basic bearish signal is when the RSI crosses above 70, anoverboughtlevel. If this is followed by a move below 70, upward momentum may be weakening, alerting traders to a potential price reversal.But again, bearish RSI signals are best used in downtrends.\n\nDuring a strong downtrend, one bearish RSI signal is a reversal after a rise to around 50-60. This is often confirmation of a momentum shift back toward the downside after a pullback, signaling potential for continued declines.\n\nDuringtrends, the RSI readings may fall into a band or range. During a stronguptrend, the RSI tends to stay well above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a strongdowntrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, while it frequently hits 30 or below.\n\nThese guidelines can help tradersdetermine trend strength and spot potential reversals. For example, if the RSI can\u2019t reach 70 on a number of consecutive price swings during an uptrend, but then drops below 30, the trend is likely breaking down.\n\nThe opposite is true for a downtrend. If the downtrend is unable to reach 30 or below and then rallies above 70, that downtrend has broken down and could be reversing to the upside. Trend lines andmoving averagesare helpful technical tools to include when using the RSI in this way.\n\nBe sure not to confuse RSI and relative strength. The first refers to changes in the price momentum of one security. The second compares the price performance of two or more securities.\n\nAn RSI divergence occurs when the indicator and price begin to reach different levels, indicating a change in momentum that precedes a change in price direction. For example, a bullishdivergenceoccurs when the security makes a lower low but the indicator forms a higher low. This indicates rising bullish momentum and could be used to trigger a newlong position.\n\nA bearish divergence occurs when price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high.This indicates a possible shift to downside momentum.\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, a bullish divergence was identified when the RSI formed a series of higher lows as the price formed lower lows. This was a valid signal, but divergences can be misleading when a stock is in a stable long-term trend. In that case, numerous divergences can be seen before a reversal occurs. Using flexible oversold or overbought readings will help identify more potential signals.\n\nAn additional price-RSI relationship that traders watch for is positive and negative RSI reversals. These are the opposite of bearish and bullish divergences. A positive RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a lower low at the same time a security's price reaches a higher low. Traders would consider this formation a bullish sign and a buy signal.\n\nConversely, a negative RSI reversal may take place once the RSI reaches a high that is higher that its previous high at the same time that a security's price reaches a lower high. This formation would be a bearish sign and a sell signal.\n\nAnother trading technique examines RSI behavior when it is reemerging from overbought or oversold territory. This signal is called a swing rejection. A bullish swing rejection has four parts:\n\nAs you can see in the following chart, the RSI indicator was oversold, broke up through 30, and formed the rejection low that triggered the signal when it bounced higher. Using the RSI in this way is very similar to drawing trend lines on a price chart.\n\nThere is a bearish version of the swing rejection signal that is a mirror image of the bullish version. A bearish swing rejection also has four parts:\n\nThe following chart illustrates the bearish swing rejection signal. As with most trading techniques, this signal will be most reliable when it conforms to the prevailing long-term trend. Bearish signals during downward trends are less likely to generate false alarms.\n\nThemoving average convergence divergence (MACD)is another\u00a0trend-following momentum\u00a0indicator that shows the relationship between two\u00a0moving averages\u00a0of a security\u2019s price. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-periodexponential moving average (EMA)from the 12-period EMA. The result of that calculation is the MACD line.\n\nA nine-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line, is then plotted on top of the MACD line. It can function as a trigger for buy and sell signals.Traders may buy the security when the MACD crosses above its signal line and sell, or short, the security when the MACD crosses below the signal line.\n\nThe RSI was designed to indicate whether a security is overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. It's calculated using average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods, with values bounded from 0 to 100.\n\nThe MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while theRSI measures price change momentumin relation to recent price highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to provideanalystswith a more complete technical picture of a market.\n\nBothindicators measure the momentumof an asset. However, they measure different factors and may sometimes give contradictory indications.\n\nFor example, the RSI may show a reading above 70 for a sustained period of time, indicating a security isoverextendedon the buy side.At the same time, the MACD could indicate that buying momentum is still increasing for the security. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (the price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).\n\nThe RSI compares bullish and bearish price momentum and displays the results in an oscillator placed beneath a price chart. Like most technical indicators, its signals are most reliable when they conform to the long-term trend.\n\nTrue reversal signals are rare and can be difficult to separate from false alarms. A false positive, for example, would be a bullish crossover followed by a sudden decline in a stock. A false negative would be a situation where there is a bearish crossover, yet the stock suddenly accelerated upward.\n\nSince the indicator displays momentum, it can stay overbought or oversold for a long time when an asset has significant momentum in either direction. Therefore, the RSI is most useful in an oscillating market (a trading range) where the asset price is alternating between bullish and bearish movements.\n\nThis question could refer to the time frame used in an RSI calculation. Choosing the right RSI period depends on your trading style, time frame, and market conditions. The default is a 14-period time frame, which provides a balanced response to price changes and is well-suited to swing and position trading. Using shorter periods between 5 and 9 makes the RSI more sensitive, appealing to day traders who want to capture quick momentum shifts, though they tend to generate more noise. Meanwhile, using longer periods, such as 21 to 30, suits long-term investors looking to capture major trends.\n\nOn the other hand, a \"good RSI number\" could also refer to RSI levels. When the RSI is below 30, it signals that the security could be oversold or undervalued \u2014 meaning it could be a good time to buy. When the RSI is above 70, it signals that the security could be overbought or overvalued \u2014 meaning it could be a good time to sell. An RSI of 50 signals a neutral balance between bullish and bearish positions.\n\nSome traders consider it a buy signal if a security\u2019s RSI reading moves below 30. This is based on the idea that the security has been oversold and is therefore poised for a rebound. However, the reliability of this signal will depend on the overall context. If the security is caught in a significant downtrend, then it might continue trading at an oversold level for quite some time. Traders in that situation might delay buying until they see other technical indicators confirm their buy signal.\n\nAs the relative strength index is mainly used to determine whether a security is overbought or oversold, a high RSI reading can mean that a security is overbought and the price may drop. Therefore, it can be a signal to sell the security.\n\nRSI and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are both momentum measurements that can help traders understand a security\u2019s recent trading activity. However, they accomplish this goal in different ways.\n\nIn essence, the MACD works by smoothing out the security\u2019s recent price movements and comparing that medium-term trend line to a short-term trend line showing its more recent price changes. Traders can then base their buy and sell decisions on whether the short-term trend line rises above or below the medium-term trend line.\n\nRSI divergence occurs when the indicator lags behind price, while RSI reversal signals result from price lagging behind the indicator. Both divergence and reversal signals can be bullish or bearish.\n\nIn a bearish divergence, for example, price makes a higher high but the RSI makes a lower high. With a negative reversal, on the other hand, the RSI makes a higher high, while price makes a lower high.\n\nAll in all, the RSI is one of the most popular momentum oscillators in technical analysis. It is used to measure the speed and change of price movements, providing traders insights into potential overbought and oversold conditions. Calculated using a function of relative strength, the RSI ranges from 0 to 100. Indeed, the RSI, with its overbought and oversold levels, helps traders spot potential reversals, divergences, and trend continuations.\n\nJ.
