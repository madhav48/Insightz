  "definition": "Economic forecasting is the process of attempting to predict future conditions of theeconomyusing a combination ofindicators.\n\nForecasting involves the building of statistical models with inputs of several key variables, typically in an attempt to come up with a futuregross domestic product(GDP) growth rate. Primary\u00a0economic indicators include inflation, interest rates, industrial production, consumer confidence, worker productivity, retail sales, and\u00a0unemployment rates.\n\nEconomic forecasting has been around for centuries. However, it was theGreat Depression of the 1930sthat gave birth to the levels of analysis we see today.\n\nAfter that disaster, a greater onus was placed on understanding how the economy works and where it is heading. This led to the development of a richer array of statistics and analytical techniques.\n\nEconomic forecasts are geared toward predicting quarterly or annual GDP growth rates, the top-levelmacronumber upon which many businesses and governments base their decisions with respect toinvestments, hiring, spending, and other important policies that impact aggregate economic activity.\n\nBusiness managers rely on economic forecasts, using them as a guide to plan futureoperating activities.Private sectorcompanies may have in-houseeconomiststo focus on forecasts most pertinent to their specific businesses. For example, a shipping company that wants to know how much of GDP growth is driven bytrade. Alternatively, they might rely onWall Streetor academic economists, those attached tothink tanksor boutique consultants.\n\nUnderstanding what the future holds is also important for government officials, helping them to determine whichfiscalandmonetary policiesto implement. Economists employed by federal, state, or local governments play a key role in helping policymakers set spending andtaxparameters.\n\nSince politics is highly partisan, many rational people regard economic forecasts produced by governments with healthy doses of skepticism. A prime example is the long-term GDP growth forecast assumption in theU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017that projected a much smallerfiscal deficit\u2014with drastic implications to the economy\u2014than independent economists estimated.\n\nEconomic forecasting is often described as a flawed science. Many suspect that economists who work for the White House, for instance, are encouraged to produce unrealistic projections in an attempt to justify legislation.\n\nThe challenges of economic forecasting are not limited to the government. Private-sector economists, academics, and even theFederal Reserve Board(FSB) have issued economic forecasts that were wildly off the mark.\n\nIn particular, economic forecasters have a history of neglecting to foresee crises. According to Prakash Loungani, assistant director and senior personnel and budget manager\u00a0at theInternational Monetary Fund(IMF), economists failed to predict 148 of the past 150recessions.\n\nLoungani said this inability to spot imminent downturns is reflective of the pressures on forecasters to play it safe. Many, he added, prefer not to stray away from the consensus, mindful that bold projections could damage their reputations.\n\nInvestors should also not overlook the subjective nature of economic forecasting. Predictions are heavily influenced by what type of economic theory the forecaster buys into. Projections can differ considerably between, for example, one economist who believesbusiness activityis determined by thesupply of moneyand another who maintains that hefty government spending is bad for the economy.\n\nA forecaster\u2019s personal theory on how the economy works dictates the type of indicators to which they will pay more attention, potentially leading to subjective or biased projections.\n\nMany conclusions do not come from objective economic analysis. Instead, they are regularly shaped by personal beliefs on how the economy and its participants work. That inevitably means that the impact of certain policies will be judged differently.\n\nThere are a wide range of economic forecasts for 2024 given the divergent views that different experts have on the economy. One organization that makes noteworthy economic forecasts is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental forum of 38 high-income countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia, among others. Per OECD, global GDP is projected to grow at a rate of 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025\n\nEconomic forecasts are grounded in a range of important indicators, including both macroeconomic and microeconomic data. This can include everything from inflation, interest, unemployment, and productions, as well as prices for goods and services.\n\nThe most popular metric used to track economic growth is the gross domestic product (GDP). The rate at which GDP grows on a year-to-year basis is a common indicator used to measure economic growth over time.\n\nEconomic forecasting is a process by which policymakers, businesses, and individuals can predict future characteristics of the economy. Forecasting is based on an analysis of key metrics and indicators, such as unemployment, inflation, sales, consumer confidence, and more. Forecasting is vulnerable to bias and subjectivity. Therefore, economic forecasting can occasionally fail to properly judge potential economic headwinds or to accurately predict the onset of financial crises.\n\nOECD Economic Outlook. \"An Unfolding Recovery: OECD Economic Outlook, May 2024.\"",
