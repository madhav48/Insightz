  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe just-in-time\u00a0(JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that aligns raw-material orders from suppliers directly with production schedules. Companies employ this inventory strategy to increase efficiency and decrease waste by receiving goods only as they need them for\u00a0the production process, which reduces\u00a0inventory costs. This method requires producers to forecast demand accurately.\n\nThe just-in-time\u00a0(JIT) inventory systemminimizes inventory and increases efficiency. JIT production systems cut inventory costs because manufacturers receive materials and parts as needed for production and do not have to pay storage costs. Manufacturers are also not left with unwanted inventory if an order is canceled or not fulfilled.\n\nOne example of a JIT\u00a0inventory system is a car manufacturer that operates with low inventory levels but heavily relies on its supply chain to deliver the parts it requires to build cars on an as-needed basis. Consequently, the manufacturer orders the parts required to assemble the vehicles only after an order is received.\n\nFor JIT manufacturing to succeed, companies must have steady production, high-quality workmanship, glitch-free plant machinery, and reliable suppliers.\n\nThe just-in-time inventory system is different from thejust-in-casesystem, where producers hold sufficient inventories to have enough products to absorb maximum market demand.\n\nJIT inventory systems have several advantages over traditional models. Production runs are short, which means that manufacturers can quickly move from one\u00a0product to another. Also, this method reduces costs by minimizing warehouse needs. Companies also spend less money onraw materialsbecause they buy just enough resources to make the ordered products and no more.\n\nThe disadvantages of JIT inventory systems involve potential disruptions in the supply chain. If a raw-materials\u00a0supplier\u00a0has a breakdown and cannot deliver the goods promptly, this could conceivably stall the entire production line. A sudden unexpected order for goods may delay the delivery of finished products to end clients.\n\nFamous for its JIT inventory system, Toyota Motor Corporation orders parts only when it receives new car orders. Although the company installed this method in the 1970s, it took 20 years to perfect it.\n\nToyota's JIT inventory system nearly caused the company to come to a halt in February 1997, after a fire at Japanese-owned automotive parts supplier Aisin decimated its capacity to produce P-valves for Toyota's vehicles. Because Aisin is the sole supplier of this part, its weeks-long shutdown caused Toyota to halt production for several days.This caused a ripple effect, where other Toyota parts suppliers likewise had to temporarily shut down because the automaker had no need for their parts during that time period. Consequently, this fire cost Toyota 160 billion yen in revenue.\n\nAt the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ripple effect on the economy and supply chain, things like paper surgical masks, toilet paper, and hand sanitizer experienced disruption. This was because inputs from overseas factories and warehouses could not be delivered in time to meet the surge in demand caused by the pandemic.\n\nKanbanis a Japanese scheduling system that's often used in conjunction withlean manufacturingand JIT. Taiichi Ohno, an industrial engineer at Toyota, developed kanban in an effort to improve manufacturing efficiency.\n\nThe kanban system highlights problem areas by measuring lead and cycle times across the production process, which helps identify upper limits for work-in-process inventory to avoid overcapacity.\n\nA just-in-time (JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that has a company receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.\n\nA chief benefit of a JIT system is that it minimizes the need for a company to store large quantities of inventory, which improves efficiency and provides substantial cost savings. However, if there is a supply or demand shock, it can bring everything to a halt.\n\nFor instance, at the beginning of the 2020's economic crisis, everything from ventilators to surgical masks experienced disruption as inputs from overseas could not reach their destinations in time to meet a surge in demand.\n\nRetailers, restaurants, on-demand publishing, tech manufacturing, and automobile manufacturing are examples of industries that have benefited from the just-in-time inventory system.\n\nJIT is attributed to the Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corporation. Executives at Toyota in the 1970s reasoned that the company could adapt more quickly and efficiently to changes in trends or demands for model changes if it did not keep any more inventory than was immediately needed.\n\nThe just-in-time\u00a0(JIT) inventory system is a management strategy that minimizes inventory and increases efficiency. It's popular withsmall businesses and major corporations alikebecause it enhances cash flow and reduces the capital needed to run the business. However, if there's a disruption in the supply chain, the system might fail to get things done on time.\n\nToyota. \u201cToyota Production System.\" Page 1-2.\n\nIBM. \u201cSupporting Lean Manufacturing Principles with IBM Maximo Asset Management.\u201d Page 15.\n\nMotorola. \u201cAnnual Report 1986.\u201d Page 3.\n\nToyota. \u201cToyota Production System.\u201d Pages 1-2.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \"Toyota Motor Shows Its Mettle After Fire Destroys Part Plant.\"\n\nNishiguchi, Toshihiro, and Alexandre Beaudet. \u201cThe Toyota Group and the Aisin Fire.\u201dSloan Management Review, vol. 40, no 1, Fall 1998, p. 51.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology. \"Self-Organization and Clustered Control in the Toyota Group: Lessons From the Aisin Fire.\" Pages 7\u20139.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cUnderstanding Supply and Demand Shocks Amid Coronavirus.\u201d\n\nDSpace JSPUI. \"Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production.\" Pages 19-20.\n\nDSpace JSPUI. \"Toyota Production System: Beyond Large-Scale Production.\u201d Pages 20-23.",
