The process is sometimes called significance testing,\n\nHypothesis testing begins when a researcher observes a pattern in a set of data. The test determines whether the pattern can be explained by coincidence or other variables.\n\nThe methodology used depends on the nature of the data and the reason for the analysis.\n\nIn hypothesis testing, ananalysttests a statistical sample, intending to provide evidence on the plausibility of the\u00a0null hypothesis. Statistical analysts measure and examine a random sample of the population being analyzed. All analysts use a random population sample to test two different hypotheses: thenull hypothesisand the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe null hypothesis is usually a hypothesis of equality between population parameters; e.g., a null hypothesis may state that the population mean return is equal to zero. The alternative hypothesis is effectively the opposite of a null hypothesis. Thus, they aremutually exclusive, and only one can be true. However, one of the two hypotheses will always be true.\n\nThe null hypothesis is a statement about the data that is assumed to be true.\n\nThe steps in hypothesis testing are:\n\nIf a researcher wants to test if a penny is fair, the null hypothesis would state that the probability of landing on heads is exactly 50%. The alternative hypothesis would assert that the probability of landing on heads is not 50%. Mathematically, these would be represented as follows:\n\nA random sample of 100 coin flips is taken, and the results are recorded. If it is found that the outcomes were 40 heads and 60 tails, the analyst might infer that the penny does not have a 50% chance of landing on heads.\n\nFurther statistical testing, such asp-testing, might be performed to determine the likelihood of a fair coin landing heads up 40 times out of 100. If that likelihood is very low, the researcher would reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis.\n\nIf there were 48 heads and 52 tails, then it is plausible that the coin could be fair and still produce such a result. When the null hypothesis is \"accepted,\" the analyst states that the difference between the expected results (50 heads and 50 tails) and the observed results (48 heads and 52 tails) is \"explainable by chance alone.\"\n\nWhen scientists and researchers notice patterns in data, they need a way to make sure those patterns cannot be explained by coincidence or other variables. Hypothesis testing is a way of comparing different theories to find the best explanation for a pattern.\n\nTo perform hypothesis testing, the researcher lists different hypotheses about the relationships between the data they are looking at. Then they make a series of observations. The theory that does the best job of explaining their observations is considered the strongest hypothesis.\n\nSome statisticians attribute the first hypothesis tests to satirical writer John Arbuthnot in 1710, who studied male and female births in England after observing that in nearly every year, male births exceeded female births by a slight proportion. Arbuthnot calculated that the probability of this happening by chance was small, and therefore it was due to \u201cdivine providence.\u201d\n\nHypothesis testing helps assess the accuracy of new ideas or theories by testing them against data. This allows researchers to determine whether the evidence supports their hypothesis, helping to avoid false claims and conclusions. Hypothesis testing also provides a framework for decision-making based on data rather than personal opinions or biases. By relying on statistical analysis, hypothesis testing helps to reduce the effects of chance and confounding variables, providing a robust framework for making informed conclusions.\n\nHypothesis testing relies exclusively on data and doesn\u2019t provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject being studied. Additionally, the accuracy of the results depends on the quality of the available data and the statistical methods used. Inaccurate data or inappropriate hypothesis formulation may lead to incorrect conclusions or failed tests.\n\nHypothesis testing can also lead to errors, such as analysts either accepting or rejecting a null hypothesis when they shouldn\u2019t have. These errors may result in false conclusions or missed opportunities to identify significant patterns or relationships in the data.\n\nHypothesis testing is a statistical process that helps researchers determine the strength of a hypothesis. By using a well-formulated hypothesis and set of statistical tests, individuals or businesses can make inferences about the population that they are studying and draw conclusions based on the data presented.\n\nAll hypothesis testing methods have the same four-step process, which includes stating the hypotheses, formulating an analysis plan, analyzing the sample data, and interpreting the results.\n\nSage. \"Introduction to Hypothesis Testing,\" Page 4.\n\nElder Research. \"Who Invented the Null Hypothesis?\"\n\nFormplus. \"Hypothesis Testing: Definition, Uses, Limitations and Examples.\"",
