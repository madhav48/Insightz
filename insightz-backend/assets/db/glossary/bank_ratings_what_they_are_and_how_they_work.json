  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA bank rating refers to a letter or numerical grade assigned to banks and thrift institutions by rating agencies.\n\nGrades are assigned to provide the public with information about an organization's level of credit risk and financial safety and soundness. They also help bank leaders identify problems within their institution, if any, that need to be addressed.\n\nMany rating agencies use a proprietary formula to determine ratings while others use theCAMELS systemto assess financial institutions.\n\nRegulatory andcredit ratingagencies assign ratings to banks in order to provide the public with information about the safety and soundness of a financial institution or its risk of default on debt obligations.\n\nThese ratings are issued by regulatory bodies, such as theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and credit rating agencies likeStandard & Poor's (S&P),Moody's, andFitch. Ratings are updated on a regular basis by bank supervisors, normally every quarter.\n\nRatings give consumers insight into the health and stability offinancial institutions, such as banks and otherthrift institutions.\n\nThese rankings are also provided to the bank's management team and its board to address any problems, if any. Grades can be based on a series of factors, including the capital amounts,liquidity,asset quality, and the capability of management.\n\nAgencies may use different ratings system. They may consider the workings of such systems proprietary and maintain confidentiality about how ratings are derived.\n\nThe FDIC is an independent government agency that protects depositors' money in FDIC-insured banks up to a certain amount in the event that a financial institution fails. It regularly examines financial institutions to ensure financial safety and soundness.\n\nIts ratings are different from those provided by credit rating agencies, which focus on the ability of financial institutions and corporations to pay debt obligations on time.\n\nFor instance, the FDIC presents ratings related to the level of consumer compliance (with consumer protection and civil rights statutes/regulations) that it finds at each federally regulated commercial bank, savings and loan association, mutual savings bank and credit union.\n\nIt also provides ratings relating to the safety and soundness of these financial institutions.\n\nGovernment regulators assign ratings based on the CAMELS system, which is used worldwide to provide guidance about the financial soundness of financial institutions. The letters in the acronym CAMELS stand for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity.\n\nThe FDIC Safety and Soundness ratings use a scale of 1 to 5, where:\n\nBank customers and investors can visit acredit rating agencysite to learn about its ratings structure and the meaning of its individual ratings.\n\nFor example, Fitch rates banks with letters and numbers. In September 2022, it assigned Bank of America Corporation a rating of AA- for the category of Long-Term Issuer Default and an F1+ rating for the category of Short-Term Issuer Default.\n\nAccording to Fitch, \"AA ratings denote expectations of very low default risk. They indicate very strong capacity for payment of financial commitments. This capacity is not significantly vulnerable to foreseeable events.\"\n\nThe F1+ rating indicates the lowest default risk and the greatest ability to meet timely payments of financial obligations to financial institutions in the same country. Fitch appends the \"+\" sign when a bank's liquidity is particularly strong.\n\nBecause no rating service is identical or infallible, investors and clients should consult multiple ratings and financial metrics when analyzing their financial institutions.\n\nAs stated above, many agencies use CAMELS or similar criteria to rate banks. Here is what the CAMELS system helps agencies examine.\n\nCapital adequacy refers to the amount of cash held in reserve by financial institutions compared to what authorities require them to hold. Institutions must also address guidelines and regulatory policies related to interest and dividends.\n\nThis entails an evaluation ofcredit riskassociated with a bank\u2019s interest-bearing assets, such as loans. Rating organizations may also look at whether a bank\u2019sportfoliois appropriately diversified. They may look for policies that limit credit risk and support the efficiency of operations.\n\nBy reviewing the management team, an agency wants to examine whether a bank's leaders understand the direction of the institution and have specific plans to move forward in a given regulatory environment. Visualizing what is possible, placing a bank in context with industrytrends, and takingrisksto grow the business are all required of strong leaders.\n\nBankfinancial statementsare often harder to decipher than those of other companies, given their distinct business models. Banks take deposits from savers and pay interest on some of these accounts.\n\nTo generaterevenues, they will take deposits, loan them to borrowers, and receive interest on them. Their profits are derived from the spread between the rate they pay for funds and the rate they receive from borrowers.\n\nRatings take into account liquidity, or a bank having enough assets of a type that can be converted to cash quickly and easily so that short-term financial obligations can be met. Those obligations include withdrawals by customers.\n\nSensitivity refers to an institution's risk exposure, for instance market risk. For example, a regulator may examine how a bank monitors its credit concentrations and the industries to which it lends money.\n\nCredit ratings important and useful because they indicate the credit risk that potential investors in the debt issued by an institution may face. Credit ratings project how likely it is that bond investors will be repaid in full and on time for their loans.\n\nRatings are a forward-looking opinion rendered by rating agencies based on a close examination of a financial institution. As a consequence, there's no guarantee that a financial institution with an excellent rating won't default. That's why ratings should be just one of a variety of indicators of financial soundness that investors take into account before making investments.\n\nImportantly, they can be a source of information and transparency for consumers and investors. Credit ratings are vital to healthy and efficient capital markets. Along with other important financial data, they can provide investors with the confidence to invest, which in the long run can mean ongoing and vital economic activity and wealth building.\n\nBank ratings are grades related to aspects of financial institution safety and soundness assigned by government agencies or private rating agencies.\n\nThey are produced to ensure that the public has adequate and clear information about the financial institutions that they may open accounts with, invest in, or lend to.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"The ABCs of CAMELS.\"\n\nFDIC. \"Composite Ratings Definition List.\"\n\nFitchRatings. \"Bank of America Corporation.\"\n\nFitchRatings. \"Issuer Default Ratings: AA.\"\n\nFitchRatings. \"National Short-Term Credit Ratings: F1.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Bank Capital Requirements: A Primer and Policy Issues.\"",
