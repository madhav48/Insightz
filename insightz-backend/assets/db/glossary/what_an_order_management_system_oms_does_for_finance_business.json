  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn order management system (OMS) is an electronic system developed to executesecuritiesorders in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Brokers and dealers use an OMS when filling orders for various types of securities and can track the progress of each order throughout the system.\n\nAn OMS in the financial markets may also be referred to as a trade order management system.\n\nBusinesses\u2014e-commercebusinesses and sellers in particular\u2014also use an OMS to streamline and automate the sales and fulfillment process from thepoint of saleto delivery to the customer.\n\nAn OMS\u00a0is a software system that facilitates and manages the execution of trade orders. In the financial markets, an order must be placed in a trading system to execute a buy or sell order for a security.\n\nAtrading ordertypically contains the following information:\n\nAn OMS\u00a0executes trades through a software system using theFinancial Information eXchange (FIX)protocol. FIX is an electronic communications protocol used to share international real-time exchange\u00a0information related to the trillions of dollars of securities transactions in circulation in markets.\n\nHowever, communicating transactions can also be done through the use of a customapplication programming interface (API). The FIX protocol linkshedge fundsand investment firms to hundreds of counterparties around the world using the OMS.\n\nAmong institutional trading desks, an OMS can be used on both the buy-side and the sell-side to allow firms to manage the life cycle of their trades\u00a0and automate and streamline investments across their portfolios.\n\nFor review, thebuy-sideis a segment of Wall Street made up of investing institutions such as\u00a0mutual funds,\u00a0pension funds,\u00a0andinsurance firmsthat tend to buy large portions of securities for money management purposes.\n\nThe buy-side is the opposite of thesell-side. The sell-side involves the creation and selling of securities, and the firms that facilitate those activities. This would include corporations selling stock to raise capital, investment banks that facilitate that process, advisors, and broker-dealers, who sell securities.\n\nTogether, the buy-side and\u00a0the sell-side\u00a0comprise both sides of Wall Street.\n\nThere are many products and securities that can be traded or monitored with an OMS. Some of the financial instruments traded by using an OMS include:\n\nTypically, only exchange members can connect directly to an exchange, which means that a sell-side OMS usually has exchange connectivity, whereas a buy-side\u00a0OMS is concerned with connecting to sell-side firms. When an order is executed on the sell-side, the sell-side OMS must then update its state and send an execution report to the order\u2019s originating firm.\n\nA trading OMS will often route orders to the best exchange in terms of price and execution or will allow a trader tomanually routewhich exchange to send the order to.\n\nAn OMS should also allow firms to access information on orders entered into the system, including details on allopen orders, and\u00a0previously completed orders. The OMS supports portfolio management by translating intended asset allocation actions into marketable orders for the buy-side.\n\nMany OMSs offer real-time trading solutions, which allow users to monitor market prices and execute orders in multiple exchanges across all markets instantaneously by real-time price streaming. Some of the benefits that firms can achieve from an OMS include managing orders andasset allocationof portfolios.\n\nAn effective OMS is critical in helping with regulatory compliance, including real-time checks of trades both before and after entry. OMSs help compliance officers with tracking the life cycle of trades to determine if there\u2019s any illicit activity or financial fraud, as well as any regulatory breaches by an employee of the firm. An OMS can improve workflow and communication among portfolio managers, traders, and compliance officers.\n\nOMSs are an important development in the financial services industry because of the real-time monitoring of positions, the ability to prevent regulatory violations, the speed and accuracy of trade execution, and the significant cost savings that result.\n\nIn addition to a trading OMS, there are several other contexts for order management. Businesses can use an OMS to keep track of customer orders from point of sale to delivery and to take care of returns and refunds. This is especially useful for businesses that have a high volume of sales or rely on shipping via e-commerce.\n\nFor people who have online stores or conduct e-commerce on sites likeAmazon or eBay, having an OMS in place can greatly aid in reducing errors, saving time, and increasing profitability. There are severalturnkeyOMS platforms that easily integrate with these and other online marketplaces.\n\nTherefore, choosing an OMS will depend on the type, size, and scope of the business involved. Costlier systems will also have more features and abilities, such as taking order payments in a variety of currencies, routing suppliers and warehouses based on location or proximity, tracking customer order status, and forecasting inventory status to anticipate possible shortages of supply, invoicing, and returns/exchanges.\n\nAn OMS helps traders enter and execute orders, from the simple to the complex, more efficiently. This lowers transaction costs, helps gainbest execution, and reduces errors. It also reportsfills, books trades, and updates one\u2019s positions or portfolio. Some OMSs can also automate trading strategies or risk-mitigating measures such asstop-lossesandtrailing stops.\n\nBusinesses benefit from an OMS by streamlining the order fulfillment process. This can manage everything from point of sale to delivery. E-commerce sellers can especially benefit from an OMS that can automate logistics, shipment, returns, and interface with platforms like Amazon, eBay, or AliExpress.\n\nFor businesses, an order management system is a digital way of tracking an order from the order entry to its completion. An order management system will record all the information and processes that occur through an order's life cycle. This includes order entry, pathways, inventory management, order completion, and after-order follow-up/services.\n\nAn order management system (OMS) is an electronic system designed to execute securities trades in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Brokers and dealers use an OMS when filling orders for various types of securities and can track the progress of each order throughout the system. These also may also be referred to as a trade order management system in the financial markets.",
