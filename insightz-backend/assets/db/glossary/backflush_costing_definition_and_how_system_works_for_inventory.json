  "term": "Backflush Costing: Definition and How System Works for Inventory",
  "definition": "Backflush costing is a product costing system generally used in ajust-in-time(JIT) inventory system. In short, it is an accounting method that records the costs associated with producing a good or service only after they are produced, completed, or sold. Backflush costing is also commonly referred to as backflush accounting.\n\n\u201cFlushing\u201d costs to the end of the production run eliminates the detailed tracking of expenses, such asraw materialand labor costs, throughout the manufacturing process, which is a feature of traditional costing systems. This allows the company to simplify its expense tracking processes, thus saving accounting and process costs, but it may also limit the detail of information that the company retains related to individual costs for production and sales.\n\nThe total costs of a production run are recorded all at once, at the end of the process. Companies using backflush costing, therefore, primarily work backward, calculating the costs of products after they're sold, finished, or shipped. To do this, businesses assign standard charges to the goods they produce. Sometimes costs differ, so companies eventually need to recognize the\u00a0variances\u00a0in standard costs and actual costs.\n\nUsually, the costs of products are calculated during various stages of the production cycle. By eliminating work-in-process (WIP) accounts, backflush costing is designed to simplify the accounting process and save businesses money.\n\nIn theory, backflushing appears to be a sensible way to avoid the many complexities associated with assigning costs to products and inventory. Not logging costs during the various production stages enable companies to save time and reduce their expenses. Companies looking for ways to reduce their bottom lines may use backflush costing, but it isn't always an easy accounting method to implement.\n\nThe process of backflush costing makes it difficult for companies to audit because it doesn't always adhere to the basic fundamentals of accounting.\n\nHowever, backflushing can also be challenging to implement and is not an option available to all companies. Moreover, there are some other big caveats: businesses that do backflush costing lack a sequential\u00a0audit trail and may not always conform to\u00a0generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nCompanies using backflush costing generally meet the following three conditions:",
