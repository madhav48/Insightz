  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA homestead exemption is a legal provision that shields a home from some creditors following the death of a homeowner\u2019s spouse or the declaration ofbankruptcyand minimizesproperty taxesfor homeowners.\n\nThe Homestead Act, enacted during the Civil War in 1862, accelerated the settlement of the western territory. It allowed any adult citizen or intended citizen, who had never borne arms against the U.S. government, to claim 160 acres of surveyed government land. Claimants had to live on and cultivate the land.\n\nAdditional homesteading laws were passed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The\u00a0Federal Land Policy and Management Act\u00a0of 1976 ended homesteading, except for\u00a0Alaska, which allowed homesteading until 1986.\n\nThe homestead tax exemption can provide surviving spouses with ongoing property tax relief on a graduated scale so homes with lowerassessed valuesbenefit the most. The homestead exemption is designed to offer both physical shelter and financial protection, blocking the forced sale of aprimary residence.\n\nIndividuals may apply for a homestead property tax exemption if they have a primary residence and want to reduce the overall property tax bill associated with that residence. Some states offer the exemption to every homeowner, while others require individuals to meet certain criteria such as:\n\nThe homestead exemption doesn\u2019t prevent or stop a bank foreclosure if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage.\n\nSome homestead exemptions are based on a flat reduction of all of the taxable value of your home. A percentage calculates other homestead property tax exemptions. Lower-valued homes receive a larger reduction using the first method. The latter is a better choice for people with high-value properties.\n\nA version of the homestead exemption provision is found in every state or territory with some exceptions, such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. However, how theexemptionis applied and how much protection it affords against creditors varies by state. The homestead exemption is an automatic benefit in some states, but homeowners must file a claim with the state to receive it in others.\n\nA few states, including Florida and Texas, afford unlimited financial protection against unsecured creditors for the home, although acreage limits may apply for the protected property. A limit for protection from creditors can range from $5,000 to $550,000, depending on the state.\n\nThe protection limits are not for the home\u2019s value but for the homeowner\u2019sequity. A homeowner can\u2019t be forced to sell the property to benefit creditors if the equity held is less than the limit, but creditors may force the sale If a homestead\u2019s equity exceeds the limits.\n\nProtection doesn\u2019t apply to secured creditors, such as the bank that holds themortgage. The homeowner is protected only fromunsecured creditorswho may come after the home\u2019s value to satisfy claims against the homeowner\u2019s assets.\n\nFederal bankruptcy law shields a home from sale if the owner\u2019s equity does not exceed $25,150 if the bankruptcy case was filed after April 1, 2019.Homeowners commonly use the state\u2019s limits, which often prove more favorable.\n\nThose who declare bankruptcy in New Jersey or Pennsylvania can get protection using the federal limits despite the absence of a state homestead exemption in these states. But bankruptcy protection only protects against unsecured creditors. It won\u2019t prevent a bank that holds a mortgage from foreclosing on the home.\n\nA homestead tax or property tax is typically applied to homes based on the assessed value by the local government tax assessor\u2019s office. The homestead tax can be a percentage of the property\u2019s value or a fixed amount. The homestead exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on state laws.\n\nHomestead tax exemptions usually offer a fixed discount on taxes, such as exempting the first $50,000 of the\u00a0assessed\u00a0value with the remainder taxed at the normal rate. With a $50,000 homestead exemption,\u00a0a\u00a0home valued at $150,000 would be taxed on only $100,000 of assessed value. A home valued at $75,000 would be taxed on only $25,000.\n\nFixed homestead\u00a0tax exemptions create aprogressive taxthat\u2019s more favorable for those with modest homes. The exemption is paid for with a local or state sales tax in some areas.\n\nHomeowners must occupy the property as their permanent residence to qualify for a homestead exemption.\n\nA county or local tax assessor\u2019s website or office will provide details on available homestead tax exemptions. Some states require an application, available online, and have deadlines.\n\nMost states have homestead exemptions except New Jersey\u00a0and Pennsylvania. Some states have other homestead laws such as provisions that protect surviving spouses from creditors.\n\nThe homestead exemption provides an exemption from property taxes on a primary residence and protects the value from\u00a0creditors, and circumstances that arise from the death of the homeowner\u2019s spouse. The exemption can\u2019t be claimed for another property elsewhere. Homestead protection is automatic in some states, but homeowners must file a claim for a homestead exemption in others.\n\nNational Archives. \u201cHomestead Act (1862).\u201d\n\nWorld Population Review. \u201cHomestead Exemptions by State 2024.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cHomestead Exemptions in Bankruptcy After the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005 (BAPCPA),\u201d Pages 3 and 18.\n\nNational Bankruptcy Forum. \u201cWhat Is a Homestead Exemption?
