  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nErika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA money center bank is similar in structure to a standard bank; however, it's borrowing, and lending activities are with governments, largecorporations, and regular banks. These types of financial institutions (or designated branches of these institutions) generally do not borrow from or lend to consumers.\n\nMoney center banks are usually located in major economic centers such as London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York. With their largebalance sheets, these banks are involved in national, and internationalfinancial systems.\n\nFour examples of large money center banks in the United States include Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo, among others. During the2008 financial crisis, these banks struggled financially; however, the U.S. Federal Reserve stepped in with three phases ofquantitative easing(QE) and bought backmortgages.\n\nIn 2004, U.S. homeownership peaked at 70%; during the last quarter of 2005, home prices started to fall, which led to a 40% decline in the U.S. Home Construction Index during 2006. At this point, subprime borrowers were not able to withstand the higher interest rates and began defaulting on their loans. In 2007, multiplesubprime lenderswere filing forbankruptcy. This had a ripple effect throughout the entire U.S. financial services industry\u2014of course, hitting many money center banks hard.\n\nDuring the period of QE,\u00a0these financial institutions had a steady stream of cash, with which they were able to originate new mortgages and loans, supporting overall economic recovery.\n\nOnce the QE programs ceased, many were concerned that money center banks would not be able to grow organically without support. This is because the banks' primary sources of income were loan and mortgage interest charges. However, U.S.interest ratesdid begin to rise, and with them, money center banks\u2019net interest incomealso rose.\n\nMost money center banks raise funds from domestic and international money marks (as opposed to\u00a0relying on depositors, like traditional banks). Thedividend yieldsof these institutions are enviable for some, who like to collect such securities for income.\n\nThe formula for calculating dividend yield is as follows:\n\n\ufeff=Annual\u00a0Dividends\u00a0Per\u00a0SharePrice\u00a0Per\u00a0Share\\displaystyle{=\\ \\frac{\\text{Annual Dividends Per Share}}{\\text{Price Per Share}}}=Price\u00a0Per\u00a0ShareAnnual\u00a0Dividends\u00a0Per\u00a0Share\u200b\ufeff\n\nEstimated current year yields often use the previous year\u2019s dividend yield or take the latestquarterlyyield, and then multiply this by four (adjusting forseasonality)\u00a0and divide it by the current share price.\n\nQuarterly rates of return are often annualized for comparative purposes. A stock or bond might return 5% in Q1. We could annualize the return by multiplying 5% by the number of periods or quarters in a year. The investment would have anannualized returnof 20% because there are four quarters in one year or (5% * 4 = 20%).",
