  "term": "Underwriting Spread: Meaning, Overview, Example",
  "definition": "An underwriting spread is the difference between the dollar\u00a0amount thatunderwriters, such as investment banks, pay an issuing company for its securities and the dollar amount that underwriters receive from selling the securities in a public offering.\u00a0The underwriting spread is essentially the investment bank'sgross\u00a0profit margin, typically disclosed as a percentage or in points-per-unit-of-sale.\n\nThe size of underwriting spreads is determined on a deal-by-deal basis and is influenced mainly by the underwriter's perceived risk in the deal. This will also be influenced by expectations for the demand of the securities in the market.\n\nThe size of theunderwritingspread depends on the negotiations and competitive bidding among members of anunderwriter\u00a0syndicateand the issuing\u00a0company itself. The spread increases as the risks involved with the issuance increase.\n\nThe underwriting spread for aninitial public offering (IPO)usually includes the following components:\n\nThe manager is\u00a0usually entitled to the whole underwriting spread. Each\u00a0member of the underwriting syndicate then gets a (not necessarily equal) share of the\u00a0underwriting fee and a portion of the concession. Additionally, a broker-dealer, which is not itself a member of the underwriter\u00a0syndicate,\u00a0earns a share of the\u00a0concession based on how well it does selling the issue.\n\nThe value of an underwriting spread\u00a0can be influenced by variables such as the size of the issue, risk, andvolatility.\n\nProportionately,\u00a0the\u00a0concession increases\u00a0as total underwriting fees rise. Meanwhile,\u00a0the management and underwriting fees decrease with gross underwriting fees.\u00a0The effect of size on the division of fees is usually due to\u00a0differential economies of scale. The extent of investment banker work, for example,\u00a0in writing theprospectusand preparing the roadshow,\u00a0is somewhat fixed, while the amount of sales work is not. Larger deals will not involve exponentially more investment banker work.\n\nHowever, it might involve much more sales effort, requiring an increase in the proportion of the selling concession. Alternatively, junior banks may\u00a0join a syndicate, even if they receive a smaller share of the fees in the form of a lower selling concession.\n\nTo illustrate an underwriting spread, consider a company that\u00a0receives $36 per share from the underwriter for its shares. If the underwriters turn around and\u00a0sell the stock to the public at $38 per share, the underwriting spread\u00a0would be $2 per share.",
