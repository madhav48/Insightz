  "term": "What Is a Limited Government, and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA limited government is one where legalized force is restricted through delegated and enumerated authorities. Countries with limited governments have fewer laws about what individuals and businesses can and cannot do. In many countries, a written constitution is used to spell out the powers and limitations of government.\n\nThe opposite of a limited government is an interventionist or authoritarian government. In reality, most countries\u2014even those with otherwise high degrees of freedom and liberty\u2014operate with some amount of government control and intervention.\n\nThe theory of limited government can be traced back to the Enlightenment philosophers of the 17th century, but the idea itself is much older. It is also associated with thefree marketandclassical liberalism, although politicians and economists differ on the exact limitations that a government should have.\n\nIn its basic form, a limited government is one whose main function is the protection of people and their property, and it levies just enough taxes to finance services related to these purposes. According to this interpretation, a limited government might tax the population to pay for police or national defense, but it would not concern itself with the beliefs or moral behavior of its citizens.\n\nAnother interpretation defines a limited government as one that exercises only the specifically named powers that its constitution assigns to it. It can also be characterized by aseparation of powersand a system ofchecks and balances. For example, the U.S. government is restricted to exercising the specifically named powers that the Constitution assigns to it.\n\nLimited government, in\u00a0its modern conception, originated out of the classical liberal tradition in Europe. This tradition emphasized therights of the individual, in contrast to the monarchies and theocratic governments that dominated Europe at that time.\n\nThe Magna Carta, drafted in the year 1215, is one of the earliest written descriptions of a limited government. The document limited the reach of the English king\u2019s power by giving the country\u2019s nobility the rights that they could exercise over the throne. However, the document only protected a small part of what is today the United Kingdom.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution, written in 1787, extended the idea of a limited government by separating the powers of state and federal governments. It also segmented the federal government into three branches: legislative, judicial, and executive. This is intended to make it difficult for any single person or interest group to control the entirety of government power in the United States.\n\nIn addition, the Bill of Rights\u2014the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution, ratified in 1791\u2014enumerates certain prohibitions that apply to the government. These rights further limit the federal government by prohibiting certain uses of government power.\n\nWhile limited government is frequently associated with the free market, the terms are not interchangeable. There have been many instances of authoritarian governments that were friendly to business interests.\n\nIn economic policy, limited governments seek minimal interventions in trade or commercial activity. They are often associated with concepts such aslaissez-faireeconomics, as first delineated in Adam Smith\u2019s 1776 book titled \u201cAn Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations.\u201d In this context, the most extreme sort of limited government would be one that letssupply and demanddrive theeconomy: The government would not intervene to set prices or influence business activity.\n\nProponents of this view believe that limited government can facilitate economic growth\u00a0and prosperity by minimizing restrictions on commercial activity. This view\u2014later associated with theAustrian school of economics\u2014holds that government interventions in the economy can distort markets and reduce competition, resulting in shortages or high prices.\n\nCritics of this view believe that the government has an obligation to intervene in the economy, either to support certain industries or reduce wealth inequality. In contemporary economics, this view is frequently associated withJohn Maynard Keynes, who argued that government spending can actually stimulate economic activity.\n\nWhile many contemporary political thinkers agree that government powers should be constrained, there is considerable disagreement on the exact limitations that government power should have. Many critics argue that government has the ability or obligation to solve collective action problems that cannot be solved by market forces alone.\n\nA common example is the environmentalregulationsthat punish businesses for polluting the air or water. Although individuals can pursue polluting industries through the court system, this solution is out of reach for many potential victims\u2014particularly those who are excluded from the legal system. Instead, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is expected to penalize these industries on behalf of the public.\n\nAnother is the protection of key industries. Many governments usesubsidiesortariffsto support domestic agriculture or manufacturing, even though prices would be cheaper on the world market.\n\nAlthough protectionism sometimes works on behalf of political interest groups, it can also supportindustrieswith a strategic or security value. According to this reasoning, the cost of supporting these industries is lower than the cost ofnothaving them\u2014particularly in the event of a major crisis, such as a war or famine.\n\nIt is also possible for a government to be too small. In colloquial usage, the phrase \u201climited government\u201d is often used interchangeably with \u201csmall government\u201d\u2014the idea that governments should impose as few taxes as possible and employ a minimum number of administrators. While these ideas are closely connected, a small government may not necessarily have the resources to protect public interests.\n\nFor example, consider a hypothetical country whose taxes are not high enough to pay administrators a competitive salary. To make a living, some administrators might resort tograft or bribery, thereby imposing an even greater economic burden than that of taxation.\n\nIn fact, research by The World Bank confirms that public-sector salaries play a large part in anti-corruption measures. Based on country data, the organization concluded that increasing wages could reduce corruption in certain situations when paired with appropriate policies.\n\nThe phrase \u201climited government\u201d appears to have originated during the reign of James VI and I, king of Scotland, England, and Ireland.\n\nSince 1996, the Fraser Institute\u2014a Canadian research and educational organization\u2014has produced annual reports ranking countries in terms of how much their policies and institutions are supportive of economic freedom.\n\nIt measures limited government by the size of government (topmarginal tax rates, public spending), the legal system (protection of property rights, judicial independence), sound money (inflation), freedom to trade internationally (tariffs, trade barriers), and regulation of credit markets, labor markets, and businesses.\n\nThe following rankings come from the Fraser Institute\u2019s \u201c2024Economic Freedom of the World Index\u201d report (\u201cFraser Index\u201d), which analyzes 165 countries and territories. The 2024 rankings are assessed based on 2022 information.\n\nTechnically an autonomous region of China, Hong Kong was nevertheless ranked first in the 2024 Fraser Index. Hong Kong has usually been in the top spot in the Fraser Index due to favorable taxes, freedom to trade internationally, and favorable labor and business market regulations.\n\nHong Kong ranks first despite the security law imposed by China in 2021. The government\u2019s laws \u201cimposed new and significant barriers to entry, limits on the employment of foreign labor, and increases in the cost of doing business.\u201d The decline in Hong Kong has been larger than the world\u2019s average decline.\n\nAlthough it was ranked 67th in terms of economic freedom, the Fraser Index ranked Honduras second in size of government\u2014just behind neighboring Guatemala. Honduras had a high score for transfers and subsidies, government investment, and foreign currency bank accounts, balancing out low scores for its legal system.\n\nAccording to the Fraser rankings, New Zealand was the fourth-freest economy in the world, though it ranked 97th in terms of size of government. The country earned high marks for its legal system and property rights, sound money, and freedom to trade internationally. However, the country scored lower in size of government, largely due to government spending and subsidies.\n\nFederalism refers to a political system that delegates certain powers to local or provincial bodies. In a federalist system, local governments may have their own legislature, courts, tax authority, and other functions of government. In some cases, they may also have the power to secede from the central government.\n\nIn the United States, the Constitution divides the government into three separate branches, with separate powers and constraints. All three must work together to enact new policies and laws. At the time the Constitution was written, it was considered unlikely that any one person or faction could control all three branches. Therefore, this separation was considered a way of preventing government overreach.\n\nWhile the concept of limited government dates back to the Magna Carta, the idea was further developed by Enlightenment thinkers in the 17th and 18th centuries. The idea that government power requires theconsent of the governedoriginates fromJohn Locke.\n\nThe concept of separating the government into three branches is attributed to Baron de Montesquieu, and the idea that the government should avoid intervening in commerce is frequently attributed toAdam Smith. Many of these ideas were later integrated into the American and French Revolutions.\n\nAccording to the annual Human Freedom Index Report for 2024, co-published by the Cato Institute and the Fraser Institute, the highest-scoring country in terms of limited government was Switzerland. The top 10 are:\n\nThe concept of limited government holds that there should be legal constraints on the power of political authorities, especially with respect to individual rights. The concept is also important in economic affairs, where government intervention may have the effect of disrupting markets and commerce.\n\nU.K. Parliament. \u201cMagna Carta.\u201d\n\nThe White House, Biden Administration Archives. \u201cThe Constitution.\u201d\n\nNational Archives. \u201cThe Bill of Rights: What Does It Say?\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cWhat Is Capitalism?\u201d\n\nThe World Bank. \u201cEffects Of Public Sector Wages on Corruption.\u201d Page 2.\n\nFraser Institute. \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\u201d\n\nFraser Institute. \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\u201d Page 21.\n\nFraser Institute. \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World: 2023 Annual Report.\u201d Pages VII and 10.\n\nFraser Institute. \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\u201d Pages 17 and 20.\n\nFraser Institute. \u201cEconomic Freedom of the World: 2024 Annual Report.\u201d Pages 4, 16, 17, and 22.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \u201cFederalism.\u201d\n\nEncyclop\u0153dia Britannica. \u201cJohn Locke.\u201d\n\nEncyclop\u0153dia Britannica. \u201cMontesquieu.\u201d\n\nCato Institute. \u201cThe Human Freedom Index 2024.\u201d Page 5.",
