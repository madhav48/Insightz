  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nBest practices are a set of guidelines, ethics, or ideas that represent the most efficient or prudent course of action in a given business situation.\n\nBest practices may be established by authorities, such as regulators, self-regulatory organizations (SROs), or other governing bodies, or they may be internally decreed by a company's management team.\n\nBest practices serve as a general framework for a variety of situations. For instance, in businesses that produce physical products, best practices that highlight efficient ways to complete tasks might be given to employees. Best practices lists may also outline safety procedures in order to minimize employee injuries.\n\nFor corporateaccountants, thegenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP) represent best practices. GAAP is a common set of accounting standards which aim to improve the clarity, consistency, and comparability of the communication of financial information.\n\nGAAP facilitates the cross-comparison of financial information across different companies within the same sector. This benefits investors and the companies they invest in by promoting transparency.\n\nInvestment managersmay follow best practices when handling a client's money by prudently investing in a well-diversified portfolio and adhering to a client's risk tolerances, time horizons, and retirement goals.\n\nCorporate governanceor acode of ethicscan serve as best practices for an organization.\n\n\"Best practices\" is a term that can be applied broadly and across a swath of industries. In the world of business, the phrase is used in connection with everything from project management to audit functions to explain the most efficient method of completing a business task.\n\nWith the advent of newer quality control systems came the need for a way to apply measurable benchmarks and communicate ways to rapidly implement new standards of excellence across an organization. This is done by identifying problems, quantifying their frequencies, cultivating solutions, and monitoring the execution of those solutions to ensure they solve the issues at hand.\n\nBest practices can also be used as abenchmarkwhere one company can share actionable solutions with other organizations. Say there's a firm well-known for its best-in-class product distribution infrastructure. When asked to precisely describe the best practices that led to their hyper-efficiency, the company reveals that it outfits all fulfillment staffers with red markers that they may use to sign off on their highest priority deliveries.\n\nConsequently, all red ink orders are given higher levels of scrutiny than others. As more eyes reflexively search for errors when they see red ink, more mistakes can be flagged and corrected.\n\nAlthough companies share their best practices as a matter of routine, revealing trade secrets that might be easily replicated by the competition would be unwise.\n\nHere are eight steps for developing best practices:\n\nJust in time(JIT) is a best practices solution focused on inventory that seeks to align materials ordered from suppliers to a production schedule. The goal of JIT is to ensure efficiency and reduce waste by only receiving materials when needed. While this trims inventory costs, it requires businesses to forecast demand for their goods accurately to ensure proper amounts of supplies are on hand.\n\nKaizenis a Japanese management philosophy that seeks to improve productivity gradually and methodically. It is a Japanese word that means \"change for the better\" or \"continuous improvement.\"\n\nKaizen seeks to involve all employees and improve operations on a continuous basis. Characteristics of kaizen include designing a workplace to be more efficient and impactful by creating a team atmosphere, improving everyday procedures, making sure employees are engaged, and seeking to make jobs more fulfilling, safer, and less tiring.\n\nWith so many stocks to choose from, it can be hard to know which one to pick for yourportfolio. In choosing a stock, it's important to know what you want your portfolio to look like and to keep that in mind as time goes by.\n\nAs aninvestor, it's critical to be aware of daily news, not only for the companies you are analyzing or have already invested in but also for world and financial news, as these impact stocks as well. Reading the news is probably the first step in deciding what stock to pick. Understanding which companies are trending, whatsectorsare primed to do well, and where the economy is heading, will give you an idea of where to start looking.\n\nFrom there, start compiling a list of stocks that interest you. For example, if you read that new technology has emerged that has made another product obsolete (for example,smartphonesmaking traditional landlines obsolete), you may start looking into such companies.\n\nYou can find stocks through research of who the main players are in the sector you are interested in. Conversely, you can look atexchange traded funds(ETFs) that invest in the sector. You can also usescreenersto sort through companies based on a variety of factors, such asmarket capandearnings. From there, a detailedanalysisof a company's financial statements would provide you with information you need regarding the company's health.\n\nBest practices in education include staying proactive by ensuring your next teaching activity is prepared and set to go before the current one finishes. This allows students to be engaged by reducing disruptions. Encourage communication by involving students in the classroom setting. This can include varying the way in which they provide answers (e.g. verbal, written, visual, in groups, etc.). Work backward by setting an end goal and figuring out how to reach that goal with your students. Always keep your resources, such as lesson plans, so you can build upon what you have done before and refine the way you approach teaching. And lastly, be a role model by setting the examples you want your students to exhibit.\n\nBest practices inhealthcareinclude training your staff so that they know how to deliver great service and put patient care and experience as their main priority. Ensure patient education, which has been proven to improve the overall healthcare experience. A patient that understands the what and why of their health and the care they are getting are usually happier and more comfortable. Establish a care-orientated environment by incorporating small details, such as remembering a patient's name, smiling, listening carefully, and incorporating follow-up calls.\n\nGood customer service starts with good employees. Ensure you are hiring the best people and incentivizing them to join your firm and stay. This can be done through good pay and benefits as well as the overall corporate environment.\n\nManage customer expectations. Telling a customer that everything will be taken care of is easy, but this isn't always the case. Being upfront and honest with a customer will always keep them grounded and prevent them from being disappointed.\n\nWith customer service, first impressions count. Make sure the first impression is perfect. This sets the tone for future engagement and shapes customers' opinions of the service they're receiving. Collect as much data as you can to help them and also personalize the experience.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. \"About the FASB.\" Accessed August 9, 2021.\n\nPM World 360 Magazine. \"How Do You Implement Best Practices?\" Accessed August 9, 2021.\n\nClassful Shop. \"Best Practices in Education.\" Accessed August 9, 2021.\n\nBusinessWire. \"Eight Best Practices to Improve Patient Care in the Healthcare Industry | Infiniti Research.\" Accessed May 14, 2021.\n\nSalesForce. \"7 Best Practices for Top-Notch Customer Service.\" Accessed May 14, 2021.",
