  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA Master of Public Administration is a professional graduate degree designed to prepare individuals for leadership and management roles in the public sector, including government and nonprofit organizations.\n\nA Master of Public Administration (MPA) is a master\u2019s degree in public affairs. An MPA prepares recipients to serve in executive positions in municipal, state, andfederalgovernment andnongovernmental organizations (NGOs).\n\nA Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree is considered the public-sector equivalent of aMaster of Business Administration (MBA)degree in theprivate sector. It is also closely related to the more theoretical Master of Public Policy (MPP) degree.\n\nThe MPP focuses on policy analysis and design, while the MPA focuses on program implementation. Many graduate schools offer a combinedJ.D. (law degree)and MPA; a few offer combined MBA/MPA programs. The program\u2019s focus centers on principles of public administration, policy development and management, and implementation of policies. It also prepares the candidate to deal with specific challenges faced in public administration.\n\nAs a professional-level degree, the MPA requires students to first have an undergraduate-level degree from eligible universities. Students enrolled in an MPA program are expected to possess above-average leadership skills and competence in economic andquantitative analysis, among other skill requirements.\n\nGraduating with an MPA degree allows students to apply for work in various upper-management positions in the federal government, nonprofits, global NGOs, and private companies. MPA holders may find employment as public policy advocates and researchers as well.\n\nMPA students are required to have a bachelor\u2019s degree from an accredited college or university; many graduate schools also require applicants to take theGraduate Record Examination (GRE)before applying. Programs are interdisciplinary and include classes in economics, sociology, law, anthropology, and political science.\n\nMost programs require two years for completion. Some executive MPA programs designed for experienced, mid-career professionals can be completed in one year. Also, a limited number of programs grant a Doctor of Public Administration (DPA), which is a terminal degree usually intended for research. The DPA is considered on par with a Ph.D.\n\nThe pay for MPA-required jobs varies. For example, according to Glassdoor, the average starting salary for someone with an MPA is between $90,000 and $169,000 of total pay (as of June 2025).However, pay per position can widely vary; for example, employment as a political scientist, which often requires an MPA, starts at an annual median salary of $139,380, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on 2024 median pay.\n\nGraduates with an MPA degree are primed for leadership roles within private, public, and nonprofit agencies. Those who earn an MPA are often well-rounded in various areas, including policy, law, business, finance, and management.\n\nOften, newly minted MPA graduates start as analysts, researchers, grant writers, and program managers, but these entry-level positions usually become executive positions. For those with experience and an MPA, there is a likelihood of being directly hired at a senior level.\n\nBecause MPA graduates usually possess a keen knowledge of policy and public affairs, plus an understanding of how policies impact business and economics, there are plenty of job opportunities in the private and nonprofit sectors.\n\nHaving an MPA offers opportunities to work with human rights groups; schools; nonprofit medical centers; charitable organizations; public media, such as radio and broadcasting; development groups; and international organizations, to name a few career paths.\n\nGetting an MPA, like any advanced degree, takes time and money. If you decide to get an MPA, you will most likely take a variety of exciting courses. Unlike some master\u2019s programs, you don\u2019t need any particular undergraduate degree to be accepted into an MPA program.\n\nIndividuals with MPAs may graduate with multiple job opportunities in a broad spectrum of career paths. There are many advantages to getting an MPA beyond money and prestige, and earning an MPA often means enrolling in a variety of interesting courses, from international affairs to environmental law.\n\nHowever, these jobs may be highly competitive, and public administrators may find themselves in high-stress jobs with low turnover rates.Executive positionsare often not vacated until someone retires, especially if the pay and profile are high. High-profile positions in public administration mean working one-on-one with individuals and groups, so these jobs may be challenging for those who prefer to work independently or without drawing attention to themselves.\n\nProvides entry into a variety of careers, including overseas\n\nStudying for an MPA often means interesting coursework.\n\nYou don\u2019t need a specific undergraduate degree to apply to an MPA program.\n\nGetting your MPA may be expensive depending on the program.\n\nJobs that call for an MPA may mean long hours and high stress.\n\nCoursework to earn an MPA can be challenging.\n\nThe firstmaster\u2019s degreeprogram in public administration was established at the University of Michigan in 1914 as part of the Department of Political Science. The goal was to improve efficiency inmunicipal governmentand eliminate corruption. The program was developed by department chair Jesse S. Reeves, who later served as a technical advisor to the League of Nations Hague Conference in 1930. The program has since expanded to a full graduate school known as the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.\n\nThe John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Woodrow Wilson School of Government at Princeton University (now the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs) were founded in the middle of theGreat Depressionas part of a broader move to give the government and social services a scientific and professional grounding.\n\nTheNew Dealprograms of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt significantly increased the scope of the U.S. government and its programs, creating a need for skilled, professional managers.\n\nTrying to decide between getting an MPA or anMBA degreewill depend on whether or not you prefer studying business or public policy, although there is some crossover. Most graduates with an MBA work in finance in the private sector, and MPA graduates often end up in executive roles in nonprofits and government.\n\nMBA graduates don\u2019t usually work on the policy side of finance and economics. In contrast, an MPA holder may work in the private sector, studying the policies behind financial markets and why they succeed or fail. MPAs tend to work in organizations focused on improving the world, like nonprofits or nongovernmental organizations.\n\nBoth MPA and MBA holders may find work abroad and will have (most likely) earned the credentials to work for global companies. Neither is a better degree than the other, and both can be useful in many different industries and job markets.\n\nEvery year, many institutions curate their list of best MPA programs. One such source is U.S. News & World Report, known for ranking various different educational programs such as undergraduate degrees or MBA programs.\n\nU.S. News has ranked the following schools as the top programs in 2025. Note that the peer review score is on a 1-to-5 scale (with 5 being the best possible score). In total, 268 different MPA programs were ranked.\n\nGraduates with an MPA degree can pursue a wide range of careers, mainly in the public and nonprofit sectors. Opportunities include roles such as government administrators, policy analysts, program managers, nonprofit directors, international development specialists, and urban planners.\n\nWhile work experience is not always required for admission, many MPA programs value applicants with relevant professional experience in public service, nonprofit organizations, or related fields. Consider how work experience may make your application even stronger when applying to attend.\n\nIt usually takes two years to earn an MPA degree. Some programs offer qualified and motivated students the option to complete an MPA in just one year.\n\nAn MPA program often consists of coursework in law, international affairs, political theory, urban planning, nonprofit organizations, and public service leadership, among other subjects.\n\nThe Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree is a professionally oriented graduate degree intended for students who wish to work in government agencies, nonprofits, NGOs, and other policy-related institutions. Coursework is typically centered around policy making and analysis, public administration, organizational leadership, financial accounting, and research methods. MPA degrees are often a prerequisite for certain high-level policy or government jobs, and MPA programs are now offered by many of the top universities.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Political Scientists: Summary.\u201d\n\nNetwork of Schools of Public Policy, Affairs, and Administration. \u201cAbout NASPAA.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Michigan, Gerald R.
