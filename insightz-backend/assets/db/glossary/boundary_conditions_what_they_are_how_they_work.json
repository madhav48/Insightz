  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nBoundary conditions are the maximum and minimum values used to indicate where the price of anoptionmust lie. Boundary conditions are used to estimate what an option may be priced at, but the actual price of the option may be higher or lower than what is set as the boundary condition.\n\nFor all options contracts, the minimum boundary value is always zero, since options cannot be priced at negative money. Meanwhile, maximum boundary values will differ depending on the whether the option is a call or put, and if it is anAmerican optionorEuropean option.\n\nBefore the introduction ofbinomial treepricing models and theBlack-Scholesmodel, investors and traders relied heavily on boundary conditions to set the minimum and maximum possible values for the call and put options that they were pricing. These boundary conditions change according to whether the option is American or European, since American options can beexercised early.\n\nThis ability to exercise at any point prior to the expiration date affects the way the price is calculated, and American options will trade at a premium relative to equivalent European options by virtue of this feature.\n\nThe absolute minimum value for an option is zero, since an option cannot be sold for a negative amount of money. The maximum value in a boundary condition is set to the current value of the underlying asset. If the price of theunderlying assetis greater than the price indicated in thecall option, then the investor would not exercise the option, since exercising the option would result in the investor paying more than themarket price. This is the case for both a European call and an American call.\n\nThe maximum value of aput optionis reached when the underlying asset has no worth, such as in the case of a company's bankruptcy when the underlying security is a stock. For a European put option, the maximum value computed as\u00a0is thepresent valueof theexercise price. This is because European options cannot be exercised at any point, and instead can only be exercised at expiration at a specified price. The value of an American option must be at least as great as a European option.\n\nWhile technically the maximum value of an asset could be set at infinity\u2014an asset could increase in value with no ceiling\u2014this is considered impractical. The value of the underlying asset is likely to fall within a reasonable boundary that can be modeled with standard deviations or other stochastic methods.",
