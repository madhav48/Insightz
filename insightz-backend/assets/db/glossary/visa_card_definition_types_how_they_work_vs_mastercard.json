The San Francisco-based company began with justcredit cardsbut later expanded to include debit, prepaid, and gift cards. Although Visa cards bear Visa's name and logo, they are not issued by Visa but instead by partner financial institutions and banks.\n\nVisa is a prominent processing networkwhereby its cards are accepted by businesses in more than 200 countries and territories worldwide.Other majorpayment processing networksincludeMastercard,American Express, andDiscover.\n\nFinancial institutions typically partner with a single processing network provider, such as Visa, for all of their payment card products. Each issuer sets its ownterms and conditionsfor the Visa cards it offers and decides on the customers to whom it will offer them. Visa cards are available to individual and business customers through various financial institution partnerships.\n\nVisa also partners with merchants through varying types of service agreements. Merchants that accept Visa cards pay Visa Inc. atransaction feeeach time a customer uses their Visa card.\n\nAll Visa cards come with a unique 16-digit number printed or embossed on the front and an embeddedmicrochipintended to provide the cardholder with additional protection against fraud. There's also amagnetic stripeon the back, with a panel for the cardholder's signature and a three-digitvalidation code.\n\nAlthough branded with the Visa name, Visa cards are issued by financial institutions, not Visa itself.\n\nSeveral different types of payment cards are branded with the Visa logo and use the Visa payment processing network: credit cards, debit cards, prepaid cards, and gift cards. Here is how each of them works.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions issue Visa credit cards to consumers whom they deemcreditworthybased on theircredit reportand other information. Like other types ofcredit cards, Visa credit cards provide cardholders with convenience and security and can be used at merchants andautomated teller machines (ATMs)worldwide.\n\nDepending on the particular card and issuer, some Visa cards have features such as0% introductory annual percentage rates (APRs), cashback rewards, and unique benefits when shopping with a particular retailer. All Visa credit cards come with the Visa Zero Liability Policy, which reduces cardholders' liability for unauthorized transactions to $0.Under federal law, their liability is generally limited to $50.\n\nThe card's interest rate is determined by the card issuer, who may also charge various fees, including the following:\n\nVisadebit cardsare linked to a cardholder's bank account, typically a checking account. Like a credit card, they can be used to make purchases at retailers and perform routine bank transactions at a branch or through an ATM.Unlike credit cards, debit cards do not extend credit but are limited to the amount of money in the cardholder'sbank account.\n\nAs with Visa credit cards, Visa debit cards come with the Visa Zero Liability Policy for unauthorized transactions.\n\nPrepaid cardswork like debit cards but are not associated with abank account. Instead, they come loaded with a specific amount of money that acts as a credit limit. This means the cardholder can\u2019t spend more than the amount loaded onto the card.Visa's prepaid cards can be used anywhere Visa is accepted and can be reloaded for future use.\n\nIn addition to its all-purpose prepaid cards, Visa has several types of specialized prepaid cards. Those include:\n\nRather than issuing their employees checks or making direct deposits into theirbank accounts, employers can pay them by regularly loading their pay onto a Visa payroll card, which works like any other prepaid card.\n\nSome states use these cards to pay monthly unemployment benefits. The federal government also used them to distribute benefits as part of theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\n\nGift cardswith the Visa logo are preloaded with a specific amount like a prepaid card and can be used wherever Visa is accepted. Theprincipal difference between themand prepaid cards is that gift cards can't be reloaded.\n\nBoth Visa and Mastercard are vast, worldwide payment networks with similar operations. Neither issues its own credit cards but instead partners withbanksand other financial institutions that do. Consumers with both types of cards may notice little or no difference between them. Conversely, American Express and Discover are payment networks that issue credit cards through their own banking affiliates.\n\nYes, some financial institutions issuesecured credit cardswith the Visa logo. Secured cards are a type of credit card tailored for those withpoor creditor little or no credit history. To qualify for one, the individual must deposit a sum of money in a bank account, which serves as their credit line. After using secured credit for a certain period\u2014and paying their bills on time\u2014they may qualify for an unsecured credit card.\n\nThe microchips embedded on the front of Visa cards and other brands of cards carryencrypted informationabout the cardholder and their account. Themicrochipsare designed to be more secure than the magnetic stripes on the cards' backs, which carry similar information. Today, most cards have both chips and stripes because some merchants have not yet switched over to sales terminals compatible with chip technology.\n\nVisa is a major payment card processing network, and cards bearing its logo are widely accepted worldwide. Whatever type of card a consumer might be looking for, a Visa-affiliated issuer probably offers it.\n\nVisa. \"Unlocking Opportunities for Everyone.\"\n\nExperian. \"Everything You Need to Know About Credit Card Issuers.\"\n\nVisa. \"Pay Every Day With a Visa Traditional Credit Card.\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Am I Responsible for Unauthorized Charges if My Credit Cards Are Lost or Stolen?\"\n\nVisa. \"Visa Debit Cards Are Fast, Easy, and Convenient.\"\n\nVisa. \"With Zero Liability You're Not Responsible for Unauthorized Charges.\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"What Is the Difference Between a Prepaid Card, a Credit Card, and a Debit Card?\"\n\nVisa. \"Discover the Advantages of Prepaid.\"\n\nVisa. \"How Payroll Cards Work.\"\n\nVisa. \"About Government Payments Cards.\"\n\nVisa. \"FAQ About Visa Gift Cards.\"",
