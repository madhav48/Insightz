  "definition": "The asset coverage ratio is a key financial metric that measures how well a company can repay its debts by selling or liquidating its assets. It's important because it helps lenders, investors, and analysts measure a company's financialsolvencyand risk profile. A higher asset coverage ratio generally indicates that the company has more than enough assets to cover its debt, making it less risky to lenders; a lower ratio suggests that it may face difficulty paying its debt.\u00a0Banks and creditors often consider a minimum asset coverage ratio before lending money.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio allows creditors and investors to gauge the level of risk associated with investing in a company. Once the coverage ratio is calculated, it can be compared to the ratios of companies within the same industry or sector, helping to determine whether a company carries a manageable debt level compared to its peers.\n\nIt's important to note that the ratio is less reliable when compared to companies in different industries. Companies within certain industries may typically carry more debt on their balance sheets than those in other industries.\n\nFor example, companies in the tech sector, like Microsoft and Meta, generally operate with relatively low debt levels compared to theirmarket capitalization, due to the nature of their business. In contrast, companies in capital-intensive industries, such as ExxonMobil in theoil and gas industry,often carry higher debt levels to finance expensive equipment like oil rigs. Exxon ended the second quarter of 2024 with $36.57 billion in long-term debt.Despite these higher debt levels, ExxonMobil\u2019s substantial assets allow it to maintain a healthy asset coverage ratio.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio is calculated with the following equation:\n\n(Total\u00a0Assets\u2212Intangible\u00a0Assets)\u2212(Current\u00a0Liabilities\u2212Short-term\u00a0Debt)Total\u00a0Debt\\begin{aligned}&\\frac{(\\text{Total Assets}-\\text{Intangible Assets})-(\\text{Current Liabilities}-\\text{Short-term Debt})}{\\text{Total Debt}}\\end{aligned}\u200bTotal\u00a0Debt(Total\u00a0Assets\u2212Intangible\u00a0Assets)\u2212(Current\u00a0Liabilities\u2212Short-term\u00a0Debt)\u200b\u200b\n\nHere's a breakdown of this formula:\n\nAll of these components can be found in a company\u2019s annual report, on its balance sheet.\n\nCompanies that issue shares of stock or equity to raise funds don't have a financial obligation to pay those funds back to investors. However, when companies issue debt through bonds or borrow from banks, they must make regular payments and eventually repay the principal.\n\nAs a result, banks and investors holding a company's debt want to know whether itsearningsor profits are sufficient to cover future debt obligations\u00a0and what might happen if earnings fall short.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio is a keysolvency ratiothat addresses this concern. It measures how well a company can cover itsshort-term debtobligations using its assets, especially when earnings may not suffice.\n\nA higher asset coverage ratio indicates that a company has enough assets to cover its debts multiple times, making it less risky for lenders.\n\nIf earnings aren't enough to cover the company's financial obligations, the company might be required to sell assets to generate cash. The asset coverage ratio tells creditors and investors how often the company's assets can cover its debts if earnings are insufficient to cover debt payments.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio is more extreme than the debt service ratio, as it reflects the company\u2019s ability to cover its debts by liquidating assets. This scenario represents a last resort, typically used only in financial distress situations.\n\nThere's one caveat to consider when interpreting the asset coverage ratio. Assets found on the balance sheet are recorded at theirbook value, which is often higher than the liquidation or selling value if a company needs to sell assets to repay debts.So, the asset coverage ratio may appear slightly inflated, presenting a more favorable view of a company\u2019s ability to cover its debts than is realistic. This is why it's important to compare the asset coverage ratio with other companies within the same industry.\n\nLet's say, for example, that Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) has an asset coverage ratio of 1.5, indicating it has 1.5 times more assets than debts. Let's say Chevron Corporation (CVX)\u2014within the same industry as Exxon\u2014has a comparable ratio of 1.4.\n\nHowever, if Chevron's previous ratios were 0.8 and 1.1, the current 1.4 suggests financial improvement through increasing assets ordeleveraging(paying down debt). Conversely, if Exxon's asset coverage ratio was 2.2 and 1.8 for the prior two periods, the current 1.5 ratio could be the start of a worrisome trend of decreasing assets or increasing debt.\n\nIt's not enough to merely analyze one period's asset coverage ratio. Instead, it's important to determine the trend over multiple periods and compare it with similar companies.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio is calculated by taking a company's total assets, subtracting intangible assets and current liabilities (excluding short-term debt), and dividing the result by the total debt. It helps assess how well a company can cover its debt obligations using its tangible assets, with all necessary components on its balance sheet.\n\nA good asset coverage ratio generally exceeds 1.0, indicating that a company has enough assets to cover its debt. However, what is considered \"good\" can vary by industry. For example, utility companies typically have healthy ratios ranging from 1.0 to 1.5. However, a higher ratio in the range of 1.5 to 2.0 or more is often preferred for capital-intensive industries like capital goods.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio has limitations, such as differences when comparing companies across industries and the accuracy of the asset values on the balance sheet, which often doesn't match its liquidation value.It's best to consider this ratio alongside other financial metrics to get a clearer picture of a company's financial standing.\n\nThe asset coverage ratio is a financial metric that helps assess a company's ability to repay its debt using its assets. A higher ratio generally indicates a lower risk to lenders, but the ideal ratio can vary depending on the industry.\n\nWhile useful, this ratio has limitations and should be considered alongside other financial metrics, such as thedebt-to-equity ratioand theinterest coverage ratio. Also, comparing the asset coverage ratio over time and against its industry peers provides a more comprehensive view of a company\u2019s finances.\n\nExxonMobil. \"10-Q: Balance Sheet.\"\n\nNYU Stern. \"Investment Fables, Chapter 4: Less Than Book Value!
