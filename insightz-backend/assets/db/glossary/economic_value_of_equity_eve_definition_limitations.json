  "definition": "The economic value of equity (EVE) is a\u00a0cash flow calculation that takes the present value of all asset cash flows and subtracts the present value of all liability cash flows. Unlike earnings at risk and value at risk (VAR), a bank uses\u00a0the economic value of equity\u00a0to manage its assets and liabilities. This is a long-term economic measure used to assess the degree ofinterest rate riskexposure\u2014as opposed to net-interest income (NII), which reflects short-term interest rate risk.\n\nThe simplest definition of EVE is thenet present value(NPV) of a bank's balance sheet's cash flows.\u00a0This calculation is used\u00a0forasset-liability managementto measure changes in the economic value of the bank.\n\nEVE risk is defined as a bank's value sensitivity to changes in market rates.\n\nThe economic value of equity is a cash flow calculation that subtracts the present value of the expected cash flows on liabilities from the present value of all expected asset cash flows. This value is used as an estimate of total capital when evaluating the sensitivity of total capital to fluctuations in interest rates. A bank may use this measure to create models that indicate how interest rate changes will affect its total capital.\n\nThe fair market values of a bank's assets and liabilities are directly linked to interest rates. A bank\u00a0constructs models with all constituent assets and liabilities\u00a0that show the effect of different interest rate changes on its total capital. Thisrisk analysisis a key tool that allows banks to prepare against constantly changing interest rates and to perform stress tests.\n\nAn internationally accepted standard for determining interest rate risk is tostress-testEVE. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recommends a plus and minus 2% stress test on all interest rates and US bank regulations require regular analysis of EVE.\n\nThe economic value of equity\u00a0should not be confused with the earnings profile of a bank. A general rise in interest rates may boost earnings of a bank, but it would normally cause a decrease in the economic value of equity because of the basic inverse relationship between asset values and interest rates and direct relationship (same direction) between values of liabilities and interest rates. However, EVE and bank earnings do bear a relationship in that the higher the EVE, the greater the potential for increased future earnings generated from theequitybase.\n\nBank regulators require banks to conduct periodic\u00a0EVE calculations.\n\nWhile the net present value of a bond can be calculated quite easily, future cash flows can be difficult to quantify for deposit accounts and other financial instruments that have no maturity because these types of products have uncertain duration and uneven cash flows. EVE modelers must make assumptions for certain liabilities, which may deviate from reality. In addition\u2014because EVE is a comprehensive calculation\u2014complex products with embedded options are not easily modeled and leave wide room for interpretation and subjective judgement of the modelers or their supervisors.\n\nFederal Reserve System. \u201cCommercial Bank Examination Manual, October 2023,\u201d Page 857.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \u201cStress Testing Principles.\u201d",
