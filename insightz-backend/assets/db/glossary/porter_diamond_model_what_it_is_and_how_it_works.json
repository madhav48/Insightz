  "term": "Porter Diamond Model: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "The Porter Diamond Theory of National Advantage, or the Porter Diamond Model, is a model that describes thecompetitive advantagethat nations or groups possess based on factors available to them. The theory explains how governments can act to improve a country's position in a globally competitive economic environment.\n\nCreated by Michael Porter, founder of the Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness at the Harvard Business School, the Porter Diamond Model is considered a proactive economic theory.\n\nThe Porter Diamond Model suggests that countries can create advantages for themselves, such as a strong technology industry or a skilled labor force.\u00a0Another application of the Porter Diamond Model is used in corporate strategy as a framework to analyze the relative merits of investing and operating in national markets.\n\nThe Porter Diamond Model is visually represented by a diagram that resembles the points of a diamond and includes the interrelated determinants that Porter theorizes as the deciding factors of national comparative economic advantage:\n\nHarvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter created the Porter Diamond Model andPorter's Five Forces.\n\nFirm strategy, structure, and rivalry define that competition leads to increased production and the development of technological innovations. The concentration of market power, degree of competition, and ability of rival firms to enter a nation's market are influential.\n\nRelated supporting industries consider the upstream and downstream industries that facilitate innovation through exchanging ideas. These can spur innovation depending on the degree of transparency and knowledge transfer.\n\nDemand conditions refer to the size and nature of the customer base for products, which also drives innovation and product improvement. Larger consumer markets will demand and stimulate a need to differentiate, innovate, and increase market scale for businesses.\n\nAccording to Porter, the most important of the five points is factor conditions. Factor conditions are those elements that Porter believes a country's economy can create for itself, such as a large pool ofskilled labor, technological innovation,infrastructure, and capital. One way for the government to accomplish that goal is to stimulate competition between domestic companies by establishing and enforcing anti-trust laws.\n\nThe Porter Diamond Model purports that a country's economy can create skilled labor, technological innovation, infrastructure, and capital, and these factors outweigh naturally inherited factors such as land and natural resources.\n\nJapan has developed a competitive global economic presence beyond the country's inherent resources by producing a large number of engineers who have helped drive technological innovation in Japanese industries.\n\nThe theory helps businesses understand why certain industries are widespread in some nations. Companies can then analyze and compare their position in the market and implement strategies to compete.\n\nSimilar to the Porter Diamond Model, Porter's Five Forces model of business strategy identifies and analyzes five competitive forces that shape every industry and help determine an industry's weaknesses and strengths.\n\nThe Porter Diamond Model explains the factors that provide a competitive advantage for one national economy or business over another. The points of the theory resembling a diamond include the firm strategy, structure and rivalry, related industries, demand conditions, and factor conditions. The model can be used by businesses to guide and shape strategies regarding investing and operating in national markets.\n\nHarvard Business School, Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness. \"About the Institute.\"\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"The Competitive Advantage of Nations.\"",
