  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nRoy's Safety First Criterion is a formula to determine the probability that an investment portfolio will provide the expected returns.\n\nRoy's safety-first criterion, also known as the SFRatio, is a risk management approach that sets a minimum required return for a given level ofrisk. It is used to determine the probability that a given portfolio will meet or exceed the investor's expected returns.\n\nRoy's safety-first criterion allows investors to compare potential portfolio investments based on the probability that the portfolio returns will fall below their minimum desired return threshold.\n\n\ufeffSFRatio=re\u2212rm\u03c3pwhere:re=Expected\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0portfoliorm=Investor\u2019s\u00a0minimum\u00a0required\u00a0return\u03c3p=Standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0portfolio\\begin{aligned} &SFRatio = \\frac{r_e-r_m}{\\sigma_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &r_e = \\text{Expected return on portfolio}\\\\ &r_m = \\text{Investor's minimum required return}\\\\ &\\sigma_p = \\text{Standard deviation of the portfolio}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bSFRatio=\u03c3p\u200bre\u200b\u2212rm\u200b\u200bwhere:re\u200b=Expected\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0portfoliorm\u200b=Investor\u2019s\u00a0minimum\u00a0required\u00a0return\u03c3p\u200b=Standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0portfolio\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe SFRatio is calculated by subtracting the minimum desired return from theexpected returnof a portfolio and dividing the result by thestandard deviationofportfolio returns. The optimal portfolio will be the one that minimizes the probability that the portfolio's return will fall below a threshold level.\n\nThe SFRatio provides a probability of getting aminimum-required returnon a portfolio. An investor's optimal decision is to choose the portfolio with the highest SFRatio. Investors can use the formula to calculate and evaluate various scenarios involving different asset-class weights, different investments and other factors that affect the probability of meeting their minimum return threshold.\n\nSome investors feel that Roy's safety-first criterion is arisk-managementphilosophy in addition to being an evaluation method. By choosing investments that adhere to a minimum acceptable portfolio return, an investor can sleep at night knowing that her investment will achieve a minimum return, and anything above that is \"gravy.\"\n\nThe SFRatio is very similar to theSharpe ratio; for normally distributed returns, the minimum return is equal to the risk-free rate.\n\nAssume three portfolios with various expected returns and standard deviations. Portfolio A has an expected return of 12% with a standard deviation of 20%. Portfolio B has an expected return of 10% with a standard deviation of 10%. Portfolio C has an expected return of 8% with a standard deviation of 5%. The threshold return for the investor is 5%.\n\nWhich portfolio should the investor choose? SFRatio for A: (12 - 5) / 20 = 0.35; B: (10 - 5) / 10 = 0.50; C: (8 - 5) / 5 = 0.60. Portfolio C has the highest SFRatio and thus should be selected.",
