  "definition": "Cash flow is the total amount of money being transferred into and out of a business.\n\nCash flow is the movement of money into and out of a company over a certain period of time. If the company\u2019s inflows of cash exceed its outflows, its net cash flow is positive. If outflows exceed inflows, it is negative.\n\nPublic companies must report their cash flows on theirfinancial statements. This information can be of great interest to investors as an indicator of a company\u2019sfinancial health, especially when combined with other data.\n\nYou can easily calculate a company\u2019s net cash flow (NCF) using this formula:\n\nCash flow refers to the money that goes in and out of a business. Businesses take in money from sales asrevenues(inflow) and spend money onexpenses(outflow). They may also receive income from interest, investments,royalties, and licensing agreements and sell products on credit rather than for immediate cash. Assessing cash flows is essential for evaluating a company\u2019sliquidity, flexibility, and overall financial performance.\n\nPositive cash flow indicates that acompany\u2019s liquid assetsare increasing, enabling it to cover obligations, reinvest in its business, return money to shareholders, pay expenses, and provide a buffer against future financial challenges. Companies with strong financial flexibility fare better, especially when the economy experiences a downturn, by avoiding the costs offinancial distress.\n\nCash flows are reported on acash flow statement, which is a standard financial statement that shows a company\u2019s cash sources and use over a specified period. Corporate management, analysts, and investors use this statement to judge how well a company is able to pay its debts and manage its operating expenses. The cash flow statement is one of several financial statements issued by public companies, which also include abalance sheetand anincome statement.\n\nThe cash flow statement acts as a corporate checkbook to reconcile a company\u2019s balance sheet and income statement.The cash flow statement includes thebottom line, recorded as the net increase/decrease incash and cash equivalents (CCE).\n\nThe bottom line reports the overall change in the company\u2019s cash and cash equivalents over the last period.\n\nCash flow from operations (CFO)describes money flows involved directly with the production and sale of goods from ordinary operations. Also known asoperating cash flow or OCF, as well as net cash from operating activities, CFO indicates whether or not a company has enough funds coming in to pay its bills oroperating expenses.\n\nIt is calculated by taking cash received from sales and subtracting operating expenses that were paid in cash for the period.\n\nCash flow from investing (CFI)or investing cash flow reports how much cash has been generated or spent from various investment-related activities in a specific period. Investing activities include purchases of speculativeassets, investments insecurities, or sales of securities or assets.\n\nNegative cash flow from investing activities might be due to significant amounts of cash being invested in the company, such asresearch and development (R&D), and is not always a warning sign.\n\nCash flow from financing (CFF)shows the net flows of cash used to fund the company and its capital. CFF is also commonly referred to as financing cash flow. Financing activities include transactions involving the issuance of debt or equity, and paying dividends.\n\nCash flow from financing activities provides investors with insight into a company\u2019s financial strength and how well itscapital structureis managed.\n\nUsing the cash flow statement in conjunction with other financial statements can help analysts and investors make informed decisions and recommendations. Often-used measures include:\n\nBelow is the cash flow statement for Walmart (WMT) for thefiscal yearending on Jan. 31, 2025. All amounts are in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nWalmart\u2019s investments inproperty, plant, and equipment (PP&E)and acquisitions of other businesses are accounted for in the cash flows from investing activities section. Proceeds from issuing long-term debt, debt repayments, and dividends paid out are accounted for in the cash flows from financing activities section.\n\nWalmart\u2019s cash flow was negative, showing a net decrease of $399 million, which indicates that it lost cash in the business and drained from its reserves to handle short-term liabilities and fluctuations in the future.\n\nCash flow refers to the amount of money moving into and out of a company, while revenue represents the income the company earns on the sales of its products and services.\n\nAgain, cash flow simply describes the flow of cash into and out of a company.Profitis the amount of money the company has left after subtracting its expenses from its revenues.\n\nFree cash flow (FCF)is the money left over after a company\u00a0pays for\u00a0its\u00a0operating expenses\u00a0and\u00a0any capital expenditures. Companies are free to use FCF however they choose to. Free cash flow is considered an important measure of a company\u2019s profitability and financial health.\n\nTheprice-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratiocompares a stock\u2019s price to its operating cash flow per share. P/CF is especially useful for valuing stocks with a positive cash flow but that are not profitable because of largenon-cash charges.\n\nYes, in the case ofpublic companies. Cash flow statements have been required by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)since 1987.\n\nCash flow refers to money that goes in and out of a business. Companies with a positive cash flow have more money coming in than they are spending. However, cash flow alone can sometimes provide a deceptive picture of a company\u2019s financial health, so it is often used in conjunction with other data.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cBeginners\u2019 Guide To Financial Statement.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, via Walmart Corporate News and Information. \u201cForm 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended January 31, 2025: Walmart Inc.\u201d Page 57.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. \u201cSummary of Statement No. 95.\u201d",
