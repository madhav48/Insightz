  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA hostile takeover bid is an attempt to buy a controlling interest in a publicly traded company without the consent or cooperation of the target company's\u00a0board of directors. If the board rejects an offer from a potential buyer, there are three possible courses of action for the would-be acquirer: make a tender offer, initiate a proxy fight, or buy up company stock in the open market.\n\nA takeover bid is most often launched by a company that wants to expand its business, eliminate a rival, or both. Thecompany may want toexpand its customer base, gain access to new distribution channels, grow its market share, or gain a technological advantage.\n\nA bid may also be made by an activist shareholder who sees an opportunity to improve the target company's performance and profit from its stock price appreciation.\n\nThe usual first step is to make an offer to the board of directors of the company to purchase a controlling stake in the company. The board of directors may reject that offer on the grounds that it isnot in the best interestof the company's shareholders.\n\nAt that point, a hostile takeover bid might be launched.\n\nThe would-be acquirer can attempt to buy enough shares of the company's stock on the open market to achieve a controlling share. That is far from easy given the fact that the acquisition of large amounts of a company's stock inevitablypushes its price progressively higher. Since the reason for the price rise has no relationship to the company's performance, the aggressor is likely to overpay.\n\nThe would-be acquirer may make atender offerto the company's shareholders. A tender offer is a bid to buy a controlling share of the target's stock at a fixed price. The price is usually set above the current market price to allow the sellers an incentive to sell their shares.\u00a0This is a formal offer and may include specifications such as an offer expiry window. Paperwork must be filed with theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC), and the acquirer must provide a summary of its plans for the target company.\n\nCompanies can adopt takeover defense strategies to protect themselves against tender offers. In such cases, a proxy fight might be used.\n\nThe goal of aproxy fightis to replace board members who oppose the takeover with new board members who favor the takeover. This requires convincing shareholders that a change in management is needed. If shareholders like the idea of a change in management, they are persuaded to allow the potential acquirer to vote their shares by proxy in favor of a new board member or members. If the proxy fight is successful, the new board members are installed and vote in favor of the target's acquisition.\n\nThe hostile takeover was, to some extent, a creature of the 1980s, with a rash of well-publicized attempts by takeover specialists who became known as \"corporate raiders.\" Since then, they have occurred primarily in the aftermath of market downturns that have left some corporations looking like attractively priced targets.\n\nIn late 2020, the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance predicted another wave of hostile takeovers in the wake of the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.Sure enough, mergers and acquisitions activity broke records in 2021. According to a PwC report, 62,000 deals totaling $5.1 trillion were disclosed globally in 2021, and 130 of those deals were \"megadeals\" valued at more than $5 billion.\n\nHarvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance. \"The Comeback of Hostile Takeovers.\"\n\nPwC. \"Global M&A Industry Trends: 2022 Outlook.\"",
