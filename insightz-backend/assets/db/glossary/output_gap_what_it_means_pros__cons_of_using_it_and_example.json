  "definition": "The term output gap refers to the difference between the actual output of aneconomyand the maximum potential output of an economy\u00a0expressed as a percentage ofgross domestic product (GDP). A country's output gap may be either positive or negative. A negative output gap suggests that actual economic output is below the economy's full capacity for output\u00a0while a positive output suggests an economy that is outperforming expectations because its actual output is higher than the economy's recognized maximum capacity output.\n\nThe output gap is acomparison between actual GDP and potential GDPor output and maximum-efficiency output.This is difficult to calculate because you can't estimate an economy's optimal level ofoperating efficiency. There is little consensus among economists about the best way to measure potential GDP but most agree that full employment is a key component of maximum output.\n\nOne method that can be used to project potential GDP is to run atrend linethrough actual GDP over several decades or enough time to limit the impact of short-term peaks and valleys. By following the trend line, you can estimate where GDP currently sits or what it will be at a particular point in the near future.\n\nDetermining the output gap is a simple calculation of dividing the difference between the actual and potential GDP by the potential GDP.\n\nBecause potential output isn't observable, it's often determined using historical data.\n\nAn output gap is an unfavorable indicator of an economy'sefficiency, regardless of whether it's positive or negative.\n\nA positive output gap\u00a0indicates\u00a0a high demand for goods and services in an economy, which may be considered beneficial for an\u00a0economy. But the effect of\u00a0excessively high demand is that businesses and employees must work beyond their maximum efficiency level to meet the level of demand. A positive output gap commonly spursinflationin an economy because\u00a0bothlabor costsand the prices of goods increase\u00a0in response to the increased demand.\n\nA negative output gap, on the other hand, indicates a lack ofdemandfor goods and services in an economy\u00a0and can lead\u00a0to companies and employees operating below their maximum efficiency levels. This type of output gap points to a sluggish economy\u00a0and portends\u00a0a declining GDP growth rate and potentialrecessionas wages and prices of goods typically fall when overall economic demand is low.\n\nThe output gap is a very important economic indicator. While there are distinct advantages to using this metric, its use does come with certain drawbacks. We've listed some of the most common benefits and limitations to using the output gap below.\n\nBecause the output gap relies on the gross domestic product in its calculation, it helps provide a picture of how the economy is doing. More specifically, it can be used as a way to determine whether the economy is underperforming or is growing too quickly. That's because this gap can help determine the rate of inflation in an economy.\n\nThe output gap can help policymakers come up with solutions to move the economy in a more favorable direction. Therefore, it plays a very key role in how they make their decisions. about both fiscal and monetary policy.For instance, theFederal Reservewill raise interest rates to curb inflation and vice versa.\n\nBecause the output gap is used by both economists and analysts on the street, the general public can also use it to make informed decisions about their finances and investments. For example, a homeowner may decide to hold off on refinancing their mortgage if the output gap means there's a chance that interest rates will increase.\n\nOne of the main problems with the output gap is that it is hard to measure. The level of actual output is easy to determine because we know what's happening. But potential output isn't that easy to calculate because we can't determine it. The latter is a figure that can only be predicted or estimated.\n\nHow the potential output is measured can be problematic. In fact, there isn't just one way to do so. Analysts and economists may use different filters or models to do so. For instance, some experts may compute the potential output as the trend output while others consider it as the trend growth.\n\nAnother limitation to the output gap lies in how intertwined relationships are within the economy. For example, a less active workforce will lead to a drop in output. Similarly, distressed small businesses and corporations and tighter lending standards during tough economic times can also have a big impact on the potential output.\n\nIt provides a picture of how the economy is doing.\n\nPolicymakers are able to use output gap to help make decisions.\n\nConsumers and investors can make informed decisions about their finances and investments.\n\nOutput gap is hard to measure because we can't observe potential output.\n\nThere is no uniform way to measure potential output.\n\nPotential output relies heavily on relationships that are intertwined in the economy.\n\nThe actual GDP in the U.S. was $21.48 trillion through the fourth quarter of 2020, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the potential GDP for the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2020 was $21.17 trillion, meaning the U.S. had a positive output gap of about 20.16% (projected GDP subtracted from actual GDP/projected GDP).\n\nKeep in mind that this calculation is just one estimate of potential GDP in the U.S. Other analysts may have different estimates, but the consensus is that the U.S. was facing a positive output gap in 2020.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Federal Reserve Bank in the U.S. has consistently been raising interest rates since 2016, in part in response to the positive gap. Rates were at less than 1% in 2016 and hit as high as 1.25% in the early part of 2020. The global financial crisis, though, forced the Fed to drop rates back down below 1% in mid-March 2020.\n\nPotential output is what an economy can produce if it operates at full-employment-GDP. This is generally the highest level if and when the economy is doing very well. Unlike actual output, which is what currently happens, potential output cannot be measured and, therefore, relies on estimation.\n\nAn economy's output gap can deviate from its potential in one of two ways. A positive output indicatesthe economy is performing well above expectations. That's because the actual output is higher than its potential. It may also be negative when the output is below full capacity.\n\nGovernments may find that reducing government spending as well as cutting down transfer payments and their bond and security issues can help reduce an inflationary output gap.\n\nWhen an economy is in recession, it means that its actual output gap is lower than the potential output gap.\n\nGovernments can move the economy back to its potential GDP by taking a number of steps, including (but not limited to) reviewing tax rates and rebates, making moves on interest rates, and cutting or increasing government spending. The direction they choose depends on whether the actual output is positive or negative.\n\nJahan, Sarwat, and Ahmed Saber Mahmud. \"What Is the Output Gap?\"Back to Basics, IMF Finance & Development, vol. 50, no. 3, September 2013.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"What Is Potential Output, and How Is It Measured?\"\n\nWilliams, John C. \"The Perennial Problem of Predicting Potential.\"Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco Economic Letter, 2017-32, November 2017.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Fed Works to Balance Inflation\u2013Interest Rate Relationship.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"Gross Domestic Product, 4th Quarter and Year 2020 (Advance Estimate).\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED. \"Real Potential Gross Domestic Product.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Open Market Operations.\"",
