  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) is an organization that acts as both the issuer and guarantor foroptions and futures contracts. The largest equity derivatives clearing organization in the world, it operates under the jurisdiction of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe OCC should not be confused with the U.S. Treasury's Office of theComptroller of the Currency,which also goes by the acronym \"OCC.\"\n\nThe objective of the OCC, which was founded in 1973, is to instill stability in\u00a0theequity derivativesmarket. According to its mission statement, the OCC is a customer-drivenclearing organizationthat delivers risk management, clearance, and settlement services.\n\nUnder its SEC jurisdiction, the OCCclearstransactions for put and call options, stock indexes, foreign currencies, and interest rate composites. As a registered derivatives clearing organization (DCO) under CFTC jurisdiction, it provides clearing and settlement services for transactions in futures products, as well asoptions on futures.\n\nThe OCC also offers central counterparty clearing and settlement services for securities lending transactions.\n\nThe organization essentially acts as a guarantor to ensure the obligations of the contracts it clears are fulfilled. Aboard of directors(B of D) populated by representatives from exchanges, clearing members and management oversee the OCC, and most of its revenue comes fromclearing feescharged to its members.\n\nThe OCC also provides research services and other value-added solutions that support and grow the markets that it serves. The corporation serves 16 differentexchanges, including the C2 Options Exchange, Chicago Board Options Exchange, International Securities Exchange, Nasdaq BX Options, Nasdaq PHLX, NYSE American Options, and NYSE Arca Options.\n\nThe OCC cleared 9.93 billion contracts in 2021, the industry's highest ever annual volume.\n\nThe aftermath of the2008 financial crisisbrought new scrutiny and purpose to the OCC. Changes were made so it could adapt its operations to better address risk. Federal regulators began to see the OCC as an increasingly integral part of the governance and oversight of the markets. The heightened attention focused on the organization brought with it some unfavorable assessments by regulators.\n\nIn 2013, the SEC criticized the OCC\u2019s management and planning for the way it handled market-wide issues. The SEC also said the OCC\u2019s management at that time lacked appropriate supervision in terms ofcorporate governance. The SEC further cited numerousconflicts of interestwith the management and board of directors, which called into question the organization\u2019s commitment to regulatory compliance.\n\nThis led to the introduction of new executive leadership, including the addition of new positions to reinforce the OCC's compliance efforts.\n\nThe OCC's management and leadership currently consist of a diverse team of people from different parts of the investment world, including exchanges, clearing members, and other directors.As of Oct. 2022, key figures include:\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"What Is OCC?\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"Participant Exchanges & Futures Market.\"\n\nBusiness Wire. \"OCC Clears Record-Setting 9.93 Billion Total Contracts in 2021.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Testimony on 'Mitigating Systemic Risk in the Financial Markets Through Wall Street Reforms'.\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"OCC Executives.\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"Craig S.
