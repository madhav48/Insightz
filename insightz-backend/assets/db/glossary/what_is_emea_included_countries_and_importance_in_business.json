  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) is a geographical grouping and an acronym widely used by global corporations to define regional business activity. It is a shorthand method to refer to the three continents and their regional areas.\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) is a label that global firms use when dividing their operations by geography. EMEA\u00a0is a common division used in international business, but it is not precisely defined. It may or may not include Russia or Kazakhstan, for example and European overseas territories on other continents are generally excluded.\n\nA multinational may distinguish financial results by region, reporting sales and profits in the Americas, the\u00a0EMEA region, Asia Pacific, and Japan. Leadership roles are also based on these divisions. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), for example, has a President of Enterprise and Industry for EMEA.\n\nEMEA\u00a0is useful for operational purposes and business organization because most of the included region falls within fourtime zones, facilitating communication and travel.\n\nHowever, little unites the EMEA\u00a0region, which includes political, economic, linguistic, and cultural diversity. Political systems range from stable democracies to autocracies and local languages included Arabic, French, Russian, and English.\n\nEMEA is often subdivided or rearranged depending on a corporation's need to distinguish a region or area. If India is included in the grouping, a company may use EMEIA or EMIA.\n\nCompanies may sometimes separate their business operations in Eastern and Western Europe, referring instead to Eastern Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EEMEA) and the European Union (EU) or European Free Trade Association (EFTA).\n\nNations and regions are grouped based on what is most convenient for the corporation and may also include:\n\nMost countries located throughout eastern and southern Asia, those that touch the Pacific Ocean, and Oceania are usually considered APAC, or Asia Pacific, countries. There is no official definition of the Asia Pacific region and its boundaries and the list of APAC countries varies depending on the context and distinctions required by corporations.\n\nStock market and exchange news traditionally categorize activity by region and use EMEA to distinguish financial news for that region, such as EMEA Stocks or EMEA market indexes.\n\nSome business activities, like Marketing or Advertising, can be challenging when companies target and divided business to encompass the entire EMEA region as opposed to conducting business in North America. Creating a marketing plan for EMEA means considering local laws, cultures, and holidays among different regions. Corporations also have to account for economic and political factors, local government regulation, and product fit.\n\nEurope, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) is a geographical acronym used by many multinational corporations. It is a globally accepted term and standardizes news and business activity relating to the regional areas of EMEA. Corporations often distinguish sales divisions or leadership roles as EMEA positions.\n\nCEO Today Magazine. \"Microsoft Restructures EMEA Leadership to Strengthen AI Innovation and Industry Partnerships.\"",
