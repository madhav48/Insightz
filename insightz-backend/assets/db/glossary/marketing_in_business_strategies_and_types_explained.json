Marketing attempts to encourage market participants to buy their product andcommit loyalty to a specific company.\n\nMarketing is important for a few reasons. First, marketing campaigns may be the first time a customer interacts or is exposed to a company's product. A company has the opportunity to educate, promote, and encourage potential buyers.\n\nMarketing also helps shape the brand image a company wants to convey.

This is demonstrated through efforts to elevate customer satisfaction and remove any difficulties with the product or service.\n\nA commonly used concept in the marketing field, the Four Ps of marketing looks at four key elements of a marketing strategy. The Four Ps consist of product, price, place, and promotion.\n\nThere are dozens of types of marketing, and the types have proliferated with the introduction and rise of social media, mobile platforms, and technological advancements. Before technology, marketing might have been geared towards mail campaigns, word-of-mouth campaigns, billboards, delivery of sample products, TV commercials, or telemarketing. Now, marketing encompasses social media, targeted ads, e-mail marketing, inbound marketing to attract web traffic, and more.\n\nMarketing is an essential part of any business.
