  "definition": "Stock compensation is a way corporations usestock optionsto reward employees. Employees with stock options need to know whether their stock is vested and will retain its full value even if they are no longer employed with that company. Because tax consequences depend on thefair market value (FMV)of the stock, if the stock is subject to tax withholding, the tax must be paid in cash, even if the employee was paid byequity compensation.\n\nStock compensation is often used bystartup companiessince they\u00a0typically do not have the cash on hand to\u00a0pay employees competitive rates. Executives and staff may share in the company\u2019s growth and profits that way. However, many laws and compliance issues must be adhered to, such asfiduciary duty, tax treatment and deductibility, registration issues and expense charges.\n\nWhenvesting, companies let employees purchase a predetermined number of shares at a set price. Companies may vest on a specific date or on a monthly, quarterly, or annual schedule. The timing may be set according to company-wide or individual performance targets being met, or both time and performance criteria. Vesting periods are often three to four years, typically beginning after the first anniversary of the date an employee became eligible for stock compensation. After being vested, the employee mayexercise their stock-purchasing optionany time before the expiration date.\n\nFor example, assume that an employee is given the right to purchase 2,000 shares of stock at $20 per share. The options vest 30% per year over three years and have a term of five years. The employee pays $20 per share when buying the stock, regardless of thestock price, over the five-year period.\n\nThere are different types of stock compensation, such asnon-qualified stock options\u00a0(NSOs)andincentive stock options\u00a0(ISOs). ISOs are only available to employees and not non-employee directors or consultants. These options provide special tax advantages. With non-qualified stock options, employees are required to pay income tax based on the grant price minus the price of the exercised option.\n\nStock appreciation rights (SARs)let the value of a predetermined number of shares be paid in cash or shares.Phantom stockpays a cash bonus at a later date equaling the value of a set number of shares.Employee stock purchase plans (ESPPs)let employees buy company shares at a discount.\n\nRestricted stock andrestricted stock units (RSUs)let employees receive shares through purchase or gift after working a set number of years and meeting performance goals.Restricted stockrequires the completion of a vesting period. This may be done all at once after a certain period of time. Alternatively, vesting may be done equally over a set period of years orany other combinationmanagement finds suitable.\n\nRSUs are similar, but they represent the company's promise to pay shares based on a vesting schedule. This offers some advantages to the company, but employees do not gain any rights of stock ownership\u2014such asvoting rights\u2014until the shares are earned and issued.\n\nCompanies awardperformance sharesto executives and managers only if certain specified measures are met. These could include metrics, such as anearnings per share (EPS)target,return on equity (ROE), or the total return of the company's stock in relation to an index. Typically, performance periods are over a multi-year time horizon.\n\nStock options may be exercised by paying cash, exchanging shares already owned, working with a stockbroker on a same-day sale, or executing asell-to-covertransaction. However, a company typically allows only one or two of those methods. For example, private companies typically restrict the sale of acquired shares until the companygoes publicor is sold. In addition, private companies do not offer sell-to-cover or same-day sales.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\"\n\nFidelity. \"Incentive Stock Options (ISOs).\"",
