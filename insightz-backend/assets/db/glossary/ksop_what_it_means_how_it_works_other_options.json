  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA KSOP is a qualified retirement plan that combines anemployee stock ownership plan(ESOP) with a401(k). It is essentially an ESOP that operates within a 401(k). As such, KSOPs are offered by employers to their employees.\n\nCompanies that offer these plans match employee contributions with stock rather than cash. KSOPs are considered defined-benefit plans, as companies that offer them can reduce the administrative expenses of operating separate ESOPs and 401(k) plans.\n\nIndividuals have several options available to them when it comes to retirement planning. If their employer doesn't offer a sponsored plan, they can choose to invest in accounts on their own, such as anindividual retirement account(IRA). But most employers offer some type of retirement plan, such as 401(k)s or403(b)s. Some companies may decide to offer what's called a KSOP, in which an ESOP operates within a 401(k).\n\nESOPs are benefit plans that give employees an ownership stake in the company for which they work. These plans come with certain benefits, including no upfront costs. 401(k)s, on the other hand, are plans that allow individuals to set aside money from their paycheck for retirement.\n\nThe benefits a retiree receives from a KSOP depend on how much they contribute, the employer contributions as well as the way the company's share performs in the market.\n\nThe KSOP provides the features and benefits of both plans by combining them into one. Employees make contributions by setting aside a certain amount of money from their wages through regular payroll deductions. Employers makematching contributions. But rather than contributing cash, the employer instead offers shares in the company.\n\nA KSOP is a great option for companies that can help them create a market for their shares with sufficient liquidity, which measures how easily a stock can be bought or sold in the market. They also incentivize employees to ensure the company's profitability. This could boost the share price and generate additional value down the road. On the flip side, employees could lose value if the share price declines, leaving less incentive to outperform.\n\nKSOPs bring additionalriskto plan holders above and beyond those associated with 401(k)s. Employees with traditional 401(k)s are generally offered several options of funds with various risk and reward profiles in which to invest. As employers gradually add to an employee\u2019s 401(k), the employee has more money to distribute among these funds and diversify their assets.\n\nThere could be a variety of securities within a typical fund, including stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and cash. On the other hand, a KSOP concentrates employee assets in company stock, leaving less room for balance and spreading risk among different shares of stock and asset classes.\n\nThere are other employer-sponsored retirement plans in addition to the KSOP, including the SEP IRA and the SIMPLE IRA.\n\nSEP-IRAs are available for self-employed individuals, such as freelance writers, consultants, and independent contractors. They can also be set up by proprietorships and partnerships. Participants may make tax-deductible contributions on behalf of eligible employees, including the business owner.\n\nEmployers that establish SEP IRAs are allowed to claim atax deductionfor any plan contributions that are not over the statutory limit. However, annual contributions are optional, and if an employer does contribute, they must contribute the same percentage to all eligible employees, up to the contribution limit.\n\nThe contribution for a SEP IRA is the lesser of 25% of compensation or $66,000 for 2023 and $69,000 for 2024.\n\nThe SIMPLE in the nameSIMPLE IRAstands for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. This type of plan is geared toward slightly larger enterprises, including small businesses with 100 or fewer employees.\n\nEmployer contributions are mandatory. They have two options to help boost the retirement savings of their employees; either a 2% contribution or an optional matching contribution of up to 3%. In turn, employees can contribute a maximum of $15,500 in 2023 and $16,000 in 2024. Individuals 50 and over can contribute an additionalcatch-up contributionof $3,500 each year.\n\nThe contribution limit for a 401(k) is $22,500 in 2023 and $23,000 in 2024. If you are 50 and older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 in both years as a catch-up contribution.\n\nIn 2023, the contribution limit for an IRA is $6,500. This increases to $7,000 in 2024. If you are 50 and older, you can contribute an additional $1,000 in both years.\n\nGenerally, a 401(k) is better because it has higher contribution limits, no income qualifications like a Roth IRA, and most employers offer a matching contribution. However, 401(k)s are only offered by employers and not all offer them. If you don't have access to a 401(k), then an IRA is a great alternative. Keep in mind that you can contribute to both a 401(k) and an IRA.\n\nOne of the most popular features of a 401(k) retirement plan is the matching contribution from an employer, which is essentially free money. A KSOP works in the same fashion but rather than the employer matching your contribution with cash, it matches with stock. This helps create liquidity in the market for the company's stock as well as incentivizes employees so that the company does well and the stock price increases.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"COLA Increases for Dollar Limitations on Benefits and Contributions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(k) Limit Increases to $23,000 for 2024, IRA Limit Rises to $7,000.\"",
