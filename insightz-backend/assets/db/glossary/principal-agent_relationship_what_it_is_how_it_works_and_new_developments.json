  "definition": "The principal-agent relationship is a legal, fiduciary relationship in which one party takes on responsibility for acting on behalf of another.\n\nThe principal-agent relationship is a formal relationship at the center of the financial world. The agent acts on behalf of the principal and should not have a conflict of interest in carrying out the act. The relationship between the principal and the agent is referred to as the \"agency\" and the law of agency establishes guidelines for such a relationship.\n\nPlanners giving advice, fund managers investing your capital, and exchange managers overseeing specific markets are all agents acting on your behalf. Grave problems often follow should the relationship go awry. It's thus crucial to understand when investing. Most modern political arrangements involve principals (voters) and agents (representatives), so it's also a major political concern as well.\n\nA principal-agent relationship is often described as implicitly or explicitly contractual. Investors are the principals when they buy shares of an index fund and thefund manageris the agent. The index fund manager must manage the fund which consists of many principals' assets in a way that will maximize returns for a given level of risk following the fund's prospectus.\n\nAgents have an obligation to perform tasks with a certain level of skill and care and may not intentionally or negligently complete the task in an improper manner.\n\nAny willing and able parties can enter into the principal-agent relationship in a legal transaction. The principal within the relationship is an individual who assigns an agent to carry out a task in simple cases. Other such relationships have principals that include corporations, nonprofits, government agencies, or partnerships.\n\nThe agent should be capable of understanding and ultimately carrying out the task assigned by the principal. Common examples include hiring a contractor to complete a repair on a home, retaining an attorney to perform legal work, or asking an investment advisor to diversify a portfolio of stocks.\n\nSome common examples from finance and investing include:\n\nItcreates a fiduciary relationshipbetween the parties involved whether the principal-agent relationship is expressed clearly through a written contract or implied through actions. The agent acting on behalf of the principal must carry out the assigned tasks with the principal's best interest as a priority.\n\nThe agent handles tasks the principal gives provided that the principal provides reasonable instruction. The agent also must perform tasks in a manner that won't intentionally harm the principal. A duty of loyalty is implied within the principal-agent relationship which requires that the agent refrain from putting themself in a position that creates or encourages conflict between their interest and the principal's interest, also known as the principal-agent problem.\n\nTheprincipal-agent problemarises when one party (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal) in a situation where their incentives may not be perfectly aligned and where there's asymmetric information. This concept has become central to modern economic and financial theory. It emerged from the convergence of two lines of study: the examination of how firms actually operate, not just how economics said they did, and academics exploring risk-sharing among groups.\n\nThe study of the principal-agent problem evolved significantly in the late 20th century. As Ronald Coase noted in his seminal 1937 paper \"The Nature of the Firm,\" economists had to focus their analysis at the firm level rather than at the industry level.This shift led to a deeper examination of individual worker incentives and the conflicts that might arise within organizations.\n\nScholars such as Stephen Ross, Michael Jensen, and William Meckling had helped create the study ofagency theoryby the 1970s. Jensen and Meckling published a 1976 paper that gave us the agency definition that most use.\n\nTwo ingredients are necessary for a principal-agent problem to exist, according to agency theorists:\n\nThe problem is obvious when both these conditions are met: The agent has incentives and the ability to act in their interest without immediate accountability.\n\nThe financial sector is particularly susceptible to principal-agent problems because of its complex, interconnected nature and the prevalence of risk-sharing arrangements. Agents clearly often have incentives to take actions that benefit themselves at the expense of the principal in financial relationships, such as excessive risk-taking, short-term focus at the expense of long-term value, or misuse of resources.\n\nA famous survey made headlines in 2013 when it found that many on Wall Street saw unethical conduct daily and that executives were the most likely to think they couldn't get ahead without it.\n\nA 2020 follow-up study to 2010 changes in the investment adviser qualification exam which added sections on adviser ethics found that advisers who passed those sections had fewer reports of misconduct later than those who didn't have to study that area.\n\nThis is why trust is central to investors' relationships with financial advisors, lenders, planners, and others. \"There\u2019s nothing in life we do, no decision we make, that doesn\u2019t have to do with money in some way,\" saidValerie R. Leonard, CEO of EverThrive Financial Group in Birmingham, Alabama. \"If clients don\u2019t believe they can trust you\u2026they will never do business with you.\u00a0It\u2019s really that simple.\"\n\nSo what fosters trust between a client and their financial advisor? \"Throughout my career, I\u2019ve recognized that clients must buy into our relationship before they can buy into my services. They need to know that I genuinely care about them, that they can rely on me to do what I say I\u2019m going to do, and that I\u2019m willing to be open and honest about who I am,\" Leonard said.\n\nAddressing principal-agent problems often involves finding creative ways to alignincentivesand reduce information asymmetry. Standard approaches include the following:\n\nYou'll notice that many of the above have come about in the years since agency theory was introduced. These solutions aim to do more than bolster the trust of clients. They're intended to work when there is none at all.\n\nNew challenges in managing principal-agent problems continue to emerge as financial markets and instruments become increasingly complex, requiring a rethinking of these traditional approaches.\n\nRecent advances in AI andMLare reshaping the landscape of principal-agent relationships in finance, introducing novel challenges for regulators and clients. ML-based trading systems have received significant attention and broader AI applications and regulatory shifts are also transforming how financial institutions operate and are governed.\n\nML-based trading systems are reconfiguring traditional principal-agent relationships. These systems use complex mechanisms likedeep neural networksto develop trading rules that are internally based on data inputs. This shift introduces new forms of knowledge risk such as how much the agent knows about what the principal is doing as well and limits how the principal can change trading when directed by the agent. It obscures the decision rules used by automated systems.\n\nSpecialists have previously suggested more robust contracts to cover issues that might arise or better regulations in this area to address how incentives between principals and agents often diverge. These solutions don't apply in these new spaces.\n\nAs theeconomic sociologistChristian Borsch puts it, \"Conventional solutions to principal-agent problems can't easily address [the issues with ML systems]. For example, given the opacity of these systems, better-designed contracts between the principal and agent or more deterministically construed relationships [that is, computer programmers directing applications] between them offer no viable solutions.\"\n\nNot even computer scientists who develop AI and deep neural networks know precisely how the algorithmic processes arrive at specific decisions or results. Investors have their concerns: 74% of retail investors trust human advice over robo-led advice.\n\nThe issue is \"jarring enough\" regarding the issues raised in finance, as Borsch puts it, but ML systems are also being applied in medicine, where principal-agent relationship issues also arise.\n\nAI has been deployed across various financial services, each with its own principal-agent implications:\n\nThe rise of blockchain technology and DeFi platforms are also said to introduce new issues and potential solutions for classic principal-agent relationships:\n\nThe rise of AI in finance has prompted regulators to reconsider how oversight is done.\n\nThe financial industry is also seeing shifts in how human agents are compensated:\n\nA principal-agent problem is a conflict in priorities or goals between someone who owns an asset, the principal, and the person appointed to control the asset, the agent. Conflicts of interest can cause this problem so carefully designing contracts and setting up regular performance evaluations are key to limiting issues.\n\nA principal may hire an agent and begin a principal-agent relationship for several reasons. One is that the principal may not have enough time to handle any tasks they've given over to the agent for handling. Another is that the agent may have specialized skills that allow them to be more effective at accomplishing a particular task.\n\nFiduciaries accept a legal responsibility to act in the best interest of the person for whom they're working. An agent can face monetary damages if they don't fulfill their fiduciary duty to the principal and act instead in their own interest.\n\nThe principal-agent relationship is a fundamental concept in finance and economics that occurs when one party (the agent) acts on behalf of another (the principal). This arrangement is ubiquitous in the financial world, from corporate executives managing companies for shareholders to fund managers investing on behalf of clients.\n\nThese relationships are essential for the functioning of modern finance but they have the inherent potential for conflicts of interest. The principal-agent problem arises when the agent's incentives don't perfectly align with those of the principal and when the principal can't fully monitor or understand the agent's actions.\n\nRecent technological advances in AI and ML are reshaping these relationships in profound ways. Traditional methods of aligning incentives and ensuring accountability are being challenged as decision-making becomes increasingly automated and opaque.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"What Is a Fiduciary?\"\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Fiduciary Duty.\"\n\nCoase, Ronald. \"The Nature of the Firm,\" Pages 386-405.Economica. vol. 4, no. 16, 1937.\n\nJensen, Michael C. and Meckling, William H. \"Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure.\"Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 3, no. 4, 1976.\n\nSEC Whistleblower Advocate. \"Wall Street in Crisis: A Perfect Storm, A Survey of the US Financial Services Industry.\"\n\nKowaleski, Z.
