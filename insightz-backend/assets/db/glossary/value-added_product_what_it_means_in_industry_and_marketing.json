  "definition": "A value-added product is a saleable commodity that has been enhanced with additional qualities that make it worth a higher price than the raw materials used to make it. It may be made more convenient, more attractive, more palatable, or easier to use than its raw ingredients.\n\nAdding value explains why businesses are able to sell their goods or services for more than they cost to produce.\n\nIn marketing, the added value is a succinct message to the consumer about the characteristics that make a product worth more than its raw ingredients and, just as importantly, why it is preferable to similar products from competitors.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nValue-added is the difference between the price of a product or service and the cost of producing it. The price is determined by what customers are willing to pay based on theirperceived value. Value is added or created in different ways.\n\nThese may include, for instance, extra or special features added by a company or producer to increase the value of a product or service. The addition of value can thus increase the product's price that consumers are willing to pay. For example, offering a year of free tech support on a new computer would be a value-added feature. Individuals can also add value to services they perform, such as bringing advanced skills into the workforce.\n\nConsumers now have access to a whole range of products and services when they want them. As a result, companies constantly struggle to findcompetitive advantagesover each other. Discovering what customers truly value is crucial for what the company produces, packages, markets, and how it delivers its products.\n\nBose Corporation, as an example, has successfully shifted its focus from producing speakers to delivering a \"sound experience,\" or when a BMW car rolls off theassembly line, it sells for a much higher premium over the cost of production because of its reputation for stellar performance, German engineering, and quality parts. Here, the additional advantage has been created through each brand's symbolic value and years of refinement.\n\nThe contribution of private industry or a government sector to overallgross domestic product (GDP)is the value-added of an industry, also referred to as GDP-by-industry. If all stages of production occurred within a country's borders, the total value added at all stages is what is counted in GDP.\n\nThe total value added is themarket priceof the final product or service and only counts production within a specified time period. This is the basis on whichvalue-added tax (VAT)is computed, a system of taxation that's prevalent in Europe.\n\nEconomists can in this way determine how much value an industry contributes to a nation's GDP. Value-added in an industry refers to the difference between the total revenue of an industry and the total cost of inputs\u2014the sum of labor, materials, and services\u2014purchased from other businesses within a reporting period.\n\nThe total revenue or output of the industry consists of sales and otheroperating income, commodity taxes, and inventory change. Inputs that could be purchased from other firms to produce a final product include raw materials, semi-finished goods, energy, and services.\n\nEconomic value-added\u2014also referred to as economic profit or EVA\u2014is thevalue a business generatesfrom its invested capital.\n\nCompanies that build strong brands increase value just by adding their logo to a product. Nike can sell shoes at a much higher price than some of its competitors, even though their production costs may be similar. That's because the Nike brand and its logo, which appears on the uniforms of the top college and professional sports teams, represents a quality enjoyed by elite athletes.\n\nSimilarly, luxury car buyers considering a BMW or Mercedes-Benz are willing to pay a premium price for their vehicles because of the brand reputation and ongoing maintenance programs the companies offer.\n\nAmazon has been a force in the e-retail sector with its automatic refunds for poor service, free shipping, and price guarantees on pre-ordered items. Consumers have become so accustomed to its service that they are willing to pay for Amazon Prime memberships because they value the free two-day turnaround on orders.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"What Is Industry Value Added?\"",
