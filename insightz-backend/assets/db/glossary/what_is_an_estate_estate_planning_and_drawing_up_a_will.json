As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nAn\u00a0estate is everything comprising thenet worthof an individual, including all land and real estate, possessions, financial securities, cash, and otherassetsthat the individual owns or has a controlling interest in.\n\nThe wordestateis colloquially used to refer to all of theland and improvementson a vast property, often some farm or homestead or the historic home of a prominent family. However, in the financial and legal sense of the term, an estate refers to everything of value that an individual owns\u2014real estate, art collections, antique items, investments, insurance, and any other assets and entitlements\u2014and is also used as an overarching way to refer to a person's net worth. Legally, a person's estate\u00a0refers to an individual's total assets minus any liabilities.\n\nThe value of a personal estate is of particular relevance in two cases: if the individual declares bankruptcy and if the individual dies. When an individual debtor declares bankruptcy, their estate is assessed to determine which of their debts they can be reasonably expected to pay. Bankruptcy proceedings involve the same rigorous legal assessment of an estate that also occurs upon an individual's death.\n\nEstates are most relevant upon the death of an individual.Estate planningis the act of managing the division and inheritance of your personal estate and arguably representsthe most important financial planningof an individual's life. It's important to keep in mind that every country has specific rules about passing on wealth, the allowed amounts, and theapproved estate planning trusts.\n\nGenerally, an individual draws up a will that explains the testator's intentions for the distribution of their estate upon their death. A person who receives assets through inheritance is called abeneficiary.\n\nIn almost all cases, estates are divided among members of the deceased's family. This passage of wealth from one generation of a family to the next has a tendency to entrench income in certain social classes or families.\u00a0Inheritance accounts for a massive proportion of total wealth in the United States and around the world\u00a0and is in part responsible for persistent income inequality (though there are, of course, many other factors).\n\nPartially as a response to the stagnation\u00a0of wealth movement as a result of inheritance, most governments require those in line for an inheritance to pay aninheritance tax(estate tax) on the estate. This tax can be very large, sometimes requiring the beneficiary\u00a0to sell some of the inherited assets to pay the tax bill.\n\nIn the U.S., assets of an estate left to a spouse or a charity are generally not taxed.\n\nIt\u00a0is generally advisable for both the individual drafting the will and the beneficiaries of an estate toemploy the services of estate attorneys. Inheritance taxes are notorious for their complexity and exorbitance, and the use of an attorney helps ensure that your inheritance taxes are paid correctly. On the drafting end, several measures can be taken to minimize the amount of tax\u00a0one's beneficiaries will have to pay\u2014for example, setting uptrusts.\n\nAwillis a legal document created to provide instructions on how an individual\u2019s property and custody of minor children, if any, should be handled after death. The individual expresses their wishes through the document and names a trustee orexecutorthat they trust to fulfill the stated intentions. The will also indicates whether a trust should be created after death.\n\nDepending on the estate owner\u2019s intentions, a trust can go into effect during their lifetime (living trust) or after the death of the individual (testamentary trust).\n\nThe authenticity of a will is determined through a legal process known asprobate. Probate is the first step taken in administering the estate of a deceased person anddistributing assets to the beneficiaries. When an individual dies, the custodian of the will must take the will to the probate court or to the executor named in the will, typically within 30 days of the death of the testator. However, it varies by state. For example, Florida requires a will be filed within 10 days of being notified of the death.\n\nThe probate process is a court-supervised procedure in which the authenticity of the will left behind is proven to be valid and accepted as the true last testament of the deceased. The court officially appoints the executor named in the will, which, in turn, gives the executor the legal power to act on behalf of the deceased.\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \u201cIntroduction to Wills.\u201d\n\nFlorida Legislature. \u201c732.901 Production of Wills.\u201d\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \u201cThe Probate Process.\u201d",
