  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe ability-to-pay principle is also known as progressive taxation.\n\nTheability-to-payphilosophy of taxation maintains that taxes should be levied according to an individual's ability to pay. The idea argues people, businesses, and corporations withhigher incomescan and should pay more taxes.\n\nAprogressive taxhas a tax rate that increases or progresses as taxable income increases. It imposes a lower tax rate on low-income earners and a higher rate on those with higher incomes.\u00a0Ability-to-pay taxation argues that those who earn higher incomes should pay a greater percentage of those incomes in taxes than those who earn less.\n\nIn 2024, individuals in the United States with taxableincomeless than $11,600 ($11,925 in tax year 2025) faced a 10% income tax rate, while those with taxable income of more than $609,350 ($626,350 in tax year 2025) faced a rate of 37%, the nation's top individual rate.\u00a0Earnings between those amounts face tax rates as set by income brackets.\n\nThe ideals of ability-to-pay taxation promote the notion that people with more money who pay more taxes are not heavily burdened. To a person earning $1 million a year, $10,000 will make very little difference in their life, while it will make a big difference to a person earning only $60,000 a year.\n\nStandard deductionshelp reduce an individual's taxable income. In 2024, the deduction for single filers is $14,600 and will increase to $15,000 in 2025.\n\nA progressive income tax was endorsed byAdam Smithin 1776. Smith wrote: \u201cThe subjects of every state ought to contribute toward the support of the government, as near as possible, in proportion to their respective abilities; that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state.\"\n\nTo support efforts in World War I, the U.S. passed The Revenue Act of 1918 which codified all tax laws and imposed a progressive income-tax rate structure of up to 77 percent.A progressive tax structure is evident in the tax brackets for the tax year 2025:\n\nAdvocates of ability-to-pay taxation argue that those who have benefitted most from the nation\u2019s way of life in the form of higher incomes and greater wealth can afford and should be obligated to give back more. Tax revenues buildinfrastructure, a strong military, and public schools.\n\nCritics ofprogressive taxationargue that it isfundamentally unfair. They say it penalizes hard work and success and reduces the incentive to make more money. While the U.S. maintains a progressive tax system, tax rates for the wealthy have plummeted over several decades. When President Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, the highest incometax bracket for individuals was 70%.In 2024, the top rate is 37%.\n\nFlat taxes are levied at the same rate for all payers. This is the inverse of the ability-to-pay principle or aregressive taxsystem.\n\nCommon types of taxes include income, corporate, sales, and property taxes. Income tax is levied on an individual's earnings, while corporate tax on a company's. Sales taxes are collected at points of sale. Property taxes are based on the value of a home.\n\nPresident Lincoln passed a revenue-raising measure to pay for Civil War expenses in 1862. It created a Commissioner of Internal Revenue and the United States' first income tax.\n\nAbility-to-pay refers to a principle holding that taxes should be levied according to one's ability to pay them. Higher earners and wealthier individuals pay higher tax rates than those with lower or middle income.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nAdam Smith Works. \"Adam Smith on Fiscal Policy.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Historical Highlights of the IRS.\"\n\nBrookings. \"What We Learned from Reagan\u2019s Tax Cuts.\"",
