  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nEconomic integration is an arrangement among nations that typically\u00a0includes the reduction or elimination of trade barriers and the coordination of monetary andfiscal policies. Economic integration aims to reduce costs for both consumers and producers\u00a0and to increase trade between the countries involved\u00a0in the agreement.\n\nEconomic integration is sometimes referred to as regional integration, as it often occurs among neighboring nations.\n\nWhen regional economies agree on integration, trade barriers fall and economic and political coordination increases.\n\nSpecialists in this area define seven stages of\u00a0economic integration: a preferential trading area, a free trade area, a customs union, a common market, an economic union, an economic and monetary union, and complete economic integration.The final stage represents a total harmonization of fiscal policy and a complete\u00a0monetary union.\n\nThe advantages of economic integration fall into three categories: trade creation,\u00a0employment opportunities,\u00a0and consensus and cooperation.\n\nMore specifically, economic integration typically leads to a reduction in the cost of trade,\u00a0improved availability of goods and services,\u00a0a wider selection of them, and gains in efficiency that lead to greater purchasing power.\n\nEconomic integration can reduce the costs of trade, improve the availability of goods and services, and increase consumer purchasing power in member nations.\n\nEmployment opportunities tend to improve becausetrade liberalizationleads to market expansion, technology sharing,\u00a0and cross-border investment.\n\nPolitical cooperation among countries also can improve because of\u00a0stronger economic ties, which provide an incentive to resolve conflicts peacefully and lead to greater\u00a0stability.\n\nDespite the benefits, economic integration has\u00a0costs. These fall into three categories:\n\nBecause economists and policymakers believe economic integration leads to significant benefits, many institutions attempt to measure\u00a0the degree of economic integration across countries and regions. The methodology for measuring economic integration typically involves multiple economic indicators including trade in goods and services, cross-border capital flows, labor migration,\u00a0and others. Assessing economic integration also includes measures of institutional conformity, such as membership in trade unions and the strength of institutions that protect consumer and investor rights.\n\nThe European Union (EU) was created in 1993 and included 27 member states in 2024. Since 1999, 20 of those nations have adopted the euro as a shared currency.According to data from the World Bank, the EU accounted for roughly 16.6% of the world's gross domestic product in 2022.\n\nThe United Kingdom voted in 2016 to leave the EU. In January 2020, British lawmakers and the European Parliament voted to accept the United Kingdom's withdrawal. The UK officially split from the EU on January 1, 2021.\n\nThere are numerous examples of economic integration around the world. In North America, the United States\u2013Mexico\u2013Canada Agreement (USCMA) is an example of a free trade agreement between the three countries. TheAsia-Pacific Economic Cooperationis a forum of 21 Pacific Rim countries aimed at fostering free trade across the region. As mentioned above, the EU is another such example of economic integration, as is theEurasian Economic Union(EAEU).\n\nEconomic integration can come with downsides and risks. Primarily, countries participating in regional integration may have divergent priorities when it comes to fiscal and monetary policy. Resolving such conflicts can be challenging and costly in terms of time and resources. In addition, economic integration can create a system in which a select group of stakeholders reap the economic benefits, such as more revenue from trade, while others bear the costs, such as job market shifts. These are important considerations to weigh when assessing the value of economic integration.\n\nEconomic integration can increase trade, benefiting both producers, consumers, and involved countries. For instance, with the elimination of trade barriers, a firm may be able to produce and sell more products, earning more revenue, and increasing their home country'sgross domestic product (GDP). For customers in other countries, they can count on having more product selection and potentially lower costs, as well.\n\nEconomic integration is a form of coordination between different states, in which barriers to trade are eliminated and fiscal and monetary policies are harmonized. These arrangements can lead to increased economic activity, job creation, and stronger political ties. They may also come with drawbacks, such as trade diversion and loss of national sovereignty.\n\nThe EU is a well-known example of regional economic integration, as it is comprised of 27 member states, 20 of which use the same currency.\n\nPressbooks. \"Core Principles of International Marketing: 2.4 Regional Economic Integration.\"\n\nAllianz Global Investors. \"Allianz Global Investors Insights.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"Official EU Currency.\"\n\nThe World Bank Group. \"GDP (Current US$) - European Union, World.\"\n\nLibrary of Congress. \"BREXIT: Sources of Information.\"",
