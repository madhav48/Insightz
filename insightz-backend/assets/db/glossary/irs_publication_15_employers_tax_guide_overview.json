  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nIRS Publication 15: Employer's Tax Guide is a document published by theInternal Revenue Servicedetailing an employer's responsibilities for filing and reporting tax information. The document covers thewithholding, depositing, reporting, paying, and correcting of taxes for employees (although not for the corporation itself). IRS Publication 15 is also referred to as Circular E.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIRS Publication 15 is used to determinefederal income tax, but not state orlocal taxes. The Tax Guide details federal income tax amounts for payroll withholdings, includingMedicareand Social Security amounts.\ufeff\ufeff Employers should refer to their state's tax rules to ensure that proper state income tax amounts are withheld from employees' paychecks. Extra tax information is also available in IRS Publication 15-A.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nPreviously, one of the most important features contained in the Employer\u2019s Tax Guide was the Percentage Method Tables and Wage Bracket Method Tables for Income Tax Withholding.\ufeff\ufeff However, for the 2020 Employer's Tax Guide, these withholding tables have been removed. These tables\u2014and the employer instructions on how to figure employee withholding\u2014are now included in Publication 15-T, Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods. The IRS also provides an assistant on their website, called the Income Tax Withholding Assistant for Employers, to help employers figure out employee withholding.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThese wage bracket tables help an employer to know exactly which percentage of their employees\u2019 payroll they should bewithholdingfor taxes every pay period in order to comply with federal tax regulations. In order to determine the tax withholding amount, an employee must also file aW-4 Form, which can be updated as situations change in the employee\u2019s life, such as a new family member.\ufeff\ufeff In the event that an employee does not file a W-4, the Employer\u2019s Tax Guide also details what amount to withhold instead.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe easiest way to access IRS Publication 15 is typically online through the IRS website.
