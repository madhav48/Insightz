She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nNet debtper capitais a measurement of the value of a government's debt expressed in terms of the amount attributable to each citizen under the government's jurisdiction.\n\nThe level of net debt per capita can be a factor to consider when analyzing a government's ability to continue to pay its debt service costs through its current levels of tax revenue.\n\nNet debt per capita is how much debt a government has per citizen. It is most often calculated at the national level, but it can also be applied to state and city governments.\n\nThis number is sometimes used to help evaluate thedefault riskof a government's bonds as well as to assess its overall economic health.\n\nNet debt per capita is a simple calculation to perform. The formula is:\n\nNet Debt Per Capita = (Short-Term Debt + Long-Term Debt \u2013 Cash & Cash Equivalents)/Population\n\nFor example, if a country with a population of 300 million people has a total debt of $950 billion and cash of $20 billion, its net debt per capita is:\n\nNet Debt Per Capita = ($950 Billion \u2013 $20 Billion)/300 Million = $3,100\n\nThese numbers can usually be obtained without the effort of gathering the data and calculating it. Many public sources and economic think tanks regularly publish the figures.\n\n...The U.S. national debt at the start of 2024. The figure is updated daily on the U.S. Treasury site. Ten years earlier it was $22.99 trillion.\n\nTheoretically, the net debt per capital number means that each taxpayer would have to pay the government $3,100 if it had to pay off its debt in full. This is assuming, of course, that every citizen became liable for the outstanding debt of the country, which wouldn't happen in practice.\n\nNet debt per capita is simply an indicator by which to measure a country's financial health rather than an actual approximation of individual liability.\n\nNet debt per capita is more commonly used for political statements than as an economic indicator in and of itself. Expressing the national debt in terms of a citizen's share makes it more real and relevant.\n\nAs of Jan. 6, 2024, the net debt per capita of the United States is $102,409. Countries with higher net debt per capita include the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. Japan has a relatively light debt load.\n\nThese figures are generally used in domestic politics to push for some change infiscal policy. That said, net debt per capita may be plotted againstper capita GDPto compare several regions around the world to determine the most promising areas to invest in internationally. However, thedebt to GDP ratiois more commonly used for this purpose as it simplifies two data sets into a single plotted line for each country. This makes visualization and comparison much easier.\n\nThe national debt of the U.S. is about $34 trillion as of the start of 2024.\n\nThe population of the U.S. is about 332 million.\n\nThat makes the national debt per capita of all Americans about $102,409.\n\nThe U.S. national debt stands at about $34 trillion as of early 2024. Ten years earlier, it was $22.99 trillion. . at the start of 2024. The figure is updated daily on the U.S. Treasury site. Ten years earlier it was $22.99 trillion. Much of the increase can be attributed to the coronavirus pandemic and the enormous amounts of government money spent by both President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden to stabilize the American economy and help citizens through the crisis.\n\nYes. Several nations have little or no debt. They include:\n\nNational debt per capita is largely a political talking point. It helps communicate a government's level of indebtedness so that its citizens can understand it more fully.\n\nTheoretically, every man, woman, and child in the U.S. would have to pay the U.S. government $102,409 to wipe out the national debt. Practically speaking, that's not going to happen.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"What is the national debt?\"\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"What is the national debt?\"\n\nClear Finances. \"10 Countries without Public Debt.\"",
