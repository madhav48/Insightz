  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA tax holiday is a temporary tax break. In the United States, tax holidays often suspend state and local sales taxes paid by consumers.\n\nGovernments also use tax holidays as investment incentives\u2014for example, by exempting a new plant from property taxes for a number of years.\n\nWhen a government wants to encourageconsumer spendingor business investment, it may offer a tax holiday\u2014a temporary period during which certain taxes are reduced or lifted altogether.\n\nTax holidays may also seek to offset the effect of market-based increases in prices. This was the case withgas taxholidays instituted by some states and advocated by President Joseph Biden in 2022 in response to sharply higher prices at the pump.\n\nSome tax holidays have become an annual tradition. For example, some state and local governments in the U.S. offer asales taxholiday the weekend before school resumes in the fall to reduce parents' outlays for school supplies.\n\nThe goal is to increase store traffic, which can boost overall spending. States declaring a tax holiday may also hope to draw consumers from other nearby states.\n\nNational or local governments may also offer a tax holiday for businesses to foster growth.Developing countriessometimes use tax holidays to attract foreign investment.\n\nTax holidays focused on business investment may be defined based on the location of the investment, as with the Opportunity Zones created by theTax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. These defer capital gains taxes on funds reinvested in qualifying projects within designated low-income areas.\n\nAlternatively, business investment tax holidays may target particular companies or industries. For example, the state of Wisconsin initially offered $2.85 billion in tax credits to Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn. However, it scaled that back to $80 million when Foxconn failed to follow through on plans to invest $10 billion in a new plant in the state.\n\nIn the past, researchers found that sales tax holidays led households to increase purchases of children's clothing and shoes by more than 49% and 45%, respectively.Others have concluded more recently that the regressive nature of sales taxes on lower-income families throughout the year overrides the benefits they may obtain from a few annual holidays.\n\nThe net benefit of tax holidays is still up for debate. On the one hand, even though the government loses out on tax revenues that would have been generated from sales during the tax holiday, such tax breaks may increase revenue over the long term because they stimulate spending and investment.\n\nIn addition, the lost tax revenue may be offset by consumers' increased purchases of items in product categories that are not affected by the tax holiday.\n\nOn the other hand, increased sales during a tax holiday may be preceded by reduced sales because consumers know they'll save money by waiting. Thus, the tax holiday simply shifts sales that would have happened before or after the holiday to the holiday dates.\n\nOne study found that a weekend-long broad sales tax holiday in Massachusetts increased spending in the state over the entire month and relative to that in neighboring states.\n\nSome retailers may take advantage of tax holidays by raising their prices, effectively pocketing some of the subsidy intended for consumers.\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, retailer groups have been among the strongest advocates of sales tax holidays, while lawmakers in several of the states that have offered them in the recent past have grown more skeptical of the concept.\n\nThat depends largely on the customary sales taxes in the state or locality where you're shopping. A few states, such as Delaware and Oregon, have no state sales tax at all. Others, including California and Rhode Island, charge 7% or more. When local sales taxes are added, total sales taxes in some areas can top 9%.\n\nThe most common items subject to tax holidays in the U.S. include clothing, footwear, school supplies, and computers. Some states single out other products such as firearms and firearm accessories (Mississippi), generators and air conditioners (Texas), or sports equipment (West Virginia).\n\nState tax holidays generally last from two to seven days, according to a list compiled by the Federation of Tax Administrators. A few states, like Florida and Tennessee, have month-long or longer tax holidays.\n\nTax policy can certainly affect consumption and investment. The notion that a sales tax break on some or all consumer goods for a few days in a year could permanently increase sales and prosperity has been a harder sell, despite its obvious attractions for retailers, shoppers, and politicians.\n\nBusiness investment tax breaks invite neighboring jurisdictions to offer incentives of their own in abeggar-thy-neighborrace to the bottom, while risking sweetheart deals for favored businesses from friendly politicians.\n\nA tax holiday may provide a temporary economic boost but it is not the proverbialfree lunch.\n\nThe White House. \"Fact Sheet: President Biden Calls for a Three-Month Federal Gas Tax Holiday.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Sales Tax Holiday by State.\"\n\nReuters. \"Foxconn Mostly Abandons $10 Billion Wisconsin Project Touted by Trump.\"\n\nSocial Science Research Network. \"The Effect of Sales Tax Holidays on Household Consumption Patterns.\"\n\nInstitute on Taxation and Economic Policy. \"Sales Tax Holidays: An Ineffective Alternative to Real Sales Tax Reform.\"\n\nFederal Reserve System. \"The Effect of Sales-Tax Holidays on Consumer Spending.\"\n\nStateline. \"In Some States, Sales Tax Holidays Lose Luster.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"State and Local Sales Tax Rates, Midyear 2024.\"\n\nFederation of Tax Administrators. \"2024 State Sales Tax Holidays.\"",
