  "definition": "Full employment exists when all willing and available skilled and unskilled labor is being used.\n\nFull employment is an economic situation where all workers and laborers who want to work are employed, making it the most efficient employment circumstance possible.\n\nTrue full employment is probably unachievable because it is a situation in which anyone who is willing and able to work can find a job, and unemployment is zero. It is a theoretical goal for economic policymakers to aim for rather than an actually observed state of an economy. In practical terms, economists can define various levels of full employment that are associated with low but non-zero rates of unemployment.\n\nFull employment is considered the ideal employment rate within an economy, where no workers are involuntarily unemployed. Full employment of labor is one component of an economy that is operating at its full productive potential and producing at a point along itsproduction possibilities frontier. If there is any unemployment, then the economy is not producing at full potential, and some improvement in economic efficiency may be possible.\n\nHowever, because it may not be practically possible to eliminate all unemployment from all sources, full employment may not actually be attainable. For many economists, newer understandings of full employment require some degree of unemployment to temper inflation and allow workers to move between jobs, pursue their education, or improve their skills.\n\nAn unemployment rate of 5% is often considered full employment. This level of unemployment is enough to minimize inflation and allow workers to move between jobs, but those wanting full-time work should be able to find a full-time job (even if it is not their preferred occupation).\n\nIn terms of cyclical unemployment, many macroeconomic theories present full employment as a goal that, once attained, often results in an inflationary period. The link between inflation and unemployment is a prominent part of Monetarist and Keynesian theories. This inflation is a result of workers having more disposable income, which would drive prices upward, according to the concept of thePhillips curve.\n\nThis poses a potential problem for economic policymakers, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, that have a dual mandate to achieve and maintain both stable prices and full employment.If, in fact, there is a trade-off between employment and inflation, as per the Phillips curve, then achieving simultaneous full employment and price stability may not be possible.\n\nOn the other hand, some economists also argue against the overzealous pursuit of full employment, especially via the over-expansion of money and credit through monetary policy. Economists of theAustrian Schoolbelieve that this will result in damaging distortions to the financial and manufacturing sectors of the economy. This might even result in more unemployment in the long run by precipitating a subsequent recession as real resource constraints come into conflict with artificially increased demand for various types of capital goods and complementary labor.\n\nUnemployment can result from cyclical, structural, frictional, or institutional causes. Policymakers can focus on reducing the underlying causes of each type of unemployment, but in doing so, they may face trade-offs against other policy goals.\n\nThe desire to encourage technological progress can causestructural unemployment. For example, when workers find themselves obsolete due to the automation of factories or the use of artificial intelligence.\n\nInstitutional unemployment arises from institutional policies that affect the economy. These can include governmental programs that promote social equity and offer generous safety net benefits, as well as labor market phenomena such as unionization and discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nSome unemployment may be unavoidable by policymakers entirely, such asfrictional unemployment, which is caused by workers voluntarily changing jobs or entering the workforce. Searching for a new job, recruiting new employees, and matching the right worker to the right job are all a part of it.\n\nCyclical unemploymentis the fluctuating type of unemployment that rises and falls within the normal course of the business cycle. This unemployment rises when an economy is in a recession and falls when an economy is growing.Therefore, for an economy to be at full employment, it cannot be in a recession that\u2019s causing cyclical unemployment.\n\nThe Phillips curve is cyclical. It posits that full employment inevitably results in higher inflation, which in turn leads to increasing unemployment.\n\nFor the most part,macroeconomicpolicymakers focus on reducing cyclical unemployment to move the economy toward full employment. In this case, they may face trade-offs against rising inflation or the risk of distorting other sectors of the economy.\n\nCyclical unemployment, which is driven by changes in economic cycles, should not be confused with \"seasonal unemployment,\" where there are changes in the workforce that predictably occur throughout the year, For example, jobs in the retail sector typically decrease after the traditional run-up to the holiday shopping season ends after New Year's. Unemployment rises when people hired for the holidays are no longer needed to meet demand.\n\nDue to the difficulty and questionable desirability of achieving true full employment, economists have developed other, more pragmatic goals for economic policy.\n\nThe natural rate of unemployment represents only the amount of unemployment due to structural and frictional factors in labor markets. The natural rate serves as an achievable approximation of full employment while accepting that technological change and the normal transaction costs of labor markets will always mean some modest unemployment at any given point.\n\nThenon-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU)represents the rate of unemployment that is consistent with a low, stable rate of price inflation. The NAIRU is useful as a policy target for economic policymakers who operate under a dual mandate to balance full employment and stable prices.\n\nThis is not full employment, but it is the closest the economy can be to full employment without excessive upward pressure on prices from increasing wages. Modern economists often refer to the NAIRU when discussing full employment.Note that the NAIRU only makes sense conceptually and as a policy target if and when there is indeed a stable trade-off between unemployment and inflation, as posited by the Phillips curve.\n\nFull employment can provide numerous benefits to both individuals and the overall social and economic balance of a country. As employment increases toward full employment, benefits include:\n\nFull employment is a theoretical condition. As a result, there are no real-world examples of full employment. Countries work to increase employment as much as possible and lower the rate of unemployment.\n\nHowever, there are examples of what economists consider full employment, which is when a country's unemployment is as close to zero as real-world conditions allow without triggering inflation or other economic hardships. In general, full employment in the real world is often considered to be 95% employment in an economy.\n\nBy the end of 2024, there were 95 countries whose reported unemployment rates could be considered full employment. These included Bahrain (1.1%), Benin (1.7%), Cuba (1.5%), Germany (3.4%), Japan (2.6%), Malta (2.7%), Mexico (2.7%), the Netherlands (3.6%), Norway (4%), Poland (2.5%), and Thailand (0.7%).\n\nIn the United States, the unemployment rate was 4.1% in January 2025. The lowest unemployment rate in the U.S. since 1948 was 2.5% in 1953.Both of these rates would be considered full employment by economists.\n\nUnemployment numbers, however, do not account for those who have dropped out of the workforce entirely because they have stopped looking for work, even if they would prefer to have a job, or for those who are working part-time but would prefer full-time work. Under true full employment conditions, anyone who wanted to find a full-time job would be able to.\n\nMany economists consider an unemployment rate of 5% or lower to be maximum employment, or as close to full employment as is possible in the real world. This means that the rate of full employment is 95% or above.\n\nIn the United States, the Bureau of Labor Statistics considers full employment to be: An unemployment rate equal to the NAIRU with no cyclical unemployment, when the country's GDP is at its potential.For many countries, these conditions are met when the unemployment rate is at 5% or lower.\n\nFull employment and zero unemployment are not the same thing in the real world. Some types of unemployment are unavoidable or even necessary. Natural unemployment levels prevent inflation, allow workers to move between jobs, or give people the chance to improve their education or job skills. Industries and companies also evolve, which alters the available job opportunities. This process is ultimately beneficial to the economy, even if it temporarily leaves some workers unemployed.\n\nFull employment is when all available labor resources are being used in the most efficient way possible without triggering inflation. It is a theoretical state in which anyone who wants to find full-time work can do so, and the unemployment rate is at 0%.\n\nMany modern economists agree that some unemployment is necessary to avoid inflation. Temporary unemployment can also allow workers time to move between jobs, go to school, or otherwise improve their skills. In the real world, an unemployment rate of 5% or lower is often considered full employment. This level of unemployment prevents inflation and lets workers move between jobs, but it is low enough that those wanting full-time work should be able to find some kind of full-time job.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Full Employment: An Assumption Within BLS Projections.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"What Economic Goals Does the Federal Reserve Seek to Achieve Through Its Monetary Policy?\"\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency. \"The World FactBook, Unemployment Rate.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Top Picks,\" Select \"Unemployment Rate,\" Click \"Retrieve Data,\" Select \"1948 to 2025,\" Click \"Go.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Richmond. \"Full Employment.\"",
