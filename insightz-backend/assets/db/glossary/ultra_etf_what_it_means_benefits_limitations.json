  "term": "Ultra ETF: What It Means, Benefits, Limitations",
  "definition": "An ultra ETF is a class ofexchange-traded fund (ETF)that employsleveragein an effort to amplify the return of a set benchmark. Since first arriving on the scene in 2006, ultra ETFs have grown to include different ETFs with underlying benchmarks ranging from broad market indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, to specific sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and basic materials. Ultra ETFs are also known asleveraged ETFsor geared funds.\n\nETFs are funds that invest in a basket ofsecuritiesfrom theindexthat they track. They generally aim to achieve the same returns as their benchmark by replicating its holdings, offering investors the opportunity to mimic the performance of the broader equity market or, in other cases, gain complete exposure to a specific sector or trend.\n\nA traditional\u00a0exchange-traded fund\u00a0usually tracks the securities in its underlying index on a one-to-one basis, meaning that if, for example, the S&P moves 1 percent, an S&P ETF will also move by 1 percent.Alternative ones, often referred to as ultra ETFs, seek to be more aggressive. These marketable securities usefinancial derivativesand debt to amplify returns, offering to double, triple, or more thelongor short performance of a given underlying index.\n\nLeveraging is an investing strategy that involves using borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price movements.\n\nIncreased dailyvolatilityis both the biggest benefit and greatest danger of ultra ETFs. They are best suited to short-term investing strategies or quicktradingto maximize a given bet in the market\u2014due to the high-risk, high-cost structure of ultra ETFs, they are rarely used as long-term investments.\n\nAccording to theprospectusesfor these funds, ultra ETFs may not achieve double or more the return of the benchmark duringflatmarkets. Long-term returns may also diverge from the desired performance target.\u00a0The ultra ETFs' only aim is to amplify the daily return\u2014a goal they have succeeded in fairly accurately in the short time they can be analyzed.\n\nThe total assets of the ProShares UltraPro QQQ, which offers 3x leverage. As of\n\nDecember 2023, it is the largest leveraged ETF in the U.S. market, according to VettaFi.\n\nUltra ETFs can achieve leverage in a few different ways. The strategies below are meant to amplify the potential returns of the underlying index or asset class.\n\nIf an investor is convinced that the S&P 500 is about to rise, they will probably want to explore ways to make as much money as possible from this conviction. An ultra ETF can cater to those needs, without incurring the additional expenses and stress of trading onmargin\u2014a process whereby a broker lends money to customers so that they can purchase stocks or other securities with the securities held ascollateralfor the loan.\n\nUltra ETFs can be beneficial to tactical investors who are short oncapitalor allocation space within a diversifiedportfolio. For instance, they can invest 5 percent of their portfolios into an ultra ETF and gain closer to 10 percent exposure due to the leveraged returns.\n\nLeverage is a double-edged sword: It can lead to significant gains, as well as significant losses. The use of leverage magnifies not only the return potential of these ETFs, but also thestandard deviation, making these investments riskier than non-leveraged ETFs targeting the same index or investment style.\u00a0In other words, these vehicles are not for the average investor.\n\nUltra ETFs represent just a small portion of the total ETF universe, accounting for approximately $73.63 billion, or 4.30 percent of the $1.71 trillion total ETF market as of December 2023.\n\nAnyone looking to make long-term, buy and hold investments should also steer clear of ultra ETFs. Daily rebalancing andcompounding, combined with leverage, will cause investment results to\u00a0diverge significantly over time\u00a0from expectations.This is due to the wide variance of performance that make standard performance measures such as thegeometric meanof limited use.\n\nPotential payoffs can be significantly impaired by charges, too. Because of their complexity and use of borrowed funds, ultra ETFs carry much higherexpense ratiosthan standard ETFs. The average fee for regular ETFs is roughly 0.5 percent, or $5.00 for every $1,000 invested in 2023.Ultra ETFs, on the other hand, usually come with expense ratios of 1% or more.\n\nUltra ETFs also enable investors to amplify their returns whenshorting, or betting against, an underlying index. Inverse ultra ETFs, or ultra shorts,use leverage to make extra money when a market declines in value. When used properly, they allow sophisticated investors tohedgeexisting long positions with short exposure.\n\nThere are potentially greater tax implications to consider when investing in ultra ETFs. Ultra ETFs buy and sell their underlying securities more frequently, so when the fund realizes capital gains, they may be passed onto shareholders as capital gain distributions. Should these arise due to rebalancing, this may create short-term capital gains.\n\nIt is important to understand that ultra ETFs may be able to be held in tax-advantaged accounts such as IRAs. However, be mindful that these ETFs often have higher volatility and risk. If you lose your capital from investing in an ultra ETF, it may not be possible to recapture that tax-advantage benefit (i.e. you're limited in what you can contribute to your IRA each year).\n\nThe primary goal of ultra ETFs is to provide traders with the opportunity to capitalize on short-term market movements and amplify potential gains. These ETFs are typically used for tactical trading and often not for long-term investment strategies.\n\nUltra ETFs can track a wide range of assets and indexes, including equity indices, commodities, fixed-income instruments. Some popular ultra ETFs are linked to major stock market indices such as the S&P 500, gold, or oil.\n\nYes, there are alternatives to ultra ETFs for achieving leveraged exposure. These alternatives include options contracts, leveraged mutual funds, and leveraged index funds.\n\nUltra ETFs, also known as leveraged ETFs, are specialized exchange-traded funds designed to provide amplified exposure to an underlying index or asset class. They achieve this leverage through the use of financial derivatives, allowing them to aim for double or triple the daily returns of the underlying benchmark. Note that ultra ETFs are generally more suitable for short-term investments and most often not deployed in long-term hold strategies.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Exchange-Traded Funds and Products: Types.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"The Lowdown on Leveraged and Inverse Exchange-Traded Products.\"\n\nVettaFi. \"US Leveraged Equity ETF List.\"\n\nETF.com. \"Total Market ETF Overview.\"\n\nETF.com. \"Leveraged ETF Overview.\"",
