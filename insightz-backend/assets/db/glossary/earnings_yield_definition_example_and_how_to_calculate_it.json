  "term": "Earnings Yield: Definition, Example, and How To Calculate It",
  "definition": "The earnings yield refers to theearnings per sharefor the most recent 12-month period divided by the current market price per share. The earnings yield (the inverse of theP/E ratio) shows the percentage of a company's earnings per share. Earnings yield is used by many investment managers to determine optimalasset allocationsand is used by investors to determine which assets seem underpriced or overpriced.\n\nMoney managers often compare the earnings yield of a broadmarket index(such as theS&P 500) to prevailing interest rates, such as the current 10-yearTreasury yield. If the earnings yield is less than the rate of the 10-yearTreasuryyield, stocks may be considered overvalued. If the earnings yield is higher, stocks may be considered undervalued relative tobonds.\n\nEconomic theory suggests that investors in equities should demand an extrarisk premiumof several percentage points above prevailingrisk-free rates(such as rates onTreasury bills) in their earnings yield to compensate them for the higher risk of owning stocks over bonds.\n\nEarnings yield as aninvestment valuation metricis not as widely used as the P/E ratio. Earnings yield can be helpful when there is concern about the rate of return on investment. However, for equity investors, earning periodic investment income may be secondary to growing their investment values over time. This is why investors may refer to value-based investment metrics such as the P/E ratio more often than earnings yield when making stock investments. That said, the metrics provide the same information, just in a different way.\n\nFor investors looking to invest in stocks with stabledividend income, earnings yield can offer a direct look into the level of return dividend stocks may generate. In this case, earnings yield is more of areturn metric,revealing how much an investment may earn for investors rather than avaluation metricshowing how investors value the investment. However, a valuation metric like the P/E ratio can affect a return metric like earnings yield.\n\nAnovervaluedinvestment can lower earnings yield, while anundervaluedinvestment can raise earnings yield. This is because the higher the stock price goes without a comparable rise in earnings, the lower the earnings yield will drop. If the stock price falls but earnings stay the same or rise, the earnings yield will increase.Value investorsseek the latter scenario.\n\nThe inverse relationship between earnings yield and the P/E ratio indicates that the more valuable an investment, the lower the earnings yield, and the less valuable an investment, the higher the earnings yield. However, investments with strong valuations and high P/E ratios might generate lower earnings over time and eventually boost their earnings yield, and this is whatgrowth investorslook for. On the other hand, investments with weak valuations and low P/E ratios may generate lower earnings over time and, in the end, drag down their earnings yield.\n\nEarnings yield can help investors assess whether or not they want to buy or sell a stock.\n\nIn April of 2019, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, was trading near $175 with 12-month earnings of $7.57, which produced an earnings yield of 4.3%. This was historically high as the yield had been 2.5% or lower before 2018. Between 2016 and 2017, the stock increased by more than 70%, while the earnings yield increased from approximately 1% to 2.5%.\n\nThe stock fell more than 40% off its 2018 high, while the earnings yield was near its highest historical level, about 3%. After the decline, the earnings yield continued to creep higher as the price fell, reaching over 5% in early 2019 when the stock started to bounce back higher.\n\nThe increased earnings yield may have played a role in driving the stock higher, mainly because investors expected earnings to improve going forward. A high earnings yield (relative to prior readings) didn't prevent the stock from seeing a significant decline in 2018.\n\nEarnings yield may also be helpful in a stock that is older and has more consistent earnings. If growth is expected to be low for the foreseeable future, the earnings yield can be used to determine when it is a good time to buy the stock in its cycle. A higher than typical earnings yield can indicate the stock may beoversoldand could be due for a bounce higher, assuming no negative news has occurred within the company.\n\nNasdaq. \"FB Revenue EPS.\" Accessed Feb. 13, 2022.\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Meta Platforms, Inc.
