  "definition": "The debt-to-capital ratio is a measurement of a company's financial leverage. The debt-to-capital ratio is calculated by taking the company's interest-bearing debt, both short- and long-term liabilities and dividing it by the total capital. Total capital is all interest-bearing debt plusshareholders' equity, which may include items such as common stock, preferred stock, and minority interest.\n\n\ufeffDebt-To-Capital\u00a0Ratio=DebtDebt+Shareholders\u2032Equity\\text{Debt-To-Capital Ratio} = \\frac{Debt}{Debt \\text{ }+\\text{ } Shareholders'\\ Equity}Debt-To-Capital\u00a0Ratio=Debt+Shareholders\u2032EquityDebt\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe debt-to-capital ratio is calculated by dividing a company\u2019s total debt by its total capital, which is total debt plus total shareholders\u2019 equity.\n\nThe debt-to-capital ratio gives analysts and investors a better idea of a company's\u00a0financial structure\u00a0and whether or not the company is a suitable investment. All else being equal, the higher the debt-to-capital ratio, the riskier the company. This is because a higher ratio, the more the company is funded by debt than equity, which means a higher liability to repay the debt and a greater risk of forfeiture on the loan if the debt cannot be paid timely.\n\nHowever, while a specific amount of debt may be crippling for one company, the same amount could barely affect another. Thus, using total capital gives a more accurate picture of thecompany's healthbecause it frames debt as a percentage of capital rather than as a dollar amount.\n\nAs an example, assume a firm has $100 million in liabilities comprised of the following:\n\nOf these, only notes payable, bonds payable, and long-term liabilities are interest-bearing securities, the sum of which total $5 million + $20 million + $55 million = $80 million.\n\nAs for equity, the company has $20 million worth of preferred stock and $3 million of minority interest listed on the books. The company has 10 million shares of common stock outstanding, which is currently trading at $20 per share. Total equity is $20 million + $3 million + ($20 x 10 million shares) = $223 million. Using these numbers, the calculation for the company's debt-to-capital ratio is:\n\nAssume this company is being considered as an investment by a portfolio manager. If the portfolio manager looks at another company that had a debt-to-capital ratio of 40%, all else equal, the referenced company is a safer choice since itsfinancial leverageis approximately half that of the compared company's.\n\nAs a real-life example, consider Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT), which has $36.6 billion in total debt as of December 2018.Its shareholders\u2019 equity for the same quarter was $14 billion.Thus, its debt-to-capital ratio is 72%, or $36.6 billion / ($36.6 billion + $14 billion).\n\nUnlike the debt-to-capital ratio, thedebt ratiodivides total debt by total assets. The debt ratio is a measure of how much of a company\u2019s assets are financed with debt. The two numbers can be very similar, as total assets are equal to total liabilities plus total shareholder\u2019 equity. However, for the debt-to-capital ratio, it excludes all other liabilities besides interest-bearing debt.\n\nThe debt-to-capital ratio may be affected by the accounting conventions a company uses. Often, values on a company's financial statements are based on historical cost accounting and may not reflect the true current market values. Thus, it is very important to be certain the correct values are used in the calculation, so the ratio does not become distorted.\n\nCaterpillar. \"10-K Annual Report 2018,\" Page 46.
