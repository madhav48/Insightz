  "definition": "Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight\n\nFinancial distress is a condition in which a company or individual cannot generate sufficient revenues or income, making it unable to meet or pay its financial obligations. This is generally due to high fixed costs, a large degree of illiquid assets, or revenues sensitive to economic downturns. For individuals, financial distress can arise from poor budgeting, overspending, too high of a debt load, lawsuit, or loss of employment.\n\nIgnoring the signs of financial distress before it gets out of control can be devastating. There may come a time when severe financial distress can no longer be remedied because the company or individual's obligations have grown too high and cannot be repaid. If this happens,bankruptcymay be the only option.\n\nIf a company or individual experiences a period of time when it cannot pay its debts, bills, and other obligations by their due date, they are likely experiencing financial distress.\n\nExamples of a firm's expenses that must be paid may include financing such as paying interest on debts,opportunity costsof projects, and employees who aren't productive. Employees of a distressed firm usually have lower morale and higher stress caused by the increased chance of bankruptcy, which could force them out of their jobs. Companies under financial distress may find it difficult to secure newfinancing. They may also find the market value of the firm falls significantly, as customers cut back on new orders, and suppliers change their terms of delivery.\n\nLooking at a company'sfinancial statementscan help investors and others determine its current and future financial health. For example,negative cash flowsappearing in the company's cash flow statement is one red flag of financial distress. This could be caused by a large disparity between cash payments and receivables, high interest payments, or adrop in working capital.\n\nIndividuals who experience financial distressmay find themselves in a situation where their debt servicing costs are much more than their monthly income. These debts or obligations include items such as home or rent payments, car payments, credit cards, and utility bills. People who experience situations like these tend to go through it for an extended period of time and may ultimately be forced to relinquish assets secured by their debts and lose their home or car, or face eviction.\n\nIndividuals who experience financial distress may be subject to wage garnishments, judgments, or legal action from creditors.\n\nThere are multiple warning signs that could indicate a company is experiencing financial distress, or is about to in the near-term. Poor profits may point to a company that is financially unhealthy. Struggling to break even suggests a business that cannot sustain itself by generating internal funds and must instead raise capital externally. This increases the company\u2019sbusiness riskand lowers its creditworthiness with lenders, suppliers, investors, and banks. Limiting access to funds typically results in a company (or individual) failing.\n\nDeclining sales or poor sales growth indicates that demand is not there for a company\u2019s products or services based on its existing business model. When expensive marketing campaigns result in no growth, consumers may no longer be satisfied with their offerings and the company may be forced to close down. Likewise, if a company offers poor quality products or services, consumers will start buying from competitors, eventually forcing a business to close its doors as well.\n\nWhen debtors take too much time paying their debts to the company,cash flowmay be severely stretched. The business or individual may beunable to pay its own liabilities. The risk is especially enhanced when a company has just one or two major customers.\n\nAs difficult as it may seem, there are some ways to turn things around and remedy financial distress. One of the first things many companies do is to review their business plans. This should include both its operations and performance in the market, as well as setting up a target date to accomplish all its goals.\n\nAnother consideration is where to cut costs. This may include cutting staff or even cutting back on management incentives, which can often be costly to a business's bottom line.\n\nSome companies may consider restructuring their debts. Under this process, companies that cannot meet their obligations can renegotiate their debts and change their repayment terms in order to improve their liquidity. By restructuring, they can continue operations.\n\nFor individuals who experience financial distress, the tips to remedy the situation are similar to those listed above. Those affected may find it prudent to cut back on unnecessary or excessive spending habits such as dining out, travel, and other purchases that may be deemed a luxury. Another option may becredit counseling. With credit counseling, a counselor renegotiates a debtor's obligations, allowing him or her to avoid bankruptcy.Debt consolidationis another method for reducing monthly debt obligations by rolling high-interest debts such as credit cards into a single, lower-interest personal loan.\n\nOne factor contributing to thefinancial crisis of 2007\u20132008was the government\u2019s history of providing emergency loans to distressed financial institutions in markets believed \"too big to fail.\" This created an expectation for parts of the financial sector being protected against losses, known asmoral hazard.\n\nThe federal financial safety net is supposed to protect large financial institutions and their creditors from failure to reduce systemic risk to the financial system. However, these guarantees also encouraged imprudent risk-taking that caused instability in the very system the safety net was supposed to protect.\n\nBecause the government safety net subsidizes risk-taking, investors who feel protected by the government may be less likely to demand higher yields as compensation for assuming greater risks. Likewise, creditors may feel less urgency for monitoring firms implicitly protected. Excessive risk-taking means firms are more likely to experience distress and may require bailouts to stay solvent. Additional bailouts may erode market discipline further.\n\nResolution plans or corporate \"living wills\" may be an important method of establishing credibility against bailouts. The government safety net may then be a less attractive option in times of financial distress.",
