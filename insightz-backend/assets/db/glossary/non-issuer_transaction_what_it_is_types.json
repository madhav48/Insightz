  "definition": "Daniel Rathburn is an editor at Investopedia who works on tax, accounting, regulatory, and cryptocurrency content.\n\nA non-issuer\u00a0transaction\u00a0is a transaction involving a security that is not directly or indirectly executed for the benefit of theissuingcompany. Most deals that occur on thesecondary market, such as stock exchanges, involve non-issuer transactions; secondary offerings; or share buybacks that will involve the issuer.\n\nIsolated non-issuer transactions are exempt from the registration requirements of theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC). For instance, if Joe sells 100 shares\u00a0of XYZ stock to his brother, this transaction would be exempt from registration requirements.\n\nHowever, once Joe sells those 100 shares to his brother, he officially becomes what's known as a non-issuerbroker-dealer. Non-issuers can be described as a person or company that doesn't issue securities or have plans to do so and a broker-dealer is a person or firm that buys and sellssecuritiesfor its own account or on behalf of its customers.\n\nRegulations are much lighter on non-issuer broker-dealers, although these figures are also very limited in what they can do while legally maintaining this status.\n\nAuditorsof a non-issuer\u00a0broker-dealer must be registered with thePublic Company Accounting Oversight Board(PCAOB)\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b as of the date of the auditor\u2019s report. Auditors are encouraged to begin the registration process with the PCAOB as soon as practicable. Non-public broker-dealers are also advised to contact the Commission\u2019s Division of Trading and Markets to discuss individual circumstances if necessary.\n\nAuditors of non-issuer\u00a0broker-dealers must continue to comply with Exchange Act Rule 17a-5(f)(3), which states that the auditor \u201cshall be independent in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7210.2-01(b) and (c) of this chapter.\u201d However, auditors of non-issuer\u00a0broker-dealers are not subject to the partner rotation requirements or compensation requirements of \u00a7210.201(c).\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"17 CFR Parts 240 and 249,\" Page 95.",
