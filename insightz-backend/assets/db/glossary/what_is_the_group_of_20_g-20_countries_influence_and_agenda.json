  "term": "What Is the Group of 20 (G-20)? Countries, Influence, and Agenda",
  "definition": "The Group of 20, also called the G-20, is a\u00a0group of finance ministers andcentral bankgovernors from 19 of the world's largest economies, including those of many developing nations,\u00a0along with theEuropean Union. Formed in 1999, the G-20 promotes global economic growth, international trade, and regulation of financial markets.\n\nBecause the G-20 is a forum, not a legislative body, its agreements and decisions have no legal impact, but they do influence countries' policies and global cooperation. Together, the economies of the G-20 countries represent more than 80%\u00a0of the\u00a0gross world product\u00a0(GWP), 75% of\u00a0world trade, and 60% of the\u00a0world population.After its inaugural\u00a0leaders' summit in 2008, the leaders of the G-20 announced that the group would replace theG-8as the main economic council of nations.\n\nThe agenda and activities of the G-20 are established by its rotating Presidencies, in cooperation with the membership. Initially, the group's discussion had a focus on the sustainability ofsovereign debtand global financial stability. Those themes have continued as frequent topics at the G-20's summits, along with discussions about global\u00a0economic growth,international trade, and\u00a0the regulation of financial markets.\n\nUnder the current Indonesian Presidency, the G-20 is focused on three interconnected pillars of action: global health architecture, digital transformation, and sustainable energy transition.The 2021 summit was held in Rome on Oct. 30 and 31. Some of the topics at that summit included: supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and women-owned businesses, the role of the private sector in the fight against climate change, and sustainable development.\n\nPreviously, the 2019 G-20 Osaka summit focused on the global economy, trade and investment, innovation, the environment and energy, employment, women's empowerment, development, and wellness.In 2018, Argentina proposed a focus on the future of work, infrastructure for development, and a\u00a0sustainable food\u00a0future. That meeting also included talks on the regulation ofcryptocurrenciesand the U.S.-Chinatrade war.\n\nThe year the Group of 20 (G-20) was formed.\n\nThe G-20's ranks include all members of theGroup of Seven (G-7), a forum of the European Union and the seven countries with the world's largestdeveloped economies: France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. Formed in 1975, the G-7 meets annually on international issues, including economic and monetary matters.\n\nApart from being older than the G-20, the G-7 has sometimes been described as a more political body because all of its meetings have long included not only finance ministers but chief ministers, including presidents and prime ministers. However, the G-20, since the global financial crisis of 2008, has increasingly held summits that include political leaders as well as finance ministers and bank governors.\n\nAnd where the G-7 exclusively comprises developed countries, many of the additional 12 nations that make up the G-20 are drawn from those with developing economies. Indeed, having a forum at which developed and emerging nations could confer was part of the impetus for creating the G-20.\n\nIn 2014, the G-7 and G-20 took different approaches to Russia's membership after the country made military incursions into Ukraine and eventually annexed the Ukrainian territory of Crimea. G-7, which Russia had formally joined in 1998 to create the G-8, suspended the country's membership in the group; Russia subsequently decided to formally leave the G-8 in 2017.\n\nThough Australia, host of the 2014 G-20 summit in\u00a0Brisbane, proposed to ban\u00a0Russia\u00a0from the summit over its role, Russia has remained a member of the larger group, in part because of strong support from Brazil, India, and China, who together with Russia are collectively known as theBRICnations.\n\nThe debate over Russia's membership in the G-20 was renewed in March 2022 following its invasion of Ukraine. While attending G7 and NATO summits in Brussels on March 24, President Biden called for Russia's expulsion from the group. But Russian officials insisted Vladimir Putin would attend the G-20 summit scheduled to take place in Indonesia in November.\n\nAlong with the members of the G-7,\u00a012 other nations currently comprise the G-20: Argentina,\u00a0Australia,\u00a0Brazil,\u00a0China,\u00a0India,\u00a0Indonesia,\u00a0Mexico,\u00a0Russia,\u00a0Saudi Arabia,\u00a0South Africa,\u00a0South Korea,\u00a0and Turkey.\n\nIn addition, the G-20 invites guest countries to attend their events. Spain\u00a0is invited permanently as is the current chair of theAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN); two African countries (the chair of the\u00a0African Union\u00a0and a representative of the\u00a0New Partnership for Africa's Development) and at least one country invited by the presidency, usually from its own region.\n\nInternational organizations such as theInternational Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the United Nations, the Financial Stability Board, and theWorld Trade Organizationalso attend the summits.\n\nThe work of ensuring the continuity of the G-20 is handled by a \"Troika,\" represented by the country that holds the Presidency, its predecessor, and its successor. The current Troika countries include Italy, Indonesia, and India.\n\nThe G-20 has been criticized for lack of transparency, encouraging trade agreements that strengthen large corporations, being slow to combat climate change, and failing to address social inequality\u00a0and global threats to democracy.\n\nSince its inception, some of the G-20's operations have drawn controversy. Concerns include transparency and accountability, with critics calling attention to the absence of a formal charter for the group and the fact that some of the most important G-20 meetings are held behind closed doors.\n\nSome of the group's policy prescriptions have also been unpopular, especially with liberal groups. Protests at the group's summits have, among other criticisms, accused the G-20 of encouraging trade agreements that strengthen large corporations, of being delinquent\u00a0in combating\u00a0climate change, and in failing to address social inequality\u00a0and global threats to democracy.\n\nThe G-20's membership policies have come under fire, too. Critics say the group is overly restrictive, and its practice of adding guests, such as those from African countries, is little more than a token effort to make the G-20 reflective of the world's economic diversity. Former U.S. President\u00a0Barack Obama\u00a0noted the challenge of determining who can join such a powerful group: \"Everybody wants the smallest possible group that includes them. So, if they're the 21st largest nation in the world, they want the G-21, and think it's highly unfair if they have been cut out.\"\n\nThe Brookings Institute. \"Welcome to the New Era of G20 Global Leadership,\" Page 1.\n\nG20. \"G20 Presidency of Indonesia.\"\n\nItalian Government Presidency of the Council of Ministers. \"G20 Rome Summit - 30 October.\"\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. \"G20 Osaka Leaders' Declaration.\"\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Worship. \"Argentina Announces G20 Agenda Priorities.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"International Issues.\"\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs of Japan. \"G20 Foreign Ministers' Extraordinary Virtual Meeting.\"\n\nOxfam. \"Turn the Tide: The G20 Must Act on Rising Inequality, Starting with Fairer Global Tax Reform.\"\n\nGlobal Policy Journal. \"Spain's Relationship Status with the G20: It's Complicated.\"",
