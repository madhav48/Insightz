It can be used legally or illegally. Legal tax shelters range from investment accounts that provide favorable tax treatment to activities that lower taxable income through deductions or credits. Illegal tax shelters are used for tax evasion.\n\nThere are numerous tax shelters that the government has provided to help taxpayers lower their tax burden.Tax deductions, for one, are amounts of income that can be deducted from an individual\u2019s taxable income. The tax rate that is applied to the lower taxable income will translate into a lower tax bill for the individual. Some tax shelters that are provided in the form of tax deductions include deduction of charitable contributions,student loan interest deduction, mortgage interest deduction, deduction for certain medical expenses, etc.\n\nFor example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows charitable donations to be tax deductible for up to 50% of an individual\u2019sadjusted gross income (AGI). If a taxpayer with an annual income of $82,000 elects to donate $12,000 to aqualified charitable organization, for example, their taxable income will be reduced to $70,000. Since they fall in the 22% marginaltax bracket, they would lower their tax bill by $2,640 ($12,000 x 22%).\n\nTax shelters are legally available in the form of investment andretirement accountsthat shelter income from taxes. The tax shelter provided through these accounts serves as an incentive to save for retirement. Contributions made to a traditional (non-Roth)401(k),403(b), orindividual retirement account (IRA)will not be taxable until retirement. This way, money that would have been taxed by the IRS accrues interest and earnings in the account until the funds are withdrawn, ideally when the taxpayer is in a lower tax bracket.\n\nA taxpayer who takes advantage of the tax shelter provided through a 401(k), 403(b), or IRA reduces their taxable income by the amount of their contribution.\n\nFor individuals who expect to be in a higher income tax bracket by the time they retire, theRoth IRAandRoth 401(k)provide a way to shelter income from higher taxes. With a Roth account, the contributed income is taxed before entering the account. Then there are no taxes in retirement when the funds are withdrawn, as long as the account has been open for at least five years.\n\nWhen choosing between a Roth or traditional retirement account, consider whether you should pay taxes now or later.\n\nIt may be better to pay taxes today (with a Roth account) to make sure those investments can be withdrawn tax-free.\n\nInvestors withforeign investmentsin their portfolios can take advantage of theforeign tax creditwhich applies to taxpayers who pay tax on their foreign investment income to a foreign government. The credit can be used by individuals, estates, or trusts to reduce theirincome taxliability.\n\nTo encourage investment in companies of certain sectors (oil exploration, renewable energy, and mining, for example) which require heavycapital investmentand take several years to start making profits, the government allows the exploration costs incurred by these companies to be distributed to shareholders as tax deductions. Theexploration and development costsare taken as the shareholders\u2019 expenses; shareholders deduct the expenses from their taxable income as if they directly incurred these costs.\n\nSomemunicipal bondsare tax-exempt, meaning that any interest income that is generated is free from the obligation offederal income taxes. And in many cases, it's exempt from state and local income taxes as well. Note that interest income from municipal bonds is generally not subject to theAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT).\n\nMutual fundsthat invest in government ormunicipal bondsare also common tax shelters. Though you still pay income tax on your initial investment when those dollars are earned, the interest generated by thesedebt securitiesis exempt fromfederal income taxes, so your investment generates annual income tax-free.\n\nPhysicalreal estatein addition toreal estate investment trust (REIT)vehicles may be used as a tax shelter. Taxpayers may receive favorable treatment due todepreciationdeductions. Taxpayers may also receive benefits by performing1031 like-kind exchangesthat allow for the sale of a property and avoidance ofcapital gainsof the proceeds. Landlords and real estate investors may also be able to deduct rental losses from their rental income, thereby reducing their taxable income.\n\nIn some cases, agreements between landowners and a conservation organization can result in a tax benefit. These easements often reduce the use of land in order to protect a natural resource. When a taxpayer donates a conservation easement, they may be able to claim a tax deduction based on the value of the easement.\n\nThere are two primary tax sheltering strategies.\n\nThe first is trying tominimize tax liability. This is done most often by minimizing taxable income by offsetting taxable income against taxable losses or by simply reducing taxable income. For tax avoidance strategies, the goal is to never pay that tax and avoid taxes altogether.\n\nThe second is tax deferral. Consider popular retirement accounts such as atraditional IRA. Thegainsfor a traditional IRA are taxable when withdrawn. That is, those taxes are deferred to the future. Therefore, a taxpayer can plan for the future and not worry about immediate tax implications.\n\nThe IRS tax code changes every year. It is critical you consult your tax advisor when considering tax shelter strategies, as your assumptions from one year may no longer be valid in the next.\n\nWhile tax shelters provide a legal way to avoid taxes, they can also be used illegally, to evade taxes. Tax minimization (also referred to astax avoidance) is a perfectly legal way to minimize taxable income and lower taxes payable. Do not confuse this withtax evasion, the illegal avoidance of taxes through misrepresentation or similar means.\n\nIf an investment is made for the sole purpose of avoiding or evading taxes, you could be forced to pay additional taxes and penalties.\n\nCompanies that create offshore companies for the purpose of evading taxes will be heavily penalized by the IRS. Such activity is subject to steep fees and criminal prosecution.\n\nAtax havenis a country or jurisdiction that offers low tax rates. A tax haven may also offer taxpayers minimal or no tax reporting requirements alongside strong financial privacy laws.\n\nIndividuals and businesses use tax havens to avoid or evade taxes. Though tax shelters may accomplish some of the same outcomes as a tax haven, tax havens are often coupled with a lack of transparency and secrecy.\n\nThe best way to shelter money from taxes is to seek deductions, credits, or tax-favorable investment vehicles. These strategies may either reduce your taxable income (and resulting tax liability) or defer taxes to a future period, ideally when you're in a lower tax bracket. Most often, investors can leverage their company's 401(k) plan to generate investment earnings with tax deferred (or, in the case of a Roth account, tax-free) growth.\n\nAn LLC may be a tax shelter, depending on prevailing tax brackets. The taxable income of an LLC may be assessed at a rate as high as 21%. Should a sole proprietor earning the same revenue be taxed at their individual marginal tax rate, they may pay a substantially more in taxes.\n\nWealthy people avoid taxes in a few different ways. First, they often strive to minimize their net taxable income each year. This includes offsetting gains with losses, and this means avoiding largecapital gains taxesfor the disposal of assets. In some cases, wealthy individuals may take out loans with personal property as collateral to meet cashflow needs while not generating taxable income.\n\nA tax shelter is a strategy or investment vehicle that is designed to reduce or defer tax liabilities. Tax shelters can be used by individuals, businesses, or organizations. Legal tax shelters take advantage of deductions, credits, or other incentives provided by the tax code, whereas illegal tax shelters are used for tax evasion.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Credits and Deductions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS releases tax inflation adjustments for tax year 2025.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRC 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cForeign Tax Credit.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 535: Business Expenses,\u201d Page 37.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 550: Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital Gains and Losses),\u201d Page 12.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 550: Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital Gains and Losses),\u201d Page 5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Like-Kind Exchanges - Real Estate Tax Tips.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cConservation Easements.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Part 25.
