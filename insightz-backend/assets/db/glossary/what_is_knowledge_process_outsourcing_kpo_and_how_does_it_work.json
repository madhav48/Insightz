  "term": "What Is Knowledge Process Outsourcing (KPO) and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "Knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) is theoutsourcingof core, information-related\u00a0business activities. KPO involves contracting out work to individuals who typically have advanced degrees and expertise in a specialized area.\n\nThe information-related work can be carried out by workers in a different company or by a subsidiary of the same organization. The subsidiary may be in the same country or in anoffshorelocation to save costs or other resources.\n\nKnowledge process outsourcing is the purposeful allocation of relatively high-level tasks involving specialized knowledge or problem-solving\u00a0to an outside organization or third party that has a high level of subject matter expertise, often located in a different geographic region than the company itself.\n\nKPO is different frombusiness process outsourcing (BPO), which involves the outsourcing of labor and other operational work to athird partyto save money. Although KPO is a subset of BPO, KPO involves far more specialized, analytical, and knowledge-based work.\n\nCompanies that engage in KPO look to obtain highly educated and skilled individuals without having the cost of training and developing those workers to execute one-off or special projects that are not part of recurring activities. Through KPO, a company can quickly add experts in specific fields to boost competitiveness and increase earnings or to accomplish special tasks for which there is no need to internally hiresubject matter expertsfor permanent roles on a full-time basis.\n\nSome common example of KPO outsourcing domains include:\n\nCompanies utilize KPO\u00a0when they are looking for specialized knowledge and expertise where that knowledge base or skill cannot be found in-house. However, companies that engage in KPO offshore also typically do so in order to reduce costs by\u00a0hiring skilled workers earning lower wages in another location instead of hiring one directly as an employee. Ideally, companies look to KPO to obtain a highly skilled workforce at a lower cost.\n\nFor example, amanufacturermight use raw materials,\u00a0add value to those materials through various processes, and then sell the result as\u00a0a final product. The company might look to KPO to determine how to improve efficiency in its production process so that it can deliver maximum value for the lowest possible total cost. The result of KPO might also help the company create a competitive advantage.\n\nKPO can help companies reduce operational or production costs by creating new processes or streamlining efficiency. KPO fills the gap or need for skilled employees in a particular field. It also frees up existing staff, including management, to do other work, boosting efficiency and productivity.\n\nThe flexibility that comes with KPO allows a company to increase or reduce staff easily.\u00a0For example, if economic conditions worsen, a company can easily reduce its KPO staff to cut costs. Conversely, a company can quickly hire specialized staff to boostprofitsor revenue. KPO helps a company to be more nimble and adapt to the changes in its industry and competitive landscape.\n\nHowever, disadvantages do exist with KPO. Privacy of intellectual property and business security can be compromised if classified or proprietary information is lost, copied, or brought to a competitor. Companies have less control over the hiring process of outsourced workers.\u00a0As a result, a company might not be able to ensure the character of its outsourced employees or the quality of their work.\n\nImplementing KPO can be time- and resource-intensive to establish a successful operation. Moreover, communication can be a concern and a challenge, due to legal, language, and cultural barriers. Another disadvantage: Existing employees might feel threatened by the hiring of outsourced workers and feel their jobs are at risk.\n\nCan create new processes or streamline efficiency, reducing costs\n\nFrees up existing staff to do other work, boosting efficiency and productivity\n\nHelps a company to be more nimble and adapt to industry changes\n\nEliminates cost of training and developing individuals in specialized skills\n\nPrivacy of intellectual property and business security may be compromised\n\nEnsuring the character of outsourced employees and the quality of their work can be difficult\n\nLanguage, cultural, and legal barriers present communication challenges\n\nExisting employees may feel threatened\n\nKnowledge process outsourcing (KPO) is the practice of outsourcing processes that involve highly specialized skills, such as data analysis and market research. Industries that may use KPO include legal, life sciences, and financial services, to help boost cost savings and efficiency.\n\nBy comparison, business process outsourcing (BPO) is a broader term used to describe outsourcing of different processes, most commonly categorized into back-office or front-office activities. These may include outsourcing accounts payable or payroll services to vendors outside of a company.\n\nKPO vendors can provide a range of skills to an organization across analytical-intensive processes to help with operational efficiency and provide expertise, enabling the company to focus on revenue generation. Additionally, KPOs may offer new services, help in product development, and analyze data.\n\nA KPO may work with a company to build a mobile app, providing expertise in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design services. Through this process, it could provide software development services that help the company bring the app to life, from the early conceptual stages to the final product.\n\nAs another example, a KPO may provide the coding and game architecture for video game development through its pool of skilled professionals.\n\nFor organizations looking to outsource a knowledge function, such as research services and software development, KPOs offer a wide range of capabilities. Among the primary advantages of these services is that they allow companies to focus on their core competencies, while outsourcing functions that require a specialized set of skills and tools to utilize.",
