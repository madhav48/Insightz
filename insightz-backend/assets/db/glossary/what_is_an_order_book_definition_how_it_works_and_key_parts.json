  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nOrder books are used by almost every exchange to list the orders of stocks, bonds, currencies, and other assets.\n\nAn\u00a0order book lists the number of shares being bid on or offered at each price point ormarket depth. It also identifies the market participants behind the buy and sell orders although some choose to remain anonymous. These lists help traders and also improve market transparency because they provide valuable trading information.\n\nOrder books are used by almost every exchange to list the orders for different assets like stocks, bonds, and currencies \u2014 evencryptocurrencieslike Bitcoin. These orders can be both manual or electronic. Although they generally contain the same information, the setup may be slightly different depending on the source. Buy and sell information may appear on the top and bottom, or on the left and right side of the screen.\n\nAn order book is dynamic, meaning it's constantly updated in real-time throughout the day. Exchanges such asNasdaqrefer to it\u00a0as the \"continuous book.\" Orders that specifyexecution onlyat market open or market close are maintained separately. These are known as the \u201copening (order) book\u201d and \u201cclosing (order) book\u201d respectively.\n\nFor instance, the opening and continuous books are consolidated at the Nasdaq market open to create a single opening price. The same happens when the market closes when the closing book and continuous book are consolidated to generate a single closing price.\n\nThere are typically three parts to an order book: buyorders, sell orders, and order history.\n\nThe top of the book is where you'll find the highest bid and lowest ask prices. These point to thepredominant market and pricethat are needed to get an order executed. The book is often accompanied by acandlestick chart, which provides useful information about the current and past state of the market.\n\nThe order book helps traders make more informed trading decisions. They can see whichbrokeragesare buying or selling stock and determine whether market action is being driven byretail investorsor by institutions. The order book also shows order imbalances that may provide clues to a stock\u2019s direction in the very short term.\n\nFor instance, a massive imbalance of buy orders versus sell orders may indicate a move higher in the stock due to buying pressure. Traders can also use the order book to help pinpoint a stock\u2019s potential support and resistance levels. A cluster of large buy orders at a specific price may indicate a level of support, while an abundance of sell orders at or near one price may suggest an area of resistance.\n\nAlthough the order book is meant to provide transparency to market participants, some details aren't included in the list. Among these are \u201cdark pools.\u201d These are batches of hidden orders maintained by large players who do not want their trading intentions known to others.\n\nWithout dark pools, exchanges would see significant price devaluation. When information about a big transaction by a large institution is made public before the trade is executed, it normally leads to a drop in the price of the security. But if information about the transaction is reported after it takes place, the impact on the market may be significantly lowered.\n\nThe presence of dark pools reduces the utility of the order book to some extent since there is no way of knowing whether the orders shown on the book are representative of truesupply and demandfor the stock.\n\nThe term order book can also be used to describe a log of orders a company receives from its customer base.\n\nOrder books continue to collate an increasing amount of information for traders for a fee. Nasdaq\u2019s TotalView claims to provide more market information than any other book\u2014displaying more than 20 times theliquidityof its legacyLevel 2market depth product.\n\nWhile this extra information may not be very significant to the average investor, it may be useful today tradersand experienced market professionals who rely on the order book to make trading decisions.\n\nCoinbase. \"What is an Order Book?\"",
