  "definition": "Willie B. Thomas / Getty Images\n\nThe FINRA Series 6 license allows an individual to act as a registered representative and sell specific financial instruments.\n\nSeries 6 is a securities license entitling the holder to register as a company's representative and sell certain types ofmutual funds,variable life insurance,municipal fundsecurities,variable annuities, andunit investment trusts(UITs). Holders of the Series 6 license are not authorized to sell corporate or municipal securities, direct participation programs, and options.\n\nThe Series 6 license is used in the financial services industry. Jobs utilizing the Series 6 license include financial advisors, retirement plan specialists, investment advisors, and private bankers. TheFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA) license allows an individual to act as a registered representative and sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and unit investment trusts (UITs).\n\nA Series 6 holder cannot sell other securities, such as stocks, bonds, and options. If an individual wants to sell these types of securities, they need a different license, such as the FINRA Series 7 license.\n\nIndividuals with a Series 6 license provide investment advice and recommendations to clients, process transactions, and maintain accurate records of their activities. Series 6 licensees may work for a brokerage firm, bank, insurance company, or other financial institution.\n\nTo obtain the Series 6 license, candidates must pass the Investment Company/Variable Contracts Products Limited Representative (Series 6) exam. TheSecurities Industry Essentials(SIE) exam is a corequisite for the Series 6 exam but does not require firm sponsorship.\n\nThe Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) administers the Series 6 exam. The test covers mutual funds, variable annuities, securities, tax regulations, retirement plans, and insurance products. Candidates must be sponsored by a member of FINRA or aself-regulatory organization(SRO) to take the exam, which contains 50 scored questions.\n\nUpon receiving a passing grade, candidates must register with FINRA through their sponsoring firm to transact authorized securities. Holders of Series 6 are considered limited representatives of their sponsoring firm who can sell certain types of mutual funds, variable annuities, and variable life insurance.\n\nSeries 6 license holders are not authorized to sell stocks,exchange-traded funds(ETFs), or bonds.\n\nFINRA began offering online testing administered by Prometric, including the Series 6 exam, in 2020. Candidates or their employers must install specialized software and provide cameras.A Series 6 license expires two years after employment unless under special circumstances such as military deployment. TheSIEexam is valid for up to four years.\n\nA passing grade of 70% is achieved by correctly answering at least 35 of the 50 questions within 90 minutes. Five additional questions are unscored for a total of 55 questions. The test costs $75 and is administered via computer with no reference material allowed.As outlined by FINRA, the Series 6 exam covers four specific sections.\n\nThe Series 6 exam is oftencompared to the Series 7 exam. The Series 6 exam costs less and has a shorter test covering less material. However, a Series 6 license is all that some financial advisors, investment advisors, and retirement planners need to sell insurance, annuities, and certain types of mutual funds.\n\nSeries 6 holders cannot sell stocks,exchange-traded funds(ETFs), or bonds. Financial advisors and retirement planners who want to sell ETFs must obtain aSeries 7license, which requires taking a longer and more comprehensive exam. The Series 7 license is more expansive than the Series 6 and may open more job opportunities in the securities industry.\n\nLicensees must fulfill continuing education requirements and receive sponsorship from a FINRA-registered company to keep Series 6 licenses. FINRA\u2019s continuing education program includes a regulatory element and a firm element. FINRA Rule 1240 requires registered individuals to complete the regulatory element each year by Dec. 31. The firm element requires broker-dealers to establish and maintain a continuingeducation program.\n\nAs of 2024, the Series 6 exam costs\u00a0$75.\n\nAfter two years, an individual with a Series 6 license must complete a certain number of continuing education (CE) credits depending on the state where the individual is licensed. The CE regulatory element must be completed by Dec. 31 each year or registration is considered inactive. Individuals may not engage in, or be compensated for, activities requiring a securities registration. If a license holder's registration remains inactive for two years, it will be administratively terminated, and they must re-qualify by examination.\n\nThe FINRA Series 6 is a securities license that allows an individual to act as a registered representative and sell mutual funds, variable annuities, and unit investment trusts (UITs).
