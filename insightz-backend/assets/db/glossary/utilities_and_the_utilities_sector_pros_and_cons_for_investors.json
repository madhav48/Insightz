  "term": "Utilities and the Utilities Sector: Pros and Cons for Investors",
  "definition": "Sector investing offers targeted opportunities into the stocks of companies in specific segments of the economy. The utilities sector includes companies such as electric, gas, or water utilities or those that operate as producers or distributors of power.\n\nAs of January 2025, the sector had amarket capitalizationof over $1.83 trillion.Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service infrastructure and are heavily regulated. Those who include utilities in their portfolios hold them as long-term investments and commonly use them to generate income throughdividends.\n\nUtilities include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas or specialize in just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean andrenewable energysources like wind turbines and solar panels to produce electricity.\n\nUtilities typically offer investors stable and consistent dividends, coupled with less pricevolatilityrelative to the overall equity markets. As a result, utilities tend to perform well during recessions and economic downturns. Conversely, utility stocks tend to fall out of favor with the market during times ofeconomic growth.\n\nUtilities require a significant amount of expensiveinfrastructureand consequently carry large amounts of debt on their balance sheets. Thesedebt loadsmake utilities hypersensitive to changes in the marketinterest rate. And because utilities are capital-intensive, they require a continuous inflow of funds to finance infrastructure upgrades and new asset purchases.\n\nAs of January 2025, higher inflation raised new challenges for utilities. During the inflation of the 1970s and 80s, utilities faced large debt, soaring fuel costs, blackouts, increased regulation, andbankruptcies. Utilities that succeed through economic challenges will likely continue to rank as stable assets due to steady demand.\n\nAlthough the sector appeals to a wide range of investors, utilities companies commonly attract income-producing investments.\n\nBecause utility stocks pay reliable dividends, investors often favor them over lower-dividend paying equities. After thefinancial crisis, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, to stimulate the economy.As a result, investors flocked to utilities, assafer investmentsas utility companies are a viable defensive choice for investors during macroeconomic downturns.\n\nIf interest rates rise, investors can find higher-yielding alternatives than utilities. When a utility pays adividend yieldof 3% but increases in interest rates increase Treasurybond yieldsto 4%, the utility company would have to increase its dividend payout to match the rising yields.\n\nAside from investing in the individual stocks of utility companies, investors may also purchase regional utilities or invest inexchange-traded funds(ETFs) or sector funds containing a basket of utility stocks of companies located throughout the U.S.\n\nThe Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (FSUTX) includes the holdings of 31 utility companies as of January 2025 and $1.9 billion in assets.TheUtilities Select Sector SPDR Fund(XLU) is one of the largest utility sector funds, with $17.6 billion in net assets, and is one of the most actively traded utility ETFs, with more than 2.4 million shares traded daily. The fund typically pays a dividend yield of around 3%.\n\nThe XLU's dividend yield beats the yield for the S&P 500 equity ETF, SPDRS&P 500 Trust ETF(SPY), which as of January 2025, pays around 1.16%.\n\nUtilities are stable investments that commonly provide a regular dividend to shareholders, making them a popular long-termbuy-and-holdoption. Dividend yields on utility stocks trend higher than those paid by other equities.\n\nDuring times of economic downturns with low interest rates, utilities become attractive. They exhibit lower volatility and provide a desirable source of predictable investment returns from the dividends they pay on their shares.Profit margins for utilitiescan vary from company to company, depending on their location and the regulations they face.\n\nUtilities, however, face intense regulatory oversight and require expensive infrastructure that needs routine updating and maintenance. To meet these infrastructure needs, utility companies often float debt products that, in turn, increase their debt loads. This debt also makes these services particularly sensitive to interest rate risk. Should rates rise, the company must offer higher yields to attract bond investors.\n\nStable, long-term investments and regular dividends\n\nSafe investments during times of economic downturns\n\nVarious investment options including bonds, ETFs, and individual company stocks\n\nExpensive infrastructure that requires continual upgrades and maintenance\n\nBecome less attractive when interest rates are high and bond yields are high\n\nThe utilities sector consists of companies that provide electricity, natural gas, water, sewage, and other services to homes and businesses.\u00a0Public utilities are privately owned companies that are regulated by public utility commissions that operate at a variety of jurisdictional levels, usually at the state level.\n\nThese commissions are overseen by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. NARUC members are responsible for assuring reliable utility service at fair and reasonable rates.In 2022,utility companies in the United Stateswith a strong investor interest included:\n\nIn 2020, former President Joe Biden called for the country to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050, committing nearly $2 trillion in investment to achieve this goal.The energy and utility industry has an opportunity to advance its grid modernization and clean energy efforts by tapping into funds allocated in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which includes $65 billion earmarked for upgrading the national power infrastructure.\n\nA 2022 industry outlook report by Deloitte identified five trends for the utilities industry which include enhanced competition, expansions in infrastructure, greater electrification of transportation, an emphasis on disaster readiness, and traditional energy players entering the renewable energy field.\n\nAccording to Fidelity utility sectorportfolio managerDouglas Simmons, the fundamentals of utilities in 2022 look very robust overall, driven by the ongoing shift toward renewable energy sources and away from fossil fuels.\n\nUtilities remain wary of regulations that may force the closure of power plants, though the sector largely supported thetax creditsproposed in a bill called Build Back Better, which aimed to provide more than $300 billion in directsubsidiesfor wind, solar, transmission, storage, carbon capture, and nuclear projects. Build Back Better failed to pass the Senate and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA appropriates $369 billion for climate and clean energy initiatives, including tax incentives that should reduce the costs of the renewable energy transition for utilities companies. However, the second Trump administration froze IRA funding, leaving many of the associated projects in financial limbo.\n\nRenewable energy resources are expected to grow from 12% of the US energy mix as of 2021 to 39% by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley.\n\nPublic utilities are regulated by the government or state under the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and commonly supply electricity, gas, or water to a region or area.\n\nGlobally, the largest utility is NextEra Energy, a provider of electricity-related services and a market capitalization of $150 as of 2025. Its principal subsidiary, FPL, is a rate-regulated utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy.\n\nThe utilities sector is an industrial category of stocks, consisting of companies that provide basic everyday amenities, including natural gas, electricity, water, and power. Typically, investors buy utilities stocks as long-term holdings. These equities typically feature stable prices and good dividend income. The movement toward \"clean\" energy, along with competition-enhancing legislation and a presidential administration committed to renewable energy resources, has some financial analysts forecasting strong growth for the utilities sector in the 2020s.\n\nCorrection\u2014March 20, 2024:This article has been corrected to state that investing in utilities becomes less attractive when interest rates and bond yields are high.\n\nDeloitte. \"2025 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"The Federal Reserve's Policy Actions During the Financial Crisis and Lesson for the Future.\"\n\nFidelity. \"Detailed Quote: XLU.\"\n\nNational Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. \"About NARUC.\"\n\nBiden-Harris Campaign. \"The Biden Plan For a Clean Energy Revolution and Environmental Justice.\"\n\nPWC. \"Infrastructure Bill Impacts on Energy & Utilities.\"\n\nDeloitte. \"2021 Power and Utilities Industry Outlook: Exploring Energy Industry Trends.\"\n\nFidelity. \"A Power Shift for Utilities Stocks.\"\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Trump Freezes IRA Funding.\"\n\nClimate Wire. \"Utilities Vow to Work With Biden on 'Build Back Better'.\"\n\nThe White House. \"FACT SHEET: How the Inflation Reduction Act Builds a Better Future for Young Americans.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"Coal to Exit From U.S. Power System by 2033, Morgan Stanley Says.\"",
