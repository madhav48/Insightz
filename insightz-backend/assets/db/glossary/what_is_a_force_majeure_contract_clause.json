  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nForce majeure is a clause included in contracts to removeliabilityfor unforeseeable and unavoidable catastrophes interrupting the expected timeline and preventing participants from fulfillingobligations. These clauses generally cover natural disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, and earthquakes, and human actions, such as armed conflict and human-made diseases.\n\nFor events to constitute the use of force majeure, they must be unforeseeable, external to contract parties, and unavoidable. Force majeure means \u201cgreater force\u201d and is related to anact of God, an event for which no party can be held accountable. These concepts are defined and applied differently depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nSuppose an avalanche destroys a supplier\u2019s factory in the French Alps, causing long shipment delays and leading the client to sue for damages. The supplier might employ a force majeure defense, arguing that the avalanche was an unforeseeable, external, and unavoidable event\u2014the three tests applied by French law.Unless the contract specifically named an avalanche as removing the supplier\u2019s liability, the court may decide that the supplier owes damages.\n\nThe concept of force majeure originated in French civil law and is an accepted standard in many jurisdictions that derive their legal systems from the Napoleonic Code. Incommon lawsystems, such as those of the United States and the United Kingdom, force majeure clauses are acceptable but must be more explicit about the events that would trigger the clause.\n\nForce majeure conflicts with the concept of \u201cpacta sunt servanda\u201d (Latin for \u201cagreements must be kept\u201d), a key concept in civil and international law with analogs in common law.It is not supposed to be easy to escape contractual liability, and proving that events were unforeseeable, for example, is difficult. Human threats like cyber, nuclear, and biological warfare capabilities ornatural disastershave raised questions about what is and is not foreseeable in a legal sense.\n\nIf a natural or other disaster repeats or reoccurs, it may not be considered unforeseeable.\n\nTheInternational Chamber of Commercehas attempted to clarify the meaning of force majeure by applying a standard of \u201cimpracticability,\u201d meaning that it would be unreasonably burdensome and expensive, if not impossible, to carry out the terms of the contract.It can be difficult to prove that an event is unforeseeable and serious enough to void a contract. In any jurisdiction, contracts containing specific definitions that constitute force majeure\u2014ideally ones that respond to local threats\u2014hold up better under scrutiny.\n\nEvents that could trigger a force majeure clause include war, terrorist attacks, a pandemic, or natural disasters that fall under the \u201cact of God\u201d category, such as a flood, earthquake, or hurricane.\n\nThe 2020 pandemic opened new litigations regarding force majeure clauses. In Virginia, Regal Cinemas theaters ceased operations because of the pandemic.\u00a0The United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia ruled that the force majeure clause in the lease executed between the parties only applied if\u00a0\u201cthe Complex or other improvements on the Property, or any part thereof, aredamaged or destroyedby fire, flood, natural causes, or other casualties[.]\u201d\u00a0\u00a0The COVID-19 pandemic did not excuse Regal Cinemas from its performance under its contract. A ruling in favor of the University of Vermont also found that because its \u201cclosure\u201d was due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and not another catastrophe, the university did not have to issue refunds for housing or meal plans.\n\nForce majeure clauses enable parties to better manage risk and protect themselves if something unthinkable happens. To implement the clause and abandon provisions of a contract or actions under the contract, an event must be unforeseeable, external to the contract parties, and serious enough to render it impossible for the party to perform contractual obligations.\n\nLatham & Watkins. \u201cImpact of COVID-19 on French Law Governed Contracts: Update,\u201d Page 1.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \u201cForce Majeure.\u201d\n\nAmerican Journal of International Law, via JSTOR. \u201cThe PrinciplePacta Sunt Servandaand the Nature of Obligation Under International Law.\u201d\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \u201cICC Force Majeure and Hardship Clauses: March 2020,\u201d Page 1.\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Force Majeure Clauses in the Aftermath of the Covid-19 Pandemic and the Implications for Government Entities.\"",
