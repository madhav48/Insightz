The form must be filed by the 15th day of the 3rd month after the corporation's tax year.\n\nIf a corporation is elected to be an S corporation and the IRS accepts the election, it must file Form 1120-S.\n\nAn S corporation is a business entity permitted under the U.S.tax code. It is meant for smaller companies with fewer than 100 shareholders. S corporations are considered pass-through entities as they don't paycorporate taxes. Instead, they pass the tax liabilities to their individual shareholders.\n\nThe IRS uses the ownership percentage detailed in Form 1120-S to allocate how much profit and loss is assigned to an individual shareholder.\n\nA shareholder's profit and loss are relatively easy to calculate if they don't see a change in the percentage of the shares they hold during the year. But if the shareholder purchases, sells, or transfers any (additional)sharesor holdings during the course of the year, then their profit and loss must beproratedon a per-share basis.\n\nThe business structure of an S corporation allows it to pass corporate income, losses, deductions, and credits through to shareholders for federal tax purposes.It avoids double taxation as individual shareholders are taxed rather than the corporation.\n\nS corporations use Form 1120-S to report income, gains, losses,credits, and deductions, along with other information to the IRS each year.\n\nThe form includes pertinent business details, including:\n\nThe remainder of the form includes other key information, which is noted in the table below.\n\nThere are also a number of different schedules that are part of Form 1120-S. These include:\n\nForm 1120-S must be accompanied bySchedule K-1. This schedule must be prepared for every shareholder.Schedule K-1 identifies each individual shareholder of the S corporation and reports the portion of income, profits, losses, credits, and deductions allotted to each shareholder. The information from Schedule K-1 is also included on each shareholder's individual tax return.\n\nForm 1120-S can be filed electronically each year. Small business owners may complete these forms on their own using specialtax software. The majority of these programs do come at a cost but may be inexpensive compared to the use of a professional.\n\nSome S corporations, especially those with more complicated tax situations, may choose to have their annual tax returns completed by a professional, such as a tax preparer or anaccountant. Having a tax professional complete and submit these forms reduces the likelihood of error.\n\nAlthough the IRS continues to accept paper returns by mail, it strongly recommends filing tax returns electronically. Submitting paper returns by mail can result in delays.\n\nAll pages of Form 1120-S can be downloaded from theIRS website.\n\nForm 1120-S is the tax return for S corporations.
