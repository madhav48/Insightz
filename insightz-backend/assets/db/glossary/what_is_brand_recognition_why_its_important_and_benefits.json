  "definition": "Getty Images / volkankovancisoy\n\nBrand recognition is a concept used in advertising andmarketingto describe consumers' ability to recognize abrandthrough visual or auditory cues such aslogos, packaging, colors, slogans, or jingles. Companies often conductmarket researchto assess the effectiveness of their brand recognition strategies. Strong brand recognition can result in higher sales and profit margins, even if competing brands are of equal quality.\n\nA brand is a name, logo, word, mark, tagline, or any other identifying characteristic that distinguishes a company's products or services from others on the market. A brand is among the most importantassetsthat a company has because it represents the company and helps keep the company in consumers' minds. The responsibility for overseeing a brand and growing its value over time is often referred to asbrand management.\n\nBrands are considered a form ofintellectual propertyand treated for accounting purposes asintangible assetsthat can be assigned a dollar value. They are normally protected usingtrademarks.\n\nCompanies invest a lot of time and money to build brand recognition so that consumers will recall\u2014and ideally choose\u2014their brand over its competitors. A company's marketing department will often use multiple cues\u2014both audio and visual\u2014to help set their brand apart in the marketplace. Logos like the Nike (NKE) swoosh and the Golden Arches from McDonald's (MCD), and taglines like \"They're magically delicious\" for Lucky Charms cereal and \"I'm a big kid now\" for Huggies Pull-Ups diapers help further brand recognition.\n\nA study of 597 corporate logos, published in theHarvard Business Review, found that descriptive logos that \"clearly communicate the type of product or service a brand is marketing\" were generally more effective in promoting brand recognition than nondescriptive ones, which \"contain design elements that are not indicative of the type of product or service these brands are selling.\" As an example of a descriptive logo, the authors cited the Burger King logo, which includes the word \"burger\" and the top and bottom halves of a hamburger bun. By contrast, the Golden Arches logo long used by McDonald's is a nondescriptive logo (although a highly successful one in terms of worldwide recognition).\n\nTo measure brand recognition and the effectiveness of their promotional andmarketing campaigns, many companies conduct market research using focus groups, online surveys, and other techniques.\n\nBrand recognition is also referred to as aided brand awareness, with cues such as a logo or distinctive color aiding consumers in remembering a brand name.\n\nWhether they'resmall businessesor hugecorporations, or somewhere in between, companies can do many different things to create and maintain brand recognition. If they're effective, the brand can make itselftop of mindwith consumers\u2014an opportune place to be when those consumers are ready to buy. Here are a few ways they can do this:\n\nBrand recognition is different frombrand awareness, another common term in the worlds of advertising and marketing. While brand recognition refers to the visual and audio cues people use to identify a brand, brand awareness is simply the extent to which the public knows that a company and its products or services exist.\n\nAs such, brand awareness can be considered a preliminary step on the path to brand recognition. For instance, if people didn't know anything about the Apple (AAPL) brand, they probably wouldn't recognize and associate the famous Apple logo with its products.\n\nOne recent study put Apple at the top of the list, valuing its brand at over $516 billion. Others in the top five included Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Samsung.\n\nBrand equityrefers to the premium a company can charge for its products and services over its competitors' offerings, even though there may be no difference in quality.\n\nThe three C's of branding are guidelines for creating and maintaining a successful brand. They areclarity(making it clear what the brand has to offer),consistency(being consistent with your visuals, messages, tone, etc.), andconstancy(frequently reminding potential customers that you're around).\n\nTo trademark a brand, you need to file an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, which explains the step-by-step process on its website.\n\nBranding is both an art and a science. Companies that do it successfully, as evidenced by their brand recognition, can enjoy greater sales and profits. But maintaining high brand recognition also requires consistent messaging and constant efforts to keep the brand in front of consumers.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"A Study of 597 Logos Shows Which Kind Is Most Effective.\"\n\nStatista. \"Most Valuable Brands Worldwide in 2024.\"\n\nUnited States Patent and Trademark Office. \"Trademark Process.\"",
