  "term": "Enterprise Value (EV) Formula and What It Means",
  "definition": "Enterprise value (EV) measures a company\u2019s total value. Its calculation includes not only the market capitalization of a company but also short-term and long-term debt, as well as any cash or cash equivalents on the company\u2019s balance sheet. It is often used as a more comprehensive alternative tomarket capitalizationwhen valuing a company.\n\nMichela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nEnterprise value (EV) differs significantly from simple market capitalization in several ways, and many consider it to be a more accurate representation of a firm\u2019s value. EV tells investors or interested parties a company\u2019s value and how much another company would need if it wanted to purchase that company.\n\nA company\u2019s EV can be negative if the total value of its cash and cash equivalents surpasses that of the combined total of its market cap and debts. This is a sign that a company is not using its assets very well\u2014it has too much cash sitting around not being used. Extra cash can be used for many things, such as distributions, buybacks, expansion, research and development, maintenance, employee pay raises, bonuses, or paying off debts.\n\nEnterprise value uses figures from a company\u2019s financial statements and current market prices. The components that make up EV are:\n\nPreferred shares and minority interest can be added to the market cap if these values are present.\n\nEnterprise value is the sum of a company's market capitalization and any debts, minus cash or cash equivalents on hand.\n\nEV=MC+TotalDebt\u2212Cwhere:MC=Market\u00a0capitalization;\u00a0equal\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0current\u00a0stockprice\u00a0multiplied\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0outstanding\u00a0stock\u00a0sharesTotaldebt=Equal\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0sum\u00a0of\u00a0short-term\u00a0andlong-term\u00a0debtC=Cash\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0equivalents;\u00a0the\u00a0liquid\u00a0assets\u00a0ofa\u00a0company,\u00a0but\u00a0may\u00a0not\u00a0include\u00a0marketable\u00a0securities\\begin{aligned} &EV=MC+Total~Debt-C\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &MC=\\text{\\small Market capitalization; equal to the current stock}\\\\ &\\text{\\small price multiplied by the number of outstanding stock shares}\\\\ &Total~debt =\\text{\\small Equal to the sum of short-term and}\\\\ &\\text{\\small long-term debt}\\\\ &C=\\text{\\small Cash and cash equivalents; the liquid assets of}\\\\ &\\text{\\small a company, but may not include marketable securities}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEV=MC+TotalDebt\u2212Cwhere:MC=Market\u00a0capitalization;\u00a0equal\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0current\u00a0stockprice\u00a0multiplied\u00a0by\u00a0the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0outstanding\u00a0stock\u00a0sharesTotaldebt=Equal\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0sum\u00a0of\u00a0short-term\u00a0andlong-term\u00a0debtC=Cash\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0equivalents;\u00a0the\u00a0liquid\u00a0assets\u00a0ofa\u00a0company,\u00a0but\u00a0may\u00a0not\u00a0include\u00a0marketable\u00a0securities\u200b\n\nTo calculate market capitalization\u2014if not readily available online\u2014you would multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt on the company\u2019s balance sheet, including both short-term and long-term debt. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result.\n\nEnterprise value is used as the basis for many financial ratios that measure the performance of a company. For example, theenterprise multiplecontains enterprise value. It\u00a0relates the total value\u00a0of a company from all sources to the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).\n\nEBITDAmeasures a company\u2019s ability to generate revenue\u00a0and is used as an alternative to simple earnings or\u00a0net income\u00a0in some circumstances. It is usually positive even when earnings per share (EPS) is not.\n\nEBITDA, however, can be misleading because it strips out the cost of capital investments like property, plant, and equipment. Another figure, EBIT, can be used as a similar financial metric without the drawback of removing depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant, and equipment (PP&E).\n\nEBITDA= Net Income + Interest Expense + Taxes +\u00a0Depreciation + Amortization\n\nThe enterprise multiple (EV/EBITDA) metric is used as a\u00a0valuation\u00a0tool to compare the value of a company and its debt to the company\u2019s cash earnings, less its non-cash expenses. As a result, it\u2019s\u00a0ideal for analysts and\u00a0investors looking to compare companies within the same industry.\n\nThe enterprise multiple is useful when:\n\nHowever, the enterprise multiple also has a few drawbacks. Ifworking capitalis growing, EBITDA will overstate cash flows from operations (CFO or OCF). Further, this measure\u00a0ignores how different revenue recognition policies can affect a company\u2019s OCF.\n\nBecause free cash flow to the firm\u00a0captures the number ofcapital expenditures (CapEx), it is more strongly\u00a0linked with valuation theory than EBITDA. EBITDA will be a generally adequate measure if\u00a0capital expenses equal depreciation expenses.\n\nAnother commonly used multiple for determining the relative value of firms\u00a0is the enterprise value-to-sales ratio, orEV/sales.\u00a0EV/sales is regarded as a more accurate measure than the price/sales ratio since it considers the\u00a0value and amount of debt that a company must repay at some point.\n\nA company with a lower EV/sales multiple is often seen as more undervalued and therefore more attractive.\u00a0The EV/sales ratio\u00a0can be negative when the cash held by a company is more than the market capitalization and debt value. A negative EV/sales implies that a company can pay off all of its debts.\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t market capitalization properly represent a firm\u2019s value? It leaves a lot of essential factors out, such as a company\u2019s debt and cash reserves. Enterprise value is a modification of market cap, as it incorporates debt and cash for determining a company\u2019s value.\n\nMarket capitalization is not intended to represent a company\u2019s book value. Instead, it represents a company\u2019s value as determined by market participants.\n\nImagine two identical widget manufacturers, Company A and Company B, have the same stock price of $4.32 per share. Each has 1 million outstanding shares with a market cap of $4.32 million.\n\nNow, imagine Company A has $500,000 in cash and cash equivalents and $250,000 in total debt. Its EV (total worth) is:\n\nCompany B, on the other hand, has $1 million in cash and $250,000 in debt. Its EV is:\n\nThe companies looked identical when using just their market capitalization. However, once the EV takes into account both debt and cash, the value of Company A is significantly higher.\n\nTheprice-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio)is a ratio for valuing a company that measures its current share price relative to itsearnings per share (EPS).\u00a0The price-to-earnings ratio is sometimes known as the\u00a0price multiple\u00a0or the earnings\u00a0multiple.\n\nThe P/E ratio doesn\u2019t consider the amount of debt that a company has on its balance sheet. EV includes debt when valuing a company and is often used in tandem with the P/E ratio to achieve a comprehensive valuation.\n\nEV includes total debt, so it\u2019s essential to consider how management utilizes that debt when valuing a company. For example, capital-intensive industries such as the oil and gas industry typically carry significant amounts of debt, which is used to foster growth in ways like purchasing a plant and equipment.\n\nIn a less capital-intensive industry, however, high levels of debt could indicate that a company is unable to generate enough revenue to cover the costs of basic operations. As a result, the EV can be skewed when comparing companies across industries.\n\nIf the company being looked at is undergoing a merger or acquisition, the acquiring company will need to account for the amount of debt it is taking on in the merger. Investors can use this information to evaluate what the merged companies will look like in the future.\n\nAs with any financial metric, it\u2019s best to compare companies within the same industry to better understand how the company is valued relative to its peers.\n\nThe formula for EV is the sum of the market value of equity (market capitalization) and the market value of a company\u2019s debt, less any cash. A company\u2019s market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the share price by the number of outstanding shares.\n\nThenet debtis the market value of debt minus cash. A company acquiring another company keeps the cash of the target firm, which is why cash needs to be deducted from the firm\u2019s price as represented by the market cap.\n\nLet\u2019s calculate the enterprise value for Macy\u2019s (M), using data from their Form 10-K.\n\nFor its 2023 fiscal year, Macy\u2019s recorded the following:\n\nWe can calculate Macy\u2019s market cap at the time from the information above. Macy\u2019s had 274.3 million outstanding shares valued at $18.64 per share at the end of its 2023 fiscal year (Feb. 3, 2024).\n\nEnterprise value is considered comprehensive when valuing a company because anyone purchasing Macy\u2019s outstanding shares for its then market capitalization of $5.13 billion would also have to settle the $2.998 billion in outstanding debts that Macy's had at that time.\n\nIn total, theacquiring companywould have to spend more than $8 billion to purchase Macy\u2019s. However, since Macy\u2019s has $1.03 billion in cash, this amount could be added to repay the debt. This lowers the total needed to purchase Macy's at the end of their fiscal year 2023 to just over $7 billion.\n\nEnterprise value shows a company\u2019s total value, including debts and cash, and is generally used inmergers and acquisitionsto evaluate a prospect. You might also seeembedded valueused to value life insurance companies, primarily in Europe.\n\nTo calculate enterprise value, calculate market capitalization by multiplying the number of outstanding shares by the current stock price. Next, total all debt (short- and long-term) on the company\u2019s balance sheet. Finally, add the market capitalization to the total debt and subtract any cash and cash equivalents from the result.\n\nEnterprise value is the total value of a company, while market value is the value of its shares on the stock market. Market capitalization is the total value of all shares on the stock market and does not take into account the value of a company's cash or debts.\n\nEnterprise value estimates a company\u2019s total value, including debt and cash. It is generally used by companies when considering a merger or acquisition. Investors can also use EV to estimate a company\u2019s size and worth to help them evaluate their stock choices. EV is best used with other metrics for valuing a stock. Some popular ratios are EV/sales and EV/EBITDA.\n\nMacy\u2019s. \u201cForm 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended Feb. 3, 2024: Macy\u2019s Inc.\u201d\n\nYahoo! Finance. \u201cMacy\u2019s, Inc.
