  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nFinancial risk manager (FRM) is a professional designation issued by theGlobal Association of Risk Professionals (GARP).\n\nThe GARP FRM accreditation is globally recognized\u00a0as the premier certification\u00a0for financial risk professionals dealing in financial markets. To earn the FRM certification, candidates must pass two rigorous exams and also work two years in the field of risk management.\n\nFRMs possess specialized knowledge in assessing risk and typically work for major banks,insurance companies, accounting firms, regulatory agencies, and asset management firms.\n\nAn FRM identifies threats to assets, earning capacity, or the success of an organization. FRMs may work in financial services, banking, loan origination, trading, or marketing. Many specialize in areas like credit or market risk.\n\nFRMs determine risk by analyzing financial markets and the global environment to predict changes or trends. It is also the FRM's role to develop strategies to counteract the effects of potential risks.\n\nFinancial risk managers (FRMs) are required to be accredited by the Global Association of Risk Professionals (GARP).\n\nThe FRM exam covers the application of risk management tools and techniques to the investment management process.\n\nTo receive the FRM designation, candidates must successfully complete a comprehensive, two-part exam\u00a0and complete two years of work in financialrisk management.\n\nProfessionals who hold the FRM designation can participate in optional continued professional development. The FRM program follows the major strategic disciplines of risk management:market risk, credit risk, operational risk, and investment management. The exam is recognized in over 90 countries and is designed to measure a financial risk manager's ability to manage risk in a global environment.\n\nThe questions are practical and related to real-world work experiences. Candidates are expected to understand risk management concepts and approaches as they would apply to a risk manager's day-to-day activities.\n\nPart 1 of the FRM exam is 100 questions that focus on the following four topics (weighted as noted):\n\nPart 2 of the exam consists of 80 questions from the following topics (weighted as follows):\n\nThe median annual salary of financial managers and FRMs in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nIn 2023, the median pay for financial managers including FRMs was $156,100 per year, according to the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nEmployment of FRMs is expected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations at 16% from 2022 to 2032. The BLS states that \"several specialties within financial management, particularly cash management and risk management, are expected to be in high demand over the decade.\"\n\nNaturally, the vast majority of FRMs are employed in the financial services industry. But the demand for good risk management teams is high in all areas of the economy, from healthcare and engineering to technology and natural resources.\n\nAccording to GARP, these are the top 10 companies employing the most FRMs:\n\nThechartered financial analyst (CFA)designation is one of the most recognized financial designations in the world. FRM is considered the \"gold standard\" of financial risk managers, and the CFA has a similarly stellar reputation among financial analysts.\n\nSince both the CFA and FRM seek to certify professionals in the financial industry, they're often compared with each other.\n\nThe basic difference between the two is this: FRM is a more specialized designation than the CFA. The CFA covers a wide range of topics related primarily to investment management, including financial analysis, corporate finance, equities, bonds, derivatives, and portfolio management.\n\nThe FRM, on the other hand, focuses primarily on managing exposure to a variety of risks, including operational risk, credit risk, market risk, and liquidity risk.\n\nThe FRM and CFA also have different requirements.\n\nTo earn your FRM certification, you must:\n\nTo become a CFA charterholder, you must:\n\nThere are several advantages to earning the FRM certification.\n\nFirst, there is the reputation that comes with the program. It is widely regarded as the risk management industry's leading designation. Thus, it is a strong indication of ability and experience within the field. In other words, the FRM carries significant weight with employers and colleagues.\n\nGiven how rapidly financial markets are changing, the demand for risk management experts will likely only grow over time.\n\nThe second benefit is the obvious educational one. As mentioned earlier, the FRM certification provides professionals with a thorough understanding of risk management. In practical terms, that means knowing how to anticipate, respond, and adapt to critical risks.\n\nThat largely depends on your career path. Generally speaking, FRMs are meant for managerial roles that focus specifically on risk (i.e., credit risk manager, regulatory risk manager, operational risk manager, and more). By contrast, CFA charterholders are primarily investment management professionals (i.e., investment analyst, portfolio manager, financial adviser, etc.).\n\nFRM exams are tough, but not as difficult as the CFA exams.\n\nThe pass rates for FRM Part 1 fall in the range of 40% to 50%; in 2023, the pass rate was 45%. For Part 2, they range between 50% and 60%, with a rate of 53% in 2023.\n\nFor the CFA exams,historical pass ratesfor Level 1 and Level 2 are generally in the range of 35% to 50%. Level 3 pass rates are usually in the ballpark of 50%.It's this combination of lower pass rates and the additional exam that makes the CFA tougher than the FRM.\n\nThe FRM charges a one-time enrollment fee of $400 to first-time FRM candidates.\n\nFrom there, standard registration is $800 for Part 1 and another $800 for Part 2. Candidates who register early, however, are able to get a discounted rate of $600 for Part 1 and $600 for Part 2.\n\nFRM is the leading professional certification for risk managers and widely recognized as the global standard for financial risk. The current demand for expert financial risk managers is high and should only continue to grow over at least the next decade.\n\nWhile the CFA is generally regarded as more prestigious and tougher to attain, FRM's big advantage lies in its highly specialized focus on risk. For professionals looking to differentiate themselves, boost job prospects, and command better pay specifically within the risk management field, the FRM is second to none.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Financial Managers: Occupational Outlook Handbook.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Occupational Outlook Handbook: Job Outlook.\"\n\nGARP. \"Financial Risk Manager Certification.\"\n\nAnalyst Prep. \"GARP FRM Pass Rates: What You Need to Know.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"CFA Exam Results and Pass Rates.\"",
