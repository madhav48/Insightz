  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nGross net written premium income (GNWPI)\u00a0is\u00a0the dollar amount of an insurance company\u2019spremiumsthat are used to determine what portion of premiums\u00a0is owed to a reinsurer. Gross net written premium income is the base to which the\u00a0reinsurance premium rate is applied, taking\u00a0into account cancellations, refunds, and premiums paid forreinsurance coverage.\n\nWhen an insurance company enters into a reinsurance agreement, it reduces its overall risk exposure by ceding some risks to a reinsurer. In exchange for taking on these risks, the reinsurer is entitled to a portion of the insurer\u2019s premiums.\n\nIn a non-proportional reinsurance agreement, the amount of premiums that the reinsurer is entitled to be determined by a fixed rate. This rate is multiplied by a base premium, which represents the dollar amount of an insurer\u2019s premiums to which the reinsurer is entitled.\n\nThe way that the subject premium is calculated is defined in the reinsurance contract. The parties agree to the reinsurance rate premium percentage that will be applied to the base premium, and whether the base premium\u2014also called the subject premium or underlying premium\u2014will be calculated usingearnedorwritten premiums.\n\nIf earned premiums are chosen,\u00a0the calculation uses gross net earned premium income (GNEPI) as the base. This is the most common rating base for an excess of loss reinsurance. If the agreement uses written premiums, then GNWPI is used.\n\nGross net written premium income is calculated by taking the ceding insurer\u2019s premium income, rather than premium receipts. The premiums are \u201cnet,\u201d\u00a0meaning that any cancelations, refunds, and premiums paid for reinsurance are deducted, and \u201cgross\u201d because expenses are not deducted. If the amount of risk taken on by the reinsurer increases over time,\u00a0the written premium income will be higher than earned premium income.\n\nGross net written premium income is a good measure of how well an insurer is doing, but\u00a0it doesn\u2019t consider earnings on investments such asequitiesorbonds. It also doesn\u2019t take into account any assets that the insurer has.\u00a0That's why many firms\u00a0are more interested in broking gross income, which does include those figures. So, while GNWPI\u00a0is a good indicator, you cannot rely on it solely\u00a0to\u00a0ascertain an\u00a0insurer\u2019s financial health.",
