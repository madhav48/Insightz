  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA tax shield is a reduction intaxable incomefor an individual or corporation achieved through claiming allowable deductions such as mortgage interest, medical expenses, charitable donations,amortization, and depreciation. These deductions reduce a taxpayer's taxable income for a given year or defer income taxes into future years. Tax shields ultimatelyreduce the amount of taxes owedby an individual or business.\n\nA tax shield refers to the ability of specificdeductionsto shield portions of a taxpayer's income from taxation. Tax shields vary from country to country, and their benefits depend on the taxpayer's overall tax rate and cash flows for the giventax year.\n\nFor example, because interest payments on certain debts are a tax-deductible expense, taking on qualifying debts can act as tax shields. Tax-efficient investment\u00a0strategies are cornerstones of investing for highnet-worthindividuals and corporations, whose annual tax bills can be very high.\n\nTo calculate the tax shield, use the following formula:\n\nTax Shield = Value of Tax-Deductible Expense\u00a0x Tax Rate\n\nSo, for instance, if you have $1,000 in mortgage interest and your tax rate is 24%, your tax shield will be $240. You can deduct up to $750,000 of homemortgage interestin 2024.In 2025, this number rises to $1 million.\n\nThe ability to use ahome mortgageas a tax shield is a major benefit for many middle-class people whose homes are major components of their net worth. It also provides incentives to those interested in purchasing a home\u00a0by providing a specific tax benefit to the borrower.\n\nSimilarly,student loan interestserves as a tax shield. The interest paid on student loans is tax-deductible, meaning it can reduce a taxpayer\u2019s taxable income, ultimately lowering their tax burden.\n\nTaxpayers who have paid more in medical expenses than covered by the standard deduction can choose toitemizein order to gain a larger tax shield. An individual may deduct any amount attributed to medical or dental expenses that exceeds 7.5%\u00a0ofadjusted gross incomeby filingSchedule A.\n\nSimilar to the tax shield offered in compensation for medical expenses, charitable giving can also lower ataxpayer\u2019s obligations. In order to qualify, the taxpayer must use itemized deductions on their tax return. The deductible amount may be as high as 60%\u00a0of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income, depending on the specific circumstances. Fordonationsto qualify, they must be given to an approved organization.\n\nThe depreciation deduction allows taxpayers to recover certain losses associated with thedepreciationof qualifying property. The deduction can apply to tangible property, such as vehicles and buildings, as well as to intangible assets, such as computer software and patents.\n\nIn order to qualify, the depreciation must be associated with an asset used in a business or income-generating activity, and have an expected lifespan of more than one year. Other conditions may affect the ability for depreciation to be deductible, including, but not limited to, the duration of ownership of the asset and whether the asset was used to build capital improvements.\n\nThe formula for tax shield is,Tax Shield = Value of Tax-Deductible Expense\u00a0x Tax Rate.\n\nWhile tax shields result in tax savings, the two concepts are not exactly the same. Tax shields reduce taxable income, which leads to a lower overall tax liability, effectively saving the taxpayer money. The lower the taxable income, the lower the tax owed, which is how tax shields translate into tax savings.\n\nA common example of a tax shield is mortgage interest. A person buys a house with a mortgage and pays interest on that mortgage. That interest is tax deductible, which is offset against the person's taxable income. This then reduces their overall tax burden.\n\nTax shields allow taxpayers to reduce the amount of taxes owed by lowering their taxable income. By taking advantage of deductions like mortgage interest, medical expenses, charitable donations, and depreciation, taxpayers can significantly reduce their tax bills. Whenfiling taxes, ensure you're claiming these deductions to save money during tax season.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction,\" Page 9.\n\nTax Foundation. \"The Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 456, Student Loan Interest Deduction.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 502, Medical and Dental Expenses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 526, Charitable Contributions,\" Pages 2-3, 14-15.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 946, How To Depreciate Property,\" Page 3.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 946, How To Depreciate Property,\" Pages 4-5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 505, Interest Expense.\"",
