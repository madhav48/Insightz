  "term": "Operating Expense Ratio (OER): Definition, Formula, and Example",
  "definition": "In real estate, the operating expense ratio (OER) is a measurement of the cost to operate a piece of property, compared to the income brought in by the property. It is calculated by dividing a property's operating expense (minus depreciation) by its gross operating income.\n\nOER is used for comparing the expenses of similar properties. An investor should look forred flags, such as highermaintenance expenses, operating income, or utilities that may deter them from purchasing a specific property.\n\nThe ideal OER is between 60% and 80% (although the lower it is, the better).\n\nOER=Total\u00a0operating\u00a0expensesTotal\u00a0revenue\\begin{aligned}&OER=\\frac{\\text{Total operating expenses}}{\\text{Total revenue}}\\end{aligned}\u200bOER=Total\u00a0revenueTotal\u00a0operating\u00a0expenses\u200b\u200b\n\nIn order to calculate the OER for a property, you need to know the operating expenses. These include all fees and costs incurred as the normal costs of doing business. You will also need to calculate the property'sdepreciation expense, which will vary by the particular accounting method employed.What the Operating Expense Ratio (OER) Can Tell YouCalculating OERs over a number of years may help an investor notice a property\u2019s trends in operating expenses. If a property\u2019s costs increase annually at a greater rate than income, the OER increases annually as well. Therefore, the investor may lose more money the longer they hold the property.When owning an apartment building, an investor should figure in vacancies by using effectiverental income, or potential rental income minus vacancy and credit losses, rather than potential rental income.Because managing vacancies is included in efficient property management, including vacancies in an OER gives a more accurate picture of operating expenses and shows where improvements may be made. For example, a poorly managed property will most likely have higher vacancy rates, which will be reflected in the OER.Property management fees, utilities, trash removal, maintenance, insurance, repairs, property taxes, and other costs are included in OERs.Additionaloperating expensesthat investors should figure into the OER include property management fees, landscaping, attorney fees, landlord\u2019s insurance, and basic property insurance. These costs help run the property on a daily basis. For this reason, loan payments, capital improvements, and personal property are excluded from operating expenses.A lower OER typically means the property is being managed efficiently and is more profitable for investors, and that less of the property\u2019s income is covering operational and maintenance costs.If the business is scalable, the owner may increase the rent on each unit without greatly increasing operating expenses. In addition, the OER can show where potential issues may occur, such as utility bills increasing substantially, so investors can solve problems more quickly and protect their profit levels.Example of How to Use the OERTake a hypothetical example, where Investor A owns a multi-family apartment building and brings in $65,000 per month in rent. The investor also pays $50,000 for operating expenses including their monthly mortgage payments, taxes, utilities, and so on. The property also is expected to depreciate by $85,000 this year.Therefore, the annual OER can be calculated as:[($50,000\u00d712)\u221285,000](65,000\u00d712)=66%\\frac{[(\\$50,000 \\times 12) - 85,000]} {(65,000 \\times 12)} = 66\\%(65,000\u00d712)[($50,000\u00d712)\u221285,000]\u200b=66%This means that operating expenses consume approximately two-thirds of revenues generated by this property.OER vs. Capitalization RateThecapitalization rateis used\u00a0in the world of commercial real estate to indicate therate of returnthat is expected to be generated on a\u00a0real estate investment\u00a0property.Often\u00a0referred to as the \"cap rate,\"\u00a0this measurement is computed based on the\u00a0net\u00a0income\u00a0that the property is expected to generate. It is used to estimate the investor's potential return on investment in the real estate market.The cap rate simply represents the yield of a property over a one-year time horizon (assuming the property is purchased on cash and not on loan). It is defined by the formula:Cap\u00a0rate=net\u00a0operating\u00a0income\u00f7current\u00a0market\u00a0value\\text{Cap rate} = \\text{net operating income} \\div \\text{current market value}Cap\u00a0rate=net\u00a0operating\u00a0income\u00f7current\u00a0market\u00a0valueWhile the cap rate is similar to OER in terms of measuring the profitability of an investment property, it differs from the OER in that it uses gross revenue rather than net income and places that in the denominator. OER also does not take into account the market value of a property.Limitations of Using the OERThere are two drawbacks to the OER for real estate investors. First, because it does not include the market value of a property, it does not inform an investor about the relative value of a property at purchase or sale. It only speaks to the efficiency of ongoing operations.Thus, the OER should be used in conjunction with something like the capitalization rate when evaluating a property investment.Second, because depreciation can be calculated in several different ways, the OER can be gamed by using a more favorable method of accounting for depreciation.What Is a Good Operating Expense Ratio?Good operating expense ratios range between 60% and 80%. The lower the operating expense ratio, the better an investment it is.What Are Operating Expenses in Real Estate?In real estate, operating expenses are the cost to keep a property running. These are recurring costs to ensure that a property remains in good condition. Examples of operating expenses are repairs and maintenance, insurance, taxes, and property management costs.How Do You Calculate the Operating Expense Ratio?The operating expense ratio is calculated by subtracting depreciation from operating expenses and dividing the number by gross revenue. Operating Expense Ratio = (Operating Expenses - Depreciation) / Gross Revenue.The Bottom LineThe operating expense ratio (OER) compares the income a property brings in to the cost of running that property. This allows investors to see if a property would be a good investment, and how much return they can expect, as well as helping them compare to other potential property investments.\n\nCalculating OERs over a number of years may help an investor notice a property\u2019s trends in operating expenses.
