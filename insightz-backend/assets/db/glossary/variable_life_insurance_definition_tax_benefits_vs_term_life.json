  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nVariable life insurance is a permanent life insurance product with separate accounts comprised of various instruments and investment funds, such as stocks, bonds, equity funds, money market funds, and bond funds.\n\nIn some ways, variable life insurance can be described as a form of securities. Why? Because of investment risks, variable policies are considered securities contracts.They are regulated under the federal securities laws.\u00a0Following the federal\u00a0regulations, sales professionals must provide aprospectusof available investment products to potential buyers.\n\nVariable life insurance policies have specific tax benefits, such as thetax-deferredaccumulation of earnings. Provided the policy remains in force, policyholders may access the cash value via a tax-free loan. However, unpaid loans, including principal and interest, reduce the death benefit. Additionally, interest or earnings included in partial and full surrenders\u00a0of the policy are taxable at the time of distribution.\n\nAn attractive feature of the\u00a0variable life insurance product is its flexibility regarding premium remittance and cash value accumulation. Premiums are not fixed, as with traditional whole life insurance or term insurance policies. Within limits, policyholders may adjust their\u00a0premium payments based on their needs and investment goals.\n\nLoan interest may become taxable upon surrender of the policy.\n\nFor example, if the policyholder remits a premium less than what is needed to sustain the policy, the accumulated cash value compensates for the difference. Although variable life insurance offers this flexibility, it is essential to understand that long-term remittance of reduced premiums can compromise the cash value and the overall status of the policy. Alternatively, policyholders may remit greater premium payments to increase their cash value and investment holdings.\n\nUnlikewhole life insurance, the death benefit is linked to the performance of the separate account funds.\u00a0A positive aggregate performance could offer increased financial protection to the beneficiary upon the death of the insured.\n\nIn addition to the policy's flexibility, the potential for significant investment earnings is another attractive feature. Many policies offer a wide array of investment options ranging from a conservative approach\u00a0to anaggressive\u00a0strategy, to suit the needs of most investors.\n\nAs an added bonus, a few of the\u00a0best life insurance companies, such as Prudential and New York Life, offer variable life insurance plans.\n\nCompared to other life insurance policies, variable life insurance is typically more expensive. Premiums paid help cover administrative fees and the\u00a0management of the plan's investments.\u00a0The policyholder may need to increase payments to keep the policy active or to maintain a specific death benefit according to the performance of investment products and the premiums remitted.\n\nAs a proactive measure, some policyholders submit premiums exceeding the cost of the insurance policy to ensure the guarantees of their policies. Additionally, the policyholder solely assumes all investment risks. The insurer offers no guarantees of performance nor protects against investment losses. The policyholder must exercise due diligence by remaining educated about investments and attentive to the separate account performance.\n\nLike most life insurance policies, individuals are required to undergofull medical underwritingto obtain a variable life insurance policy.\u00a0Those people with compromised health or those who have other unfavorable underwriting factors may not qualify for coverage or may realize higher premiums.\n\nIt has separate accounts comprised of different instruments and investment funds, such as stocks, bonds, equity funds, money market funds, and bond funds. Because of investment risks, variable policies are considered securities contracts. They are regulated under the federal securities laws.\u00a0Following the federal\u00a0regulations, sales professionals must provide aprospectusof available investment products to potential buyers.\n\nThe policy owner chooses how to invest their cash value. Many policies offer a wide array of investment options ranging from a conservative approach\u00a0to an aggressive\u00a0strategy, to suit the needs of most investors. This might mean returns that surpass those of other insurance policies.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cInvestor Bulletin: Variable Life Insurance.\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cNotice to Members 00-44: The NASD Reminds Members of Their Responsibilities Regarding the Sale of Variable Life Insurance.\u201d",
