  "term": "Barter (or Bartering) Definition, Uses, and Example",
  "definition": "Barter is the exchange of one item or service for another of similar value without using cash or a cash equivalent for payment.\n\nBartering involves the provision of a good or service by one party when payment is made in the form of providing another good or service from another party.\u00a0A carpenter might build a fence for a farmer who would give the carpenter $1,000 worth of crops or foodstuffs for the labor and materials rather than $1,000 in cash. No money or monetary equivalent such as acredit cardchanges hands.\n\nBartering is based on a simple concept: Two individuals negotiate to determine the relative value of their goods and services and offer them to one another in an even exchange. It is the oldest form of commerce, dating back to a time beforehard currencyeven existed.\n\nWhile the current senior\u00a0generation bartered with the limited goods they had on hand (i.e., produce and\u00a0livestock)\u00a0or services they could personally render (i.e., carpentry and\u00a0tailoring) to someone they knew, today most Americans have access to a nearly unlimited source of potential bartering partners through\u00a0the internet.\n\nVirtually any item or service can be bartered if the parties involved agree to the terms of the trade. Individuals, companies, and countries can all benefit from such cashless exchanges, particularly\u00a0if they lack hard currency to obtain goods and services.\n\nWhile it is mostly associated with commerce during ancient times, bartering has been reinvented in this era through the internet.\n\nBartering allows individuals to trade items that they own but are not using for items that they need,\u00a0while keeping their cash on hand for expenses that cannot be paid through\u00a0bartering, such as amortgage, medical bills, andutilities.\n\nBartering can have a psychological benefit\u00a0because\u00a0it can create a deeper personal relationship between trading partners than a typical monetized transaction. Bartering can also help people build professional networks and market their businesses.\n\nIn an economic crunch, bartering\u00a0can be a great way to get the goods and services you need without having to pull money out of your pocket.\n\nOn a broader level, bartering can result in the optimal allocation of resources by exchanging goods in quantities that represent\u00a0similar values. Bartering\u00a0can also help economies achieveequilibrium, which occurs when demand equals supply.\n\nWhen two people each have items the other wants, both parties can determine the values of the items and provide the amount that results in an optimal allocation of resources.\n\nFor instance, if an individual has 20 pounds of rice that they value at $10, they can exchange it with another individual who needs rice and who has something that the individual wants that's valued at $10. A person can also exchange an item for something that the individual\u00a0does not need because there is a ready market to dispose of that item.\n\nCompanies may want to barter their products for other products because they do not have the credit or cash to buy those goods. It is an efficient way to trade because therisks of\u00a0foreign exchangeare eliminated.\n\nThe most common contemporary example ofbusiness-to-business(B2B)barter transactionsis an exchange of advertising time or space; it is typical for smaller firms to trade the rights to advertise on each others' business spaces.\u00a0Bartering also occurs among\u00a0companies and individuals. For example, an accounting firm can provide an accounting report for an electrician in exchange for having its offices rewired by the\u00a0electrician.\n\nCountries also engage in bartering when they are deeply in debt and are unable to obtainfinancing. Goods are exported in exchange for goods that the country needs. In this way, countries managetrade deficitsand reduce the amount of debt they incur.\n\nThe estimated annual dollar range of barter transactions in the U.S., according to the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA).\n\nOnline barter exchanges became especially popular with small businesses after the 2008 financial crisis, which culminated in theGreat Recession. As prospects and sales dwindled, small businesses increasingly turned to barter exchanges to generaterevenue. These exchanges enabled members to find new customers for their products and get access to goods and services using unusedinventory.\n\nThe exchanges also used custom currency, which could be hoarded and used to purchase services such as hotel stays during vacations. The barter economy during the financial crisis was estimated to have touched $3 billion.\n\nThere have been several other examples of bartering growing in popularity during times of economic uncertainty.\u00a0For instance, in 2020, a year associated with COVID-19-enforced lockdowns, the BBC reported that bartering in the United Kingdom had become much more widespread. Moreover, in 2022, it was reported that frustrated Argentines, against a backdrop of high inflation and low wages, introduced barter fairs in and around Buenos Aires.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service(IRS) considers bartering a form of revenue and something that must be reported astaxable income.\n\nUnder the U.S.'sgenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP), businesses are expected to estimate thefair market valueof their bartered goods or services. This is done by referring to past cash transactions of similar goods or services and using that historical revenue as a reportable value. When it is not possible to accurately calculate the value, most bartered goods are reported based on theircarrying value.\n\nFor the IRS, estimatedbarter dollars are identical to real dollarsfor tax purposes, which means that barter arrangements are considered the same as cash payments. The barter dollars are reported asincomeand taxed in thefiscal yearin which the barter occurred.\n\nThe IRS further distinguishes between different forms of bartering, and there are slightly different rules for each type.Most nonmonetary business income is reported onForm 1040, Schedule C\u2014Profit or Loss from Business.\n\nSince bartering has tax implications, it's worth consulting a tax professional before making any significant commitments.\n\nSo how can an individual successfully barter? Here are some tips:\n\nWhat items do you have that you could easily part with? Use a critical eye to go through your home, and consider possessions you may have in storage or that another family member or friend is currently using. If you would prefer to offer services, honestly assess what you could provide for others that they would otherwise pay a professional to do. It could be a skill, a\u00a0talent, or even a hobby such as photography.\n\nSuccessful bartering must result in the satisfaction of both parties. This\u00a0can only happen if the items bartered are realistically valued. If you have an item you would\u00a0like to trade, obtain\u00a0an accurateappraisal. An item is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Therefore, do your research and look at the\u00a0\"selling\" section on eBay to find out what online buyers have paid for similar items.\n\nTo value a service, call around for local estimates from professionals to find out\u00a0how competitively you can price your abilities. Remember to be honest about your skills and to factor in costs associated with the exchange; for example, shipping (for goods) or materials (for trading a skill).\n\nBe specific about\u00a0what you\u00a0are looking for in a barter exchange. In addition to specific items you may need, here is a list of potential services that you could barter for:\n\nAfter you know what you have to offer\u00a0and exactly what you need/want in a barter situation, find a barter partner. If you don't have a specific person or business in mind, try word of mouth. Let your friends, colleagues, and social network know about your specific need and what you want in a barter situation.\n\nCheck online\u00a0swap markets and onlineauctionsthat have a bartering component, such as\u00a0Craigslist.com (check under \"For Sale\" for the Bartering category), Swapace.com, and BarterQuest.com. Also, check for local bartering clubs. Your localchamber of commercemay be able to provide you with information on similar\u00a0clubs in your area.\n\nAfter you've found a barter partner, get the agreement in writing. Make sure you detail what services or goods will be involved, the date of the exchange (or work to be done),\u00a0and any recourse if either party reneges on their part of the deal. If you are\u00a0working through a membership-based bartering association, they will likely provide all the structure and paperwork you need for\u00a0the deal.\n\nBartering does have its limitations. Much bigger (i.e., chain) businesses will not\u00a0entertain the idea and even smaller organizations may limit the dollar amount of goods or services for which they will barter\u2014they may not agree to a 100% barter arrangement and instead require that you make at least partial payment.\n\nSome businesses that may not directly barter\u00a0with customers might swap goods or services through membership-based trading exchanges such as\u00a0ITEX or International Monetary Systems (IMS). By joining a trading network which often charges fees, members can trade with other members for barter \"dollars.\" Each transaction is subject to\u00a0a minimal fee; the exchange facilitates the swap and manages\u00a0the tax components\u00a0of bartering,\u00a0such as issuing 1099-B forms to participating members.\n\nYou may find a nearby exchange through the International Reciprocal Trade Association (IRTA) Member Directory. Before you sign up and pay for a membership, however, make sure that members offer the types of goods and services you need. Otherwise, you may find yourself\u00a0with barter money or credit that you cannot\u00a0use.\n\nA barter transaction could occur, say, between a plumber and a copywriter. In this example, the plumber goes to the writer\u2019s house to fix some leaking pipes and then rather than asking for payment asks the writer to help pen some promotional materials for the plumber\u2019s business instead. What we are witnessing here is one service (plumbing work) being exchanged for another (writing) without any money changing hands.\n\nBartering is legal in many countries in the world provided that it's carried out correctly. Issues can arise when exchanges aren\u2019t declared to local tax authorities, in which case the bartering transaction becomes illegal.\n\nAbsolutely. The use of a cashless exchange system is still flourishing today. Examples of modern forms of bartering includetime banking, childcare cooperatives, and house-sitting.\n\nBartering is often associated with underdeveloped economies, medieval markets, and times of old. However, in reality, this ancient custom continues to flourish throughout the world.\n\nGoods or services of similar value are regularly exchanged without cash changing hands from the United States of America all the way to China. And technological developments such as the internet have made it easier than ever before to find potential bartering partners and useful services to exchange for.\n\nInternational Reciprocal Trade Association. \"The Barter and Trade Industry.\"\n\nThe New York Times. \"The Cash-Strapped Turn to Barter.\"\n\nBBC. \"Could Bartering Become the New Buying in a Changed World?\"\n\nThe Associated Press. \"Bartering Increases in Argentina as Inflation Keeps Soaring.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 420 Bartering Income.\"\n\nDeloitte. \"Issue No. 93-11: Accounting for Barter Transactions Involving Barter Credits.\" Pages 1-3.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525 (2023), Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Schedule C (Form 1040).\"",
