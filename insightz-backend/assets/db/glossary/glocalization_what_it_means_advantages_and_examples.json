  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nGlocalization\u00a0is a combination of the words \"globalization\" and \"localization.\" The term is used to describe a product or service that is developed and distributed globally but is also adjusted to accommodate the user or consumer in a local market.\n\nA common example would be cars that are sold worldwide but adjusted to meet local criteria such as emissions standards or what side the steering wheel is located. It could also focus on more cultural aspects, such as a global fast-food chain offering geographically specific menu items that cater to local tastes.\n\nOften,\u00a0glocalization\u00a0campaigns involve culturally friendly media andad campaignsto encourage\u00a0the acceptance of foreign products among a local audience.\n\nGlocalization is the adaptation of global and international products into the local contexts they're used and sold in. The term was coined in\u00a0the Harvard Business Review, in 1980, by sociologist Roland Robertson, who wrote that glocalization meant \"the simultaneity\u2014the co-presence\u2014of both universalizing and particularizing tendencies.\"\n\nIn regards to a particular product or\u00a0service, this means the adaptation of\u00a0globally marketed products and services into local markets. A\u00a0global product or service, something everyone needs and can get use out of, may be tailored to conform to local laws, customs, or consumer preferences.\n\nProducts that are \"glocalized\" are, by definition, going to be of much greater interest to the end user, the person who ends up using the product.\u00a0This is because, while it's something that everyone can use and has use for as a global product, its localization makes it more specific to an individual, their context, and their needs.\n\nWhile glocalization helps customize an international corporation's products to a particular culture or geography, companies must also pay attention to the risk of perceived cultural appropriation.\n\nGlocalization works for companies withdecentralized authoritystructures and for companies that exist and compete in multiple, different cultural contexts. The process can be expensive and resource-intensive, but it often pays off for companies that practice it, as it allows for greater access to a larger, more culturally varied target market. It also makes those companies more effective competitors in those markets.\n\nIf globalization was charged with cultural homogenization, glocalization\u00a0andmulticultural organizationsare something of an answer to it. Glocalization\u00a0can be\u00a0thought of as the opposite, or the inverse, of\u00a0Americanization (sometimes called McDonaldization), too,\u00a0which is the influence that American culture and business have on another country's\u00a0culture.\n\nGlocalization is when an international corporation modifies some of its offerings in order to accommodate local consumer tastes or preferences. It is a portmanteau of the words \"globalization\" and \"localization.\"\n\nGlocalization comes in many forms. For instance, in the U.K., car producers must build vehicles with the steering wheel on the right side instead of the left. Food items are also changed in different countries to fit local tastes. McDonald's Corporation (MCD) and other fast-food chains will often serve up versions of local fare along with the core menu of hamburgers and chicken products.Brand image and marketing campaigns are also carried out in local languages and with local customs and cultural cues in mind.\n\nGlobalization is the spread of products, ideas, and capital across international borders by corporations. One criticism of globalization is that it can result in the homogenization of cultures and consumers around the world. Glocalization pays attention to local practices, customs, and culture to have these products better fit regional wants and needs.\n\nGlocalization efforts have produced mixed results for the larger economy. In making global companies more effective competitors against domestic players, glocalization should increase the quality of competition and\u00a0drive down prices, making goods more accessible. However, since glocalization is generally the practice of largemultinational corporations, driving the price down and taking a big share of the market, the process can hurt smaller, local businesses, which struggle to compete with these corporations' low costs of production. This can result in less competition, with the result of driving prices up.\n\nRoudometof, Victor.Glocalization: A critical introduction.
