Among the advantages provided by the exemption can be streamlinedfinancial statementswithout audit obligations, three possible format choices to use to arrange theoffering circular, and no requirement to provide Exchange Act reports until the company has more than 500 shareholders and $10 million in assets.\n\nUpdates to Regulation A in 2015 allow companies to generate income under two different tiers. It's essential for investors interested in purchasing securities sold by companies utilizing Regulation A to understand which tier the security was offered.\n\nEvery company must indicate the tier under which the security falls on the front of its disclosure document or offering circular. This is important because the two tiers represent two different types of investments.\n\nCompanies that use the Reg A exemption can sell their securities utilizing two different tiers, each with its own requirements. However, with both tiers, the issuer must file an offering statement with the SEC, including an offering circular, which serves as the disclosure document for investors.\n\nUnder Tier 1, a company is permitted to offer a maximum of $20 million in a 12-month period.\n\nThe issuing company must also file offering statements with the SEC, which need to be qualified by state regulators in the states in which the company plans on selling the securities.\n\nHowever, companies issuing offerings under Tier 1 do not have ongoing reporting requirements but are required to issue a report on the final status of the offering.\n\nUnder Tier 2, companies can offer up to $75 million in a 12-month period.\n\nCompanies offering securities under Tier 2 are required to produce audited financial statements and file continual reports, including its final status.\n\nHowever, Tier 2 issuers are not required to register or qualify their offerings with state securities regulators but still must file their offering with the SEC.\n\nTier 2 offerings have additional requirements such as limitations on the amount of money anon-accreditedinvestor may invest in a Tier 2 security.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Regulation A.\" Accessed Oct. 10, 2021.",
