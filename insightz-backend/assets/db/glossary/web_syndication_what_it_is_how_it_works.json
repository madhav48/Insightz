  "term": "Web Syndication: What It is, How It Works",
  "definition": "Web syndication is amarketing strategyfor websites that grants a right or license to broadcast or distribute content from one site to another. The most common example of\u00a0web syndication is a contentlicensing arrangementbetween two or more Internet companies in which one company provides content to be published and promoted on the other's website.\n\nWeb syndication\u00a0is generally a free arrangement that's\u00a0equally and mutually beneficial to both parties. Syndication increases the exposure of the website that provides the content and it may provide considerably more traffic for very little to no cost. The practice\u00a0can make the content syndicator's websites more attractive to users by providing more in-depth information.\n\nThis\u00a0relationship is especially common between niche, low-traffic, content-producing websites and larger websites that have large,\u00a0built-in audiences, but they may not have the capability to create specialized, in-depth content.\n\nWeb syndication is the online version of content sharing that's been going on since the early days of print,\u00a0radio, and television.\n\nWhen a show originally aired in the early days of television, it was produced by and shown on just one network. The original network licensed it out or syndicated it after the show's conclusion, allowing another network to air it for a fee.\n\nThe one element that guides all syndication is the ability to access\u00a0a larger audience for whatever content is being syndicated.\n\nWeb syndication is a key tool in link building. The links embedded in a\u00a0piece of syndicated content will drive traffic back to the originating website with search engine optimization\u00a0(SEO).\u00a0The additional web traffic that syndication can\u00a0provide can help the content-providing website improve its search results and overall site ranking in an Internet search.\n\nWeb syndication may allow the company providing the content\u00a0to earn additional page views and exposure to its content and its website. The benefits for the site hosting the provided material are fresh content to appeal to consumers and additional traffic. Web syndication is also sometimes referred to as \"content syndication.\"\n\nA website might sometimes want to pay for syndication to get its material placed in a specific location on a high-traffic site. The bigger the distributor's site, the greater the fee usually is. Such distributors include Yahoo and\u00a0Google, as well associal mediaplatforms like Facebook and\u00a0X (formerlyTwitter).\n\nThere are also content syndication networks that can help bloggers spread their content. These are often seen at the bottom of web pages as \"related posts\" or \"similar articles from around the web\" and they include providers such as Outbrain, Nativo,\u00a0Zemanta, and Taboola.\n\nIt's usually noted on the platform when a content-producing site pays for traffic. It may be stated that the content is an \"ad\" or \"sponsored\" on social media and similarly on search page results. The post or content might be at the top of the page and noted as a \"sponsored ad.\"\n\nThe cost of paying for traffic is significantly less than the traditional cost of advertising space on radio or television. It costs just a few dollars to advertise content onFacebookor Instagram, but this is different from true web syndication that relies on licensing agreements.\n\nThe distributing site attracts more users because it's able to provide more content. The content site also increases its traffic and exposure.\n\nWeb syndication is often free but sometimes a fee is charged by high-traffic sites. The fee usually increases based on the size of the distributor's site because the content provider is paying for traffic. Paying for syndication can ensure premium placement on a high-traffic site and the fee is often less than paying for advertising.\n\nIt depends on the distributor. Product videos, images and descriptions are typically accepted. The distributor should tell you upfront what it will or will not accept, but it may simply adjust your copy and images to meet its standards.\n\nWeb syndication is a content licensing agreement between Internet companies. One company provides content to be published and promoted on the other company's website, sometimes in exchange for a fee. The arrangement can provide benefits to both parties, and the cost can be much less than standard advertising on radio or television or in print media.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Syndication: The Emerging Model for Business in the Internet Era.\"\n\nPathfinder SEO. \"What Is Content Syndication & How Does It Impact SEO?\"\n\nWizard of Ads.org. \"Finding the Right Mix of Organic and Paid Traffic.\"",
