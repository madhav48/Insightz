Most transfers take only a matter of minutes, and they usually come with a fee.\n\nFor example, a migrant from a lower-income country might move to the U.S. and get a job. They then send back a quarter of their monthly paycheck to their family by going to the bank and initiating a wire transfer. Their family might use the money to pay for things like housing, food, or supplies. The family might also use the funds to open bank accounts, helping them become more financially secure.\n\nThe use ofremittanceshas grown significantly since the late 1990s.In some developing countries or countries with struggling economies, remittances are one of the biggest sources of income for citizens.
