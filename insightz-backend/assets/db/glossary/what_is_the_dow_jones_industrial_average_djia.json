  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) tracks thirty of America's biggest and most established companies, acting like a quick temperature check of the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is a stock market index that tracks 30 large, publicly owned blue-chip companies trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq. The Dow Jones is named after Charles Dow, who created the index in 1896 with his business partner, Edward Jones. Also referred to as the Dow 30, the index is considered a gauge of the broader U.S. economy.\n\nThe DJIA is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. The DJIA was designed to serve as a proxy for the health of the broader U.S. economy. Often referred to simply as the Dow, it is one of the most-watched stock market indexes in the world. While the Dow includes a range of companies, all can be described asblue chipcompanies with consistently stable earnings.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the performance of industrial companies was typically tied to the overall growth rate in the economy. That cemented the relationship between the Dow's performance and the overall economy. Even today, for many investors, a strong-performing Dow equals a strong economy, while a weak-performing Dow generally means a slowing economy.\n\nAs the economy changes over time, so does the index's composition. A part of the Dow may be dropped when a company becomes less relevant to current trends of the economy, to be replaced by a new name that better reflects the shift. For instance, a company may be removed from the index when itsmarket capitalizationdrops because of financial distress.\n\nStocks with higher share prices are given greater weight in the index. So, a higher percentage move in a higher-priced component will have a greater impact on the final calculated value. At the Dow's inception, Charles Dow calculated the average by adding the prices of the 12 Dow component stocks and dividing by 12. The result was a simple average. Over time, additions and subtractions to the index had to be accounted for, such as mergers and stock splits. At that point, a simple mean calculation no longer made sense.\n\nTheDow divisorwas created to address the simple average issue. The divisor is a predetermined constant that is used to determine the effect of a one-point move in any of the about 30 stocks that comprise the Dow. There have been instances when the divisor needed to be changed so that the value of the Dow stayed consistent. As of 2024, the Dow Divisor was 0.15265312230608.\n\nThe Dow is not calculated using a weighted arithmetic average and doesn't represent its component companies' market cap, unlike the S&P 500. Rather, it reflects the sum of the price of one share of stock for all the components, divided by the divisor. Thus, a one-point move in any of the component stocks will move the index by an identical number of points.\n\nThe S&P 500 has outperformed the DJIA on an annualized basis over the last three-, five-, and 10-year periods.\n\nThe DJIA launched in 1896 with just 12 companies, primarily in the industrial sector. They included railroads, cotton, gas, sugar, tobacco, and oil. The index grew to 30 components by 1928. Since then, it's changed many times\u2014the very first came three months after the 30-component index launched. The first large-scale change was in 1932 when eight stocks in the Dow were replaced.\n\nThe Dow is reevaluated regularly. Companies are replaced when they no longer meet the index's listing criteria with those that do. Over time, the index became abellwetherof the U.S. economy, reflecting economic changes. For example, U.S. Steel was removed from the index in 1991 and replaced by building material company Martin Marietta.\n\nAs the index is reevaluated, major changes to the DJIA can occur over time:\n\nThese latest changes mark just the 53rd adjustment to the DJIA since its inception in 1896 and highlight a shift toward companies that are more relevant in their respective industries.\n\nThe following are some important historical milestones achieved by the Dow:\n\nIndividuals can invest in the Dow, which would mean gaining exposure to all of the companies listed in it, through\u00a0exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as the SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF (DIA).\n\nMany critics argue that the Dow doesn't truly represent the state of the whole U.S. economy, given that it consists only of 30 large-cap U.S. companies. They believe the number of companies is too small and argue it neglects companies of different sizes. Many critics believe the S&P 500 better represents the economy as it includes significantly more companies.\n\nCritics also believe that factoring only the price of a stock in the calculation does not accurately reflect a company, as much as considering a company's market cap would. In this manner, a company with a higher stock price but a smaller market cap would have more weight than a company with a smaller stock price but a larger market cap, which would poorly reflect the true size of a company.\n\nThe Dow is also aprice-weighted indexinstead of being weighted by market capitalization. This means that stocks in the index with higher share prices have greater influence, even if they are smaller companies overall in terms of market value. In a price-weighted index, a stock that increases from $110 to $120 will have the same net effect on the index as a stock that increases from $10 to $20, even though the percentage move for the latter is far greater than that of the higher-priced stock.\u00a0This also means that stock splits can impact the index, while they would not for amarket cap-weighted index.\n\nThe DJIAtracks the price movementsof 30 large companies in the U.S.. Such companies include Microsoft and Home Depot. The selected companies are from all major U.S. sectors, except utilities and transportation.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average hit 10,000 for the first time in March 1999. The DJIA then hit 11,750 in January 2000, before falling to below 7,200 in October 2002 after the dot-com crash.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is made up of 30 large stocks. All the stocks are based in the United States. The DJIA is also known as the Dow 30.\n\nThe S&P 500 and DJIA are the two most-watched stock indexes in the U.S. However, these twobenchmarks are very different:\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock index of 30 U.S. blue-chip large-cap companies, which has become synonymous with the American stock market as a whole. The index, however, only has 30 companies, and the index is price-weighted, meaning that it doesn't always present an accurate reflection of the broader stock market.\n\nCompanies in the DJIA are also chosen by a committee and are balanced to try torepresent the state of the overall economy. This means that certain companies may be added to or deleted from the index periodically, and it's difficult to predict when or which stock will be changed. Despite its limitations, however, the Dow still holds a special place in American finance.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Dow Jones Transportation Average.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Chapter 7, Icons: The S&P 500 and The Dow.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Dow Jones Industrial Average.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"How the Dow\u00ae Works.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Index Mathematics Methodology,\" Page 5.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P 500.\"\n\nDogs of the Dow. \"Dow Additions and Deletions Since 1929.\"\n\nCNBC. \"Back to the Future: A Visual Tour of the Dow 30 Index.\"\n\nYahoo!
