  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nKaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that aims to make small changes over time to drive ongoing improvement.\n\nThe Japanese concept of kaizen encompasses a wide range of ideas. They include making the work environment more efficient by creating a team atmosphere, improving processes and procedures, ensuringemployee engagement, and making jobs more fulfilling, less tiring, and safer. Many companies around the world now practice kaizen in one form or another.\n\nThe goal of kaizen is to make small changes over time to drive continuous improvement within a company. The kaizen process recognizes that small changes now can add up to huge impacts in the future.\n\nUltimately that can mean betterquality control, more efficient processes, and the elimination of waste, among other benefits.\n\nUnder kaizen, improvements can be initiated by any employee at any time. The philosophy is that everyone has a stake in the company's success and everyone should strive, at all times, to help make the business better.\n\nMany companies around the world have adopted the kaizen concept. Most famously, the automakerToyotahas long employed kaizen within its organization and describes it as one of its core values. To improve its production system, Toyota encourages and empowers all employees to identify areas of potential improvement and create viable solutions.\n\nToyota's process of identifying solutions is called \"kaizen blitz.\"\n\nKaizen is often broken down into a set of key principles.\n\nFor example, the Kaizen Institute, founded by Masaaki Imai, author of a 1986 book that helped popularize the term, lists them as:\n\nUnderlying kaizen is the recognition that the people who perform certain tasks and activities know the most about them. Empowering those people to effect change is the best strategy for improvement. Ideally, kaizen will become deeply ingrained in acompany's culture.\n\nKaizen posits that there is no perfect end and that everything can be improved upon, so people must strive to evolve and innovate constantly.\n\nTeamwork is core to kaizen, where regular team meetings involve discussions about possible improvements.\n\nKaizen offers companies many potential benefits. They include:\n\nThe improvement process used in kaizen often follows thePDCA cycleformat, first developed in the U.S. in the 1920s. PDCA stands for Plan-Do-Check-Act.\n\nThePlanphase includes proposing and mapping out changes so that everyone knows what to expect when teams try to solve a problem.\n\nTheDostage implements whatever appears to be the best solution for the problem.\n\nTheCheckstep involves evaluating the solution to the problem to see if it worked.\n\nWhen a companyActs, it determines whether or not the solution should become a company standard or if it needs further changes. If managers decide to implement more changes, kaizen goes back to thePlanstep and the process starts over again.\n\nOne of the key goals of the kaizen process is to reduce waste and increase efficiency in the production cycle. Ajust-in-time (JIT)inventory strategy allows management to minimize excess inventory by matching the delivery of raw materials from suppliers with production schedules.\n\nThe JIT strategy is part of the Toyota Production System (TPS), which is now used by numerous companies. JIT helps manufacturers save money by reducinginventory carrying costs. It also reduces waste because companies are not left with extra inventory should a customer cancel or postpone an order.\n\nAnother Japanese innovation,kanbanis an inventory control system used in conjunction with a JIT strategy. It provides employees with visual cues that tell them when it is time to order parts and materials as they run out.\n\nThe system relies on colored cards that track production and alert employees when it's time to replenish a needed part or material. It enables employees to quickly order the correct number of parts from the supplier and have them delivered to where they are needed in the factory.\n\nThe goal of kanban is to ensure the efficient running of the factory assembly line and to preventbottlenecksfrom occurring.\n\nThe Kaizen method is a set of guiding principles and tools that seek to involve all employees in gradual and continuous improvement throughout a company. As such, it is an ongoing process and one that never ends.\n\nToyota is probably the most famous example of a company using kaizen to sustain its success. Another well-known example of kaizen in action involves the Ford Motor Company, which embraced kaizen to cut the time it took to complete various manufacturing processes. A non-manufacturing example would beFidelity Investments, which adopted the concept years ago to improve its customer service.\n\nKaizen 5S is a five-step process often used inlean manufacturing. The steps are: Sort, Set in Order, Shine, Standardize, and Sustain.\n\nSix Sigma, like kaizen, is a methodology for improving business processes, reducing waste, and improving quality control. It was introduced by the U.S. manufacturer Motorola in 1986, around the same time that kaizen was gaining worldwide attention.\n\nKaizen is both a philosophy and a practical system for facilitating continuous improvement in a company. From its beginnings in Japan, largely as a way to improve manufacturing processes, it has spread across the world and into many different types of industries.\n\nToyota. \"Toyota Production System.\"\n\nKaizen Institute. \"What Is Kaizen: Dive Into the Kaizen Methodology.\"\n\nToyota. \"Muda, Muri, Mura \u2013 Toyota Production System Guide.\"\n\nKaizen Consulting Group. \"Kaizen.\"\n\nToyota. \"How Does Just-in-Time Production Work?\"\n\nJStor. \"Adventures of a Contrarian.\"\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. \"Lean Thinking and Methods \u2013 5S.\"",
