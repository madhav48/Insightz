  "term": "Balanced Fund: Definition, Investment Mix, Examples",
  "definition": "A balanced fund is amutual fundthat typically contains a component of stocks and bonds. A mutual fund is a basket of securities in which investors can purchase. Typically, balanced funds stick to a fixedasset allocationof stocks and bonds, such as 70% stocks and 30%bonds. Bonds are debt instruments that usually pay a stable, fixed rate of return.\n\nThe investment objective for a balanced mutual fund tends to be amixture of growth and income, which leads to the balanced nature of the fund. Balanced mutual funds are geared toward investors who are looking for a mixture of safety, income, and modest capital appreciation.\n\nA balanced fund is a type ofhybrid fund,which is an investment fund characterized by its diversification among two or more asset classes. The amounts the fund invests into eachasset classusually must remain within a set minimum and maximum value. Another name for a balanced fund is an asset allocation fund.\n\nBalanced fund portfolios do not materially change their asset mix, unlikelife-cycle funds, which adjust the holdings to lower the risk as an investor's retirement date approaches. Balanced funds also differ from actively managed funds, which may evolve in response to the investor's changing risk-return appetite or overall investment market conditions.\n\nRetirees or investors with low-risk tolerancecan utilize balanced funds for healthy growth and supplemental income. The elements of balanced funds include a mixture of stocks and bonds.\n\nTheequitycomponent helps to prevent erosion of purchasing power and ensure the long-term preservation of retirement nest eggs.\n\nThe equity holdings of a balanced fund lean toward large equities such as the ones found in theS&P 500 Index, which contains 500 of the largest\u00a0publicly traded companies in the United States.\u00a0Balanced funds may also includedividend-paying companies. Dividends are cash payments made by companies to their shareholders as a reward for owning their stock. Companies that consistently pay dividends over the long term tend to be well-established and profitable.\n\nThe bond component of a balanced fund serves two purposes.\n\nInvestment-gradebonds such as AAAcorporate debtand U.S.Treasuriesprovide interest income through semi-annual payments, while large-company stocks offer quarterly dividend payouts to enhance yield. Also, rather than reinvest distributions, retired investors may receive cash to bolster their income from pensions, personal savings, and government subsidies.\n\nWhile they trade daily, highly graded bonds and Treasuries don't usually experience wild price swings that equities may experience. As a result, the stability of the fixed-interest securities prevents wild jumps in the share price of a balanced mutual fund. Also, debt security prices do not move in lockstep with stocks and can move in the opposite direction. This bond stability provides balanced funds with ballast, further smoothing out its portfolio's investment return over time.\n\nBalanced funds are the same as asset allocation funds.\n\nBecause balanced funds rarely have to change their mix of stocks and bonds, they tend to have lower totalexpense ratios(ERs), which represent the cost of the fund. Moreover, because they automatically spread an investor's money across a variety of types of stocks, market risk is minimized if certain stocks or sectorsunderperform. Finally, balanced funds allow investors to withdraw money periodically without upsetting the asset allocation.\n\nDiversified, constantly rebalanced portfolio\n\nUnsuited for tax-shielding strategies\n\n\"The usual suspects\" investments\n\nOn the downside, the fund controls the asset allocation, not the investor, which might not match an investor's tax-planning strategy. For example, many investors prefer to keep income-producing securities in tax-advantaged accounts and growth stocks in taxable ones, but you can't separate the two in a balanced fund. Also, investors can't use abond ladderingstrategy\u2014buying bonds with staggered maturity dates\u2014to adjust cash flows and repayment of principal according to their financial situation.\n\nThe characteristic allocation of a balanced fund\u2014usually 60% equities, 40% bonds\u2014may not always suit an investor's financial goals since needs and preferences can change over time. Some balanced funds play it too safe, avoiding international or outside-the-mainstream markets, which can hobble their returns.\n\nThe Vanguard Balanced Index Fund Admiral Shares (VBIAX) has a below-average risk rating from Morningstar with an above-average reward profile.The fund's allocation consists of 60% stocks and 40% bonds.
