  "term": "Accounting Information System (AIS): Definition and Benefits",
  "definition": "An accounting information system (AIS) involves the collection, storage, and processing of financial and accounting data used by internal users to report information toinvestors,creditors, and tax authorities. It is generally a computer-based method for tracking accounting activity in conjunction with information technology resources.\n\nAn AIS combines traditionalaccounting practices, such as the use ofgenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), with modern information technology (IT) resources.\n\nAn accounting information system contains various elements that are important in theaccounting cycle. Although the information contained in a system varies among industries and business sizes, a typical AIS includes data relating torevenue,expenses, customer information, employee information, and tax information. Specific data includes sales orders and analysis reports, purchase requisitions, invoices, check registers, inventory, payroll, ledger, trial balance, and financial statement information.\n\nAn accounting information system must have a database structure to store information. This database structure is typically programmed\u00a0with query language that allows for table and data manipulation.\n\nAn AIS has numerous fields to input data and edit previously stored data. In addition, accounting information systems are often highly secured platforms, with preventative measures taken against viruses, hackers, and other external sources attempting to collect information.\n\nThe various outputs of an accounting information system exemplify the versatility of its data manipulation capabilities. An AIS produces reports includingaccounts receivableaging reports based on customer information,depreciationschedules for fixed assets, andtrial balancesfor financial reporting. Customer lists, taxation calculations, and inventory levels may also be reproduced.\n\nHowever, correspondences, memos, or presentations are not included in the AIS because these items are not directly related to a company\u2019s financial reporting or bookkeeping.\n\nAn accounting information system strives to interface across multiple departments. Within the system, the sales department can upload the sales budget, for example. This information is used by the inventory management team to conductinventorycounts and purchase materials.\n\nUpon the purchase of inventory, the system can notify theaccounts payabledepartment of the new invoice. An AIS can also share information about a new order so that the manufacturing, shipping, and customer service departments are aware of the sale.\n\nAn integral part of accounting information systems relates tointernal controls. Policies and procedures can be placed within the system to ensure that sensitive customer, vendor, and business information is maintained within a company. Through the use of physical access approvals, login requirements, access logs, authorizations, and segregation of duties, users can be limited to only the relevant information necessary to perform their business function.\n\nAn AIS combines modern information technology (IT) resources with traditional accounting practices, such as the use of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nCybersecurityis increasingly important as more and more companies store their data electronically. Because of this, accounting information systems are often highly secured against viruses, hackers, and other external sources attempting to collect information.\n\nAn accounting information system (AIS) involves collecting, storing, and processing financial and accounting data used by internal users to report information to investors, creditors, and tax authorities.
