  "term": "Impaired Asset: Meaning, Causes, How to Test, and How to Record",
  "definition": "An impaired asset is a company asset that has declined in value and is no longer worth its original cost.\n\nAn impaired asset is machinery, equipment, real estate, patents, or any other company asset that has lost value.\n\nAssets must be reviewed regularly to determine their current value to ensure a company's financials accurately reflect its worth, and any adjustments must be properly recorded. Asset impairment is important for financial accuracy and decision-making, ensuring companies aren't reporting outdated figures.\n\nOverstating asset value can falsely represent a company'sfinancial health, leading to regulatory problems, loss of investor trust, and poor business strategies. Accurately reporting asset value ensures transparency, better planning, and adaptability.\n\nMost assets lose value over time, but not all decreases mean an asset is impaired. Asset impairment is associated with specific events, such asmarket downturns, advances in technology, or business inefficiencies.\n\nFor example, a machine that breaks down and needs repairs hasn't lost its value forever, it just needs to be fixed. On the other hand, a machine that becomes obsolete due to new technology would be considered impaired.\n\nAsset impairment happens to bothtangible assets(buildings/machinery) and intangible assets (patents/goodwill).\n\nTo determine if an asset is impaired, a company must compare itscarrying valueto its recoverable amount. The carrying value is the amount recorded on the financial statements, while the recoverable value is the greater of its market value or the cash flow the asset is expected to generate. If the carrying value is higher, then the asset is impaired, and this needs to be adjusted in the financial records.\n\nAccurate asset valuations are essential for financial health. They're also important to investors and other stakeholders who make decisions based on the expectation of correct financial data. If a company's worth is overstated, this could have drastic negative consequences for all parties involved.\n\nDifferent external or internal factors generally cause asset impairment. Here are a few of the most common reasons for asset impairment:\n\nTo ensure correct asset valuation, businesses should test for asset impairment regularly. Assessing underperformance or declines in market value are helpful indicators to determine if an asset is impaired.\n\nIf an asset may be impaired, a business will need to determine the asset's recoverable amount. This could be either itsfair value(the price it sells for) or its value in use (the present value of expected future cash flows generated from the asset).\n\nOnce the recoverable amount is known, compare it to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset is higher than the recoverable amount, the asset is impaired. If impaired, the value needs to be adjusted.\n\nThe new value is adjusted on the balance sheet, and the impairment loss needs to be recorded on the income statement, which reduces net income.\n\nFor example, Truck Drivers Inc. is a logistics company that has been in the truck delivery service for 50 years. The company has always had strong demand and provided excellent delivery services for its customers. It currently has a fleet of delivery trucks valued at $500,000.\n\nIn the last five years, however, Truck Drivers have seen their revenues significantly fall as they have lostmarket shareto newer delivery companies using tech-orientated delivery services. This has allowed these companies to provide more efficient delivery services at lower costs. Truck Drivers have just not been able tokeep upwith the new technology.\n\nDue to the new competition, the fleet's value has decreased to where the recoverable amount is $200,000; much lower than the carrying value of $500,000. As such, the company needs to record an asset impairment loss of $300,000.\n\nThe $300,000 impairment loss is recorded on the company's income statement, reducing net income for the period. Additionally, the $200,000 carrying value of the trucks is recorded on the balance sheet.\n\nBy accounting for the trucks' impairment, the company correctly represents its financial condition by not overstating asset value, which is important for regulators, analysts, and investors.\n\nThe two main accounting methods used globally aregenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), used primarily in the U.S., and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), mainly used in the rest of the world, such as Canada, Australia, the European Union, and South Korea.\n\nThe treatment of asset impairment is handled differently depending on which accounting method is used. Asset impairment under GAAP is a slightly more complicated process that uses two stages.\n\nFirst, impairment needs to be determined by comparing the asset's carrying value to its expected future cash flows. If the carrying value is higher than the cash flows, the asset is impaired. Next, the impairment loss needs to be calculated, which is the difference between the asset's carrying value and itsfair value.\n\nUnderIFRS, a business needs to determine the difference between an asset's carrying value and its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount can be either its fair value or its value in use. As with GAAP, if the carrying value is higher, the asset is impaired.\n\nImpairment may be confused withdepreciationas both represent the decline in an asset's value; however, there are important distinctions between the two.\n\nDepreciation is much more structured as it is an organized, gradual reduction of an asset's value over its useful life. This process happens every year to represent the natural wear and tear of an asset. A business is aware of this ahead of time and it is incorporated as part of business accounting.\n\nImpairment, on the other hand, is an unplanned drop in an asset's value due to unforeseen circumstances, either internal or external. This unexpected loss needs to be accounted for immediately and is not adjusted on an ongoing basis as depreciation is.\n\nRecognizing asset impairment is important for financial accuracy and business transparency. Unlike depreciation, which is a planned and gradual decline in value, asset impairment is an unexpected drop in an asset's value due to unexpected factors. By regularly assessing asset value, companies can avoid overstating their worth, which builds investor trust and complies with regulations.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. \"IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.\"\n\nHarvard Business School Online. \"GAAP vs. IFRS: What Are the Key Differences and Which Should You Use?\"\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards. \"Who Uses IFRS Accounting Standards?\"\n\nPwC. \"6.2 Impairment of Long-Lived Assets Held for Use\u2014General.\"",
