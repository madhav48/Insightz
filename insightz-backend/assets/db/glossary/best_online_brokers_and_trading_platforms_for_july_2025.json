Michael holds a bachelor's degree from West Virginia University and is a chartered member and subject matter expert (SME) for the industry-leading Chartered Market Technicians (CMT) Association.\n\nOur editors independently research and recommend the best products and services. You can learn more about ourindependent review processand partners in ouradvertiser disclosure. We may receive commissions on purchases made from our chosen links.\n\nThe best online brokerage platforms provide robust research and analytical tools, a wide range of assets to trade, strong customer support, numerous account types, and more\u2014all with a competitive and transparent fee structure and limited gamification tactics.\n\nAfter hundreds of hours of comprehensive research, data analysis, and live broker platform demos, Fidelity Investments is our best overall online brokerage platform for investors due to its low fees, expansive product offering, wide-ranging full-service features, and so much more. Fidelity is just one of 27 online brokers that we evaluated based on 92 weighted criteria, including available assets, account services, user experience, and additional features.\n\nWhen it comes to bringing critical full-service brokerage features, sophisticated tools, and low fees to a wide range of traders and investors, all across continually enhanced platforms, Fidelity reigns supreme for the fourth consecutive year.\n\nFidelity is our top broker for ETFs because of its richexchange-traded fund(ETF)-focused educational content and research tools, expansive ETF offering, and fractional ETF trading. Fidelity is a repeat winner in this category, having earned the top spot from Charles Schwab in 2023.\n\nFidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, and its transparent and compelling fee schedule is the reason why\u2014for the fourth year running\u2014it wins for low costs.\n\nFinding the best brokerage account for cash management is not just about earning the highest interest rate possible. It\u2019s also about seamless integration with essential, no-fee banking features and industry-leading insurance. In these areas, Fidelity\u2019s cash management offering is unmatched, and it comes with solid passive earnings power on uninvested cash, along with reimbursable access to a global network of ATMs.\n\nNo payment for order flow (PFOF) makes for excellent order execution\n\nStrong portfolio analysis and account features\n\nSuperior trading platforms for all types of investors\n\nTop-tier educational content, screening tools, and research capabilities\n\nFDIC insurance up to $5 million on uninvested cash\n\nOnly three digital coins available for trading\n\nMinimum balance required for some index trading\n\nMultiple platforms may be required to access all tools\n\nIn an industry full of innovative companies competing for the attention of an incredibly diverse universe of traders and investors, Fidelity delivers the most well-rounded product offering to suit the needs of nearly every investor. Headquartered in Boston, Fidelity\u2019s storied history began in 1946. As of March 31, 2025, the company had 39.2 million client accounts holding $5.9 trillion in discretionary assets, and ranked among the top brokerage firms in terms ofassets under management.\n\nInvestopedia began evaluating online brokerages in 2019, and Fidelity has shown a commitment to improving its financial products and services ever since. Improvements in financial advisor support, bond liquidity analysis, and the new Fidelity Youth app were the highlights of our 2024 product demonstration with the company. But the enhancements didn't stop there: Fidelity also revamped its process for opening core brokerage accounts, further streamlining the online experience for new users. The accounts now also have a comprehensive cash management product that is jam-packed with banking features.\n\nFidelity has long been an industry leader when it comes to lowering fees, but is also widely-regarded for its huge customer service network, which includes 216 customer centers, and provides excellent client support for its low-cost, high-value offering. Investors looking for an online broker that keeps trading costs low, all while delivering some of the most powerful tools in the industry and resisting the common industry practice of collectingPFOF, will be hard-pressed to find a better broker than Fidelity.\n\n\"I moved all of our family\u2019s investment accounts to Fidelity in 2021 for one simple, but valuable, reason: It\u2019s the only brokerage firm that offers every single account type we have, allowing me to house all of our investments under the same roof. We have a lot of different account types\u2014from various retirement and taxable accounts, to an inherited IRA, to529sand custodial accounts, and even an investableHSA. Before consolidating to Fidelity, I had to log into multiple places to check on our various investments. Now, except for a new workplace 401(k), I have one login that shows me everything on a single screen. And when I need customer support, Fidelity advisors can also view things as a whole. Moving to Fidelity has added a lot of ease and efficiency to my financial life.\" - Sabrina Karl, Staff Writer for Investopedia\n\nIn addition to our review of Fidelity's online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Fidelity Go.\n\nEven before TD Ameritrade\u2019s educational content was incorporated into its ecosystem, Charles Schwab\u2014which acquired TD Ameritrade in 2020\u2014was known as one of the best platforms for new traders and investors. With the integration now complete, Schwab has taken over top ranks in this category, a position TD Ameritrade used to dominate. Schwab now houses the most comprehensive library of evergreen learning materials, along with seemingly endless coaching programs and regularly scheduled live training events, making it the best for beginner investors.\n\nIndustry-leading educational content\n\nMultiple user-friendly platforms\n\nSuperb ETF research and scanners\n\nAccess to the highly regarded thinkorswim\u00ae platform\n\nLow interest earned on uninvested cash\n\nNo direct investments in cryptocurrencies\n\nChuck Schwab and his partners formed First Commander Corporation in April 1971, and later changed the company\u2019s name to Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. in 1973.Charles Schwab has since grown into a household name in the brokerage industry and, in October 2020 completed its acquisition of TD Ameritrade, with full client integration finalized by mid-2024.Not only does Schwab provide the right mix of usability, tools, education, and research to its diverse customer base, but it does so across multiple top-tier platforms. As of end of April 2025, Schwab\u2019s total client assets stood at $9.89 trillion.\n\nWith Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade complete, the combination of Schwab\u2019s exceptional lineup of products and services and TD Ameritrade\u2019s powerful trading capabilities has boosted the company even closer to the top of our comprehensive rating model. One of the most anticipated additions to Schwab's lineup occurred on April 11, 2024, with the company announcing thatfuturesand forex trading, along with a new Portfolio Margin feature, have been made available on its thinkorswim platform.Then, on Oct. 30, 2024, the company announced even more exciting news when it introduced overnight trading inS&P 500andNasdaq-100-traded stocks, as well as hundreds of additional exchange-traded funds (ETFs), 24 hours a day, five days a week (24/5).On Feb. 12, 2025, the company made overnight trading available to all clients via the thinkorswim platform.Prospective customers should note, however, that crypto spot trading still isn\u2019t available, but spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs are offered.\n\nIn addition to our review of Charles Schwab\u2019s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Schwab Intelligent Portfolios.\n\nInteractive Brokers\u2019 lineup of advanced analytical tools, trading technology, and breadth of assets is, quite frankly, awe-inspiring. Ongoing enhancements to legacy platforms like the masterfully constructed Trader Workstation (TWS) and the February 2024 addition of the next-generation IBKR desktop offer just a small glimpse into how Interactive Brokers equips advanced traders to capitalize on fundamental dislocations and pricing inefficiencies better than any other platform we reviewed. This is the fourth straight year Interactive Brokers has earned this award.\n\nSimply put, not one of the 27 online brokerage companies we reviewed comes close to offering the scope of global research capabilities, international trading and support access, and currency-based funding variety that Interactive Brokers offers. That's why, for the fourth straight year, the company is our top broker for international traders.\n\nAs trading technology continues to advance, so too does the interest inalgorithmic trading. Advanced traders will find a powerful lineup of algorithmic trading features in Interactive Brokers\u2019 pre-built algos, a laundry list of API languages, available algorithmic paper trading accounts, and so much more.\n\nWith its powerfulrebalancingfeatures, robust portfolio and risk analysis tools, nearly boundless opportunities for asset diversification, and available access to licensed brokers, investors will be hard-pressed to find a better platform for managing portfolio risk than Interactive Brokers.\n\nFor professional and retail traders looking for investing and trading ideas across the vast universe of equities, over short-, intermediate-, and long-term time horizons, Interactive Brokers brings together leading industry research vendors, proprietary search tools, and the industry\u2019s largest universe of investable stocks to provide a nearly endless source of ideas that suit every investing and trading strategy.\n\nAlready known as a platform with industry-leading trading technology and access to abundant account amenities for traders of all levels, on March 26, 2025, Interactive Brokers announced the addition of Solana, Cardano, Ripple, and Dogecoin, taking its existing crypto lineup to eight coins that can be traded with no spreads added to the relatively low commission of 0.12% to 0.18%.\n\nOn April 8, 2025 Interactive Brokers announced the addition of three new cryptocurrency tokens to its platform: Chainlink (LINK), Avalanche (AVAX), and Sui (SUI).Customers can access these new tokens on the same platform they use for trading stocks, options, futures, currencies, bonds, mutual funds, and more, across 160+ global markets.\n\nIncreasing availability of beginner-friendly platforms\n\nIndustry-best selection of contingent orders\n\nUnparalleled range of investable foreign and domestic assets\n\nPowerful and highly customizable professional-level functionality\n\nIBKR's SmartRouting not available to IBKR Lite clients\n\nFounded under the name T.P. & Co. in 1978 by its current chairman, Thomas Peterffy, the company pioneered the use of computers in trading. Eventually, Interactive Brokers Inc. was incorporated as a U.S. broker-dealer in 1993, and the company has since developed into one of the industry\u2019s most complete online brokerage platforms. Interactive Brokers (IBKR) offers astonishing access to 160 markets in 34 countries and support for its services in 200 countries and territories, all with funding and trading capabilities in up to 28 currencies.Simply put, this is by far the broadest global coverage in the industry. As of June 2025, IBKR held just over $628B in client assets.\n\nOne of the first adopters of technology to the financial markets, both algorithmic and active traders have long regarded the company highly for its advanced trading features, highly customizable tools, low margin rates, andalpha-generating capabilities. Investopedia's team of industry experts is constantly delighted by IBKR\u2019s innovative enhancements that just make so much sense from a purist\u2019s perspective. IBKR\u2019s latest product innovation is IBKR Desktop, a next-generation platform that combines a simple user interface with many of the company\u2019s powerful trading solutions. It features innovations like Option Lattice, a graphical options chain display highlighting potential outliers in key metrics, and MultiSort, which enables users to sort data using multiple factors simultaneously.Always looking for ways to use latest technology to give clients an advantage, the company also recently launched AI-powered news summaries.\n\nThis idea of simplicity is really where things have been getting interesting for Interactive Brokers, as the company has committed to making its platforms more accessible to beginners. With notable touches like the expansion of educational content across several platforms, including its entry-level IBKR Lite platform; availablefractional investing; and the innovative and helpful Options Wizard tool offered on its user-friendly Global Trader mobile app (as well as other platforms), Interactive Brokers is quickly gaining ground on the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms.\n\nIn addition to our review of Interactive Brokers' online brokerage platform, we've also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,Interactive Advisors.\n\nFor the fourth year in a row, we chose tastytrade as the best options trading platform because of its industry-leading options pricing structure, which includes pricing caps that make it the lowest-cost brokerage for high-volume, high-frequency option traders. In addition, tastytrade optimizes tools and content to specifically suit the needs of its options-focused client base.\n\nCapped commission structure for options\n\nHighly regarded tools for analyzing and monitoring options trades\n\nFantastic options-specific content and educational material\n\nFully customizable trading experience\n\nFollow Feed feature allows users to follow trades of tastylivecontributors\n\nNo on-platform paper trading support\n\nFew investing and retirement resources\n\nLacks some key investment choices like mutual funds\n\nAsk any options trader and they are likely to tell you that this form ofderivativetrading is complex and difficult to master. But with the right guidance, the many options strategies that are available to use can become powerful weapons that allow both traders and investors to benefit from key factors liketime decayand leverage. Created by the same people who developed TD Ameritrade\u2019s highly regarded thinkorswim platform, tastytrade maintains its stance as the best broker for options because of its intuitive delivery of an industry-best mix of comprehensive options-focused tools and content.\n\nLaunched as tastyworks in 2017 and headquartered in Chicago, tastytrade delivers very competitive transaction fees for options trading, including standout commission caps for large lot sizes, as well as the absence of any fees when closing positions. Fortunately for tastytrade users, these low commissions come with a platform that continues to undergo enhancements which complement its already powerful delivery of options analytics, platform workflow, trade execution, and valuable digital content. On Oct. 16, 2024, tastytrade even launched an options backtesting tool\u2013a highly advanced feature very few competitors boast.\n\nA pioneer in both mobile and online trading, E*TRADE has mastered the art of developing a mobile experience with the right mix of intuitive navigation, robust portfolio and risk management capabilities, deep research, easy-to-digest education, and complex trading tools to cater to investors and traders of all levels. Ongoing enhancements to E*TRADE's mobile capabilities over the past couple of years have solidified its position as our best mobile trading and investing platform for the first time ever.\n\nExcellent range of tools and resources\n\nPre-built and automated portfolio options\n\nTop mobile apps for traders and investors of all levels\n\nLacks international exchange trading\n\nFractional shares only available through a robo-advisor portfolio or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP)\n\nSince its founding in 1982, E*TRADE has been at the forefront of embracing innovation that makes for one of the best customer experiences in the industry. Following Morgan Stanley\u2019s acquisition of E*TRADE in 2020, the company has only continued to advance its capabilities by integrating many of Morgan Stanley\u2019s highly regarded research materials, thought leadership insights, and large pool of financial advisors.\n\nAs one of the largest online brokers in the country, E*TRADE brings an expansive list of investment choices and trading tools to clients via its website, desktop, and two mobile platforms.E*TRADE\u2019s already vast educational catalog has only grown with the Morgan Stanley integration, complementing the intuitive site design in a way that lets new investors enter the market with confidence. For more experienced investors, the ability to do deep analysis has never been greater than now, when proprietary Morgan Stanley research joins highly regarded third-party research and consensus ratings. While E*TRADE only offers these more advanced traders exposure tocryptocurrenciesvia Spot Bitcoin & Ethereum ETFs and related stocks, traders have access to a wide array of analysis tools, charting functionality, and trading technology to make the most informed decisions in this and many other asset classes.\n\nIn addition to our review of E*TRADE\u2019s online brokerage platform, we also reviewed the company's robo-advisor service,E*TRADE Core Portfolios.\n\nRobinhood is Investopedia's choice as the best traditional broker for trading cryptocurrency because of its industry-leading selection of available digital assets and sleek, user-friendly platform.\n\nSimple, intuitive trading experience\n\nBrokerage industry's largest selection of supported crypto assets\n\nLack of full transparency around crypto spread pricing\n\nNot all crypto assets are tradable through Robinhood Legend\n\nRobinhood, founded in 2013 and headquartered in Menlo Park, California, began as a simple, bare-bones mobile-focused platform determined to disrupting the brokerage industry with no-commission trading on stocks and ETFs. Since then, the company has gone on to introduce options and futures trading, has made solid cash management and IRA matching services available to its Robinhood Gold members, rolled out its more advanced Legend trading platform, and as recently as March 26, 2025, launched a wealth management product known as Robinhood Strategies, along with a number of additional products the company plans to roll out later this year.\n\nAlong the way, Robinhood has also introduced cryptocurrency trading to its customers, and has continued to build its list of tradable crypto ever since. U.S.-based crypto enthusiasts who appreciate Robinhood for its easy-to-use trading platforms will enjoy selecting from the company's list of 26 supported crypto assets, the brokerage industry's largest.For more advanced traders, however, Robinhood still lacks access to some of the critical research and sophisticated trading tools that some larger industry competitors offer. In addition, commission-free crypto trades still come with spread charges, and roughly half of the cryptocurrencies that Robinhood supports are not tradable through the new Legend platform.\n\nThrough our exhaustive research, we found that Fidelity not only outshines the competition when it comes to ETF investing, low costs, and cash management features, but it is also the best online brokerage platform overall. While International Brokers\u2019 ongoing evolution into a more beginner-friendly platform is driving it closer to parity with the industry\u2019s top all-around brokerage platforms, it remains a top choice for advanced trading techniques andrisk management, as well as international trading.\n\nFor traders planning to make options the main strategy they use to reach their investment goals, tastytrade\u2019s platform and market content are hard to beat. Charles Schwab\u2019s integration of TD Ameritrade's educational programs and trading personalities has produced an unparalleled body of actionable learning materials and live training content for beginners.\n\nE*TRADE\u2019s long history of enhancing the user experience continues to shine through with its fantastic mobile apps, while Robinhood makes crypto trading fun and easy for crypto enthusiasts.\n\nAccording toInvestopedia's latest Reader Survey, our readers revealed that they still own their favorite stocks, despite tariff and recession-related worries being among their top concerns.\n\nInvestopedia collected 89 criteria that are critical to investors, from 27 online brokerage companies. We used this data to review each brokerage platform for fees, usability, research amenities, and other key features to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to ensure our readers make the right decision for their investing needs. Investopedia launched in 1999, and has been helping readers find the best online brokerage accounts since 2019.\n\nInvestors choosing an online broker will find a wide range of options, each with varying product offerings, cost structures, and features. The best broker for you will ultimately depend on your individual goals, priorities, and preferences. Some investors may require advanced platforms with access to niche markets and exotic instruments, while others happily settle for a simple, user-friendly mobile app and cost-effective pricing. Whatever your objectives, here are some key factors to consider when choosing an online broker.\n\nThe commissions and fees your broker charges directly impact your bottom line, and can be a major factor to consider, especially for active traders. Nowadays, with rare exceptions, online brokers offer commission-free stock, ETF, and mutual funds trading, but still charge for options trades. In addition, brokers also generally charge for trading more advanced instruments, like futures, and more exotic asset classes, like cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe breadth of assets and instruments available to trade determines how flexible your investment portfolio or trading strategies can be. Most online brokers offer trading in stocks, ETFs, and options. A sizable number also provides access to futures and mutual funds. A small, but steadily growing group allows clients to trade cryptocurrencies.\n\nAdditionally, some brokers now offer fractional shares, which allow investors to buy a portion of high-priced stocks. This feature can be especially helpful for those with smaller accounts, as it makes expensive stocks more accessible. Access to a specific asset class can be a deciding factor when choosing an online broker.\n\nDifferent brokers cater to different trading styles. Whether you manage a long-term stock portfolio, trade complex options strategies, or activelyscalpintraday, make sure the platforms and features offered by your broker complement your style and facilitate your trades.\n\nA well-designed, intuitive platform can make trading easier and more enjoyable for traders of all levels, but especially for beginners. In recent years, many online brokers have invested significant time and money into making the user experience as seamless as possible.\u00a0Advanced platforms, although improving, may still come with a learning curve due to the amount of instruments and the complexity of tools on offer.\n\nResearch tools help investors make better trade decisions. Among others, this may include access to market data, analyst ratings, charting tools, and latest financial reports. Brokers with robust research capabilities may provide traders an edge by offering quicker access to essential market data.\n\nFor beginners and experienced investors alike, educational resources are a way to continue improving their knowledge and strategies. A broker offering tutorials, webinars, and in-depth guides can help users stay informed and grow their trading expertise.\n\nOther considerations may include account minimums and benefits, supported order types, customer support accessibility, and premium account offerings.\u00a0Brokers with zero account minimums are more accessible to new investors, while traders with large account balances may benefit from earning interest on unused cash.\n\nActive traders will value a broker\u2019s support of complex order types, and those who trade international markets or cryptocurrencies will appreciate the ability to get customer support 24/7. More recently, some brokers also began offering premium accounts - providing additional services or offering better pricing, usually in exchange for a monthly fee. Such accounts may be beneficial to certain investors.\n\n\"When you're thinking about opening a brokerage or investment account, it\u2019s good to start by considering your goals and how hands-on you want to be,\" saidTaylor Kovar, CFP, MBA, a member ofInvestopedia\u2019s Financial Advisor Council. \"Are you looking to invest for something long-term, like retirement or a big purchase, or are you focusing on shorter-term goals? And don\u2019t feel like you have to go all in right away\u2014you can always start small and gradually increase your contributions as you get more comfortable.\"\n\nThis report identifies the best online brokers and trading platforms. It is natural to ask, \u201cHow do these brokers and platforms differ from full-service brokers?\u201d One key difference is that online brokers cater todo-it-yourself (DIY) investors. In contrast, full-service brokers aim to relieve you of as much heavy financial lifting as possible by shifting it to their own advisors or affiliated experts.\n\nWhile online brokers harp on their low costs\u2013not just for trades but also low minimums to open accounts and low costs for access to research, tools, and services\u2013full-service brokers boast of the wide range of their offerings. Those include everything from personal financial planning to insurance, estate planning, retirement planning, accounting services, tax advice, and more.\n\nStill, the boundary between the two categories of brokers is more and more blurry. Online brokers increasingly offer more services, whilefull-service brokersincreasingly cut costs. In fact, many investors would be hard pressed to explain why some online brokers\u2013especially the larger ones\u2013should not be thought of as full-service firms.\n\nCertified financial planner Michael Donnelly, who is account director of corporate relations at the CFP Board of Standards, said, \u201cThe financial services landscape has dramatically changed over the past 30 years. Firms that once served specific clients now compete to keep pace with broader client needs and lower-cost competitors. [Full]-service and online brokers have had to expand their offerings and cut costs to stay competitive. As a result, investors benefit from more similar and competitively priced products across the financial planning ecosystem.\u201d\n\nThe online brokerage industry is a highly competitive space consisting of a wide range of companies, each offering it's own set of features that will appeal differently to individuals. After two months of comprehensive research, Investopedia found that Fidelity offers the best overall online brokerage services and trading platform. Not only did Fidelity earned the highest overall score when measured by our proprietary scoring model it also scored highly for its low costs, excellent ETF selection and research, and for its robust cash management product.\n\nA brokerage account is a type of account similar in function to the accounts you have with a bank. With a brokerage account, you deposit funds with an investment firm (the brokerage). This is usually done by a transfer from your existing bank account. Once funds are added to your brokerage account, you can put the money to work using the brokerage's trading platform to invest those funds in the market. The assets you buy with your cash can be anything offered by that brokerage, including stocks, bonds, ETFs, and even cryptocurrency.\n\nYour online brokerage account will display your holdings (the assets you've purchased) as well as your cash balance (your buying power). If you invest in something that gains in value, you can sell it and the profits will be deposited in your online brokerage account. From there, you can place another trade or even transfer the funds out to your regular bank account to use elsewhere. Some brokerage accounts even allow you to earn interest on your uninvested cash.\n\nThere is no longer a real minimum to start investing in the financial markets. With many brokers offering margin accounts with access to fractional shares and no required minimums, you can open and fund an account with any amount of money. If you don't have a lot of money to invest, however, it will influence how you approach the market. Although you could invest $1 infractional sharesof a specific stock, the better approach with limited capital is to use ETFs.Index tracking ETFs, for example, offer greater diversification for your dollar than a single company stock because every share (and fractional share) of the ETF replicates an index made up of many companies in many different industries. You could also consider using options to leverage your dollars with a directional bet on the market or a specific stock, but this is an investment strategy best reserved forrisk capital\u2014not the whole of your limited investment capital.\n\nWhen investing with small sums, consistency is the key to building wealth. If you can regularly put a set amount of money into the market\u2014even $10 a week\u2014you will be surprised at how quickly it begins to grow. This consistency also helps to smooth market effects, as you will be buying dips and peaks as the market goes up and down.\n\nMany online brokers allow for small minimum deposits which can be a great alternative for those with limited funds. Account minimums (if any) are displayed at the top of our reviews, as well as in our selection of the best platforms for different types of investors. If you are looking for more general guidance on investing with limited capital, check out our article onsmart investing on a small budget.\n\nSome online brokers have powerful mobile apps delivering nearly all the features that their desktop counterparts do. For example, E*TRADE's app, which we picked as our best app for mobile investing and trading, offers two mobile platforms that are streamlined versions of the company's powerful desktop platform.\n\nYes, you can. It is a reality of the market thatno reward comes without risk. You can lose money buying a bad investment, but you can also lose by buying a good investment at the wrong time. Investment decisions should be guided by extensive research and careful consideration of your risk tolerance. When it comes to the financial markets, there are endless possibilities for making and losing money. Unless all the funds in your brokerage account are sitting in uninvested cash (brokerage cash accounts are afforded up to $250,000 of protection bySecurities Investor Protection Corporationinsurance), there is a risk you will lose money.\n\nAnother way of looking at that, however, is that a brokerage account sitting full of uninvested cash isn't at risk of making any money either. You can use strategies like asset allocation and diversification to reduce the risk of you losing money, but you will never fully eliminate it without also eliminating your chances of making a decent return.\n\nYes, you can actually buy and sell stocks without a broker, but it is not a common approach these days. Some companies still offerdirect stock purchase plansthat allow you to buy shares directly from the company. Companies administer these plans according to internal rules, and some are only open to company employees. You need to contact companies to find out whether they offer a direct stock purchase plan and what the terms and conditions are. These plans initially helped investors avoid brokerage fees, but the rise of online discount brokers with zero fees has removed this barrier, making the direct stock purchase plan somewhat of a relic.\n\nAn important thing to consider is the distinction betweeninvesting and trading. When people talk about investing they generally mean buying assets to hold long-term. The goal of investing is to gradually build wealth and reach your retirement goals. Conversely, trading involves short-term strategies that maximize returns on a short-term basis, such as daily or monthly. Trading is generally considered riskier than investing.\n\nAll these factors are worth considering before choosing an online broker. Do you want to trade or invest? Do you want a great mobile app to check your portfolio wherever you are? What types of assets are you looking to invest in? Answering these questions is not always easy. For more support on how to choose a broker, you can check out ourguide to choosing a stock broker. Once you've made a decision on a broker, you can refer to ourguide to opening a brokerage account.\n\nAccording toInvestopedia\u2019s latest Reader Survey, readers still choose individual stocks as their top choice for where they would invest if they had an extra $10,000 on hand, even though their appetite for risk has faded since February. This is followed by ETFs, money market funds, and CDs.\n\nWe researched and reviewed 27 online brokers and trading platforms to find the best companies you see in the list above.

We combined our industry research and subject matter expertise to guide the research and weightings for our 2025 online broker rankings. To collect the data, our researchers collected data points through online research of provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual brokerages. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from Dec. 20, 2024 to Feb 19, 2025.\n\nWe then developed a proprietary model that scored each company to rate its performance across 11 major categories and 120 criteria to find the best online brokers and trading platforms.
