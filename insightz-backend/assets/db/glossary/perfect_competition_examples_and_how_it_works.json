  "definition": "Learn all about this theoretical market structure\n\nPerfect competition, also known as pure competition, is an idealized market condition in which many sellers compete to offer the best prices, and large sellers have no advantages over smaller ones. Perfect competition rarely occurs in real-world markets, but it provides a useful framework for understanding how supply and demand influence prices and behavior in a market economy.\n\nThere are many buyers and sellers in a perfectly competitive market, and prices are determined purely by supply and demand. Companies earn just enough profit to stay in business and no more. Other companies would enter the market and drive profits down if they were to earn excess profits.\n\nPerfect competition is a benchmark or ideal type to which real-life market structures can be compared.\u00a0Pure competition istheoretically the oppositeof a monopoly, in which only a single firm supplies a good or service. That firm can charge whatever price it wants because\u00a0consumers have no alternatives, and it's difficult for would-be competitors to enter the marketplace.\n\nThere are no monopolies in a perfect competition model. This kind of structure has several key characteristics:\n\nThis can be contrasted with the more realistic imperfect competition that exists whenever a hypothetical or real market violates the abstract tenets of neoclassical pure or perfect competition.\n\nAll real markets exist outside the plane of the perfect competition model, so each can be classified as imperfect. The contemporary theory of imperfect versus perfect competition stems from the Cambridge tradition of post-classical economic thought.\n\nA perfectly competitive market is defined by several factors.\n\nA large number of buyers and sellers exist in a perfectly competitive market. The sellers are small firms rather than largecorporationsthat are capable of controlling prices through supply adjustments. They sell products with minimal differences in capabilities, features, and pricing. This ensures that buyers can't distinguish between products based on physical attributes, such as size or color, or intangible values, such as branding.\n\nA large population of both buyers and sellers ensures that supply and demand remain constant in this market. Buyers can easily substitute products made by one firm for others.\n\nInformation about an industry's ecosystem and competition constitutes a significant advantage. Knowledge about component sourcing and supplier pricing can make or break the market for certain companies.\n\nInformation about patents and competitors' research initiatives can help companies develop competitive strategies and build a moat around their products in certain knowledge and research-intensive industries such as pharmaceuticals and technology.\n\nThe availability of free and perfect information in a perfectly competitive market ensures that each firm can produce its goods or services at the same rate and with the same production techniques as another in the market.\n\nGovernments play a vital role in market formation for products by imposing regulations and price controls. They can control the entry and exit of firms into a market by setting up rules to function in it. The pharmaceutical industry must contend with a roster of rules governing the development, production, and sale of drugs.\n\nThese rules require significantcapital investmentsin the form of employees, such as lawyers and quality assurance personnel, as well as infrastructure, such as machinery to manufacture medicines. The cumulative costs add up and make it extremely expensive for companies to bring a drug to the market.\n\nThe technology industry functions with relatively less oversight as compared to its pharma counterpart. Entrepreneurs in this industry can start firms with less capital, making it easy for individuals to start a company in the industry.\n\nSuch controls don't exist in a perfectly competitive market. The entry and exit of firms are unregulated, and this frees them up to spend on labor and capital assets without restrictions and adjust their output in relation to market demands.\n\nCheap and efficient transportation is another characteristic of perfect competition. Companies don't incur significant costs to transport goods in this type of market. This helps reduce the product's price and cuts back on delays in transporting goods.\n\nReal-world competition differs from this ideal primarily due todifferentiation in production, marketing, and sales. The owner of a small organic products shop can advertise extensively about the grain fed to the cows that made the manure that fertilized the non-GMO soybeans, thereby setting their product apart from competitors. This is referred to as differentiation.\n\nHomogeneous products and price takers are far from realistic, but the global tech and trade transformation is improving information and resource flexibility. The reality is far from this theoretical model, but the model is still helpful because of its ability to explain many real-life behaviors.\n\nCompanies seek to establish brand value through marketing\u00a0around their differentiation. They advertise to gain pricing power and market share.\n\nMany industries also have significantbarriers to entry, such as high\u00a0startup costs, as seen in the auto manufacturing industry, or strict\u00a0government regulations,\u00a0as seen in the utility industry. These limit the ability of firms to enter and exit such industries. Consumer awareness has increased with the information age, but there are still very few industries where the buyer remains aware of all available products and prices.\n\nSignificant obstacles exist that prevent perfect competition from developing in the economy. The agricultural industry probably comes closest to exhibiting perfect competition because it's characterized by many small producers with virtually no ability to alter the selling price of their products.\n\nThe commercial buyers of agricultural commodities are generally very well-informed, and it's not particularly difficult to enter the marketplace as a producer, although agricultural production does involve some barriers to entry.\n\nPerfect competition is an idealized framework for a market economy. It provides a convenient model for how an economy works, but it's not always accurate and has significant departures from the real-world economy. The value of a perfect competition framework is only accurate to the extent that it reflects actual conditions.\n\nOne notable feature of perfect competition is low profit margins. All consumers have access to the same products, so they naturally gravitate toward the lowest prices. Firms can't set themselves apart by charging a premium for higher-quality products and services. It would be impossible for a company like Apple (AAPL) to exist in a perfectly competitive market because its phones are more expensive than those of its competitors.\n\nAnother issue is the absence of innovation. The prospect of greater market share and setting themselves apart from the competition is an incentive for firms to innovate and make better products. No firm possesses a dominantmarket sharein perfect competition, however. The long-term profitability of their operations is zero.\n\nThe absence of economies of scale in a perfectly competitive market is a disadvantage. Being limited to zero profit margins means that companies will have less cash to invest in expanding their production capabilities. An expansion of production capabilities could potentially bring down costs for consumers and increase business profit margins. The presence of several small firms cannibalizing the market for the same product prevents this, however, and ensures that the average firm size remains small.\n\nProvides a convenient framework for modeling market activity.\n\nDemonstrates how producers are incentivized to provide lower prices.\n\nThe perfect competition model does not always reflect real-world market conditions.\n\nThe model does not account for geographical differences or variations between products.\n\nThe model does not account for how producers benefit from economies of scale.\n\nProfits may be possible for brief periods in perfectly competitive markets, but the market's dynamics cancel out the effects of positive or negative profits and bring them toward an equilibrium. There's no information asymmetry in the market, so other firms will quickly ramp up their production or reduce their manufacturing costs to achieve parity with the firm that made profits.\n\nTheaverage revenueand marginal revenue for firms in a perfectly competitive market are equal to the product's price to the buyer. The perfectly competitive market's equilibrium that had been disrupted earlier will be restored as a result. An adjustment of supply and demand ensures all profits or losses in such markets tend toward zero in the long run.\n\nThe opposite of perfect competition is a monopoly in which a single company controls the supply of a certain product. Consumers can't go elsewhere if the price is too high in monopolistic conditions. They can only decide not to buy the product.\n\nThe monopolistic firm can simply set a price point that maximizes its profits, rather than setting prices based on supply and demand. Some types of firms are considerednatural monopoliesbecause there's a significant first-mover advantage that discourages competitors from entering the market. Other monopolies may be established through government actions or by cartels such as OPEC.\n\nPerfect competition is a theoretical construct and doesn't actually exist. As such, it is difficult to find real-life examples of perfect competition but there are variants present in everyday society.\n\nConsider the situation at a farmer\u2019s market, a place that's characterized by a large number of small sellers and buyers. There's typically little difference between products and their prices from one farmer\u2019s market to another. How the produce is grown doesn't matter unless the market is classified as organic. There's very little difference in how they're packaged or branded. It won't make a difference to the average prices even if one of the farms goes out of business,\n\nThe situation may be relatively similar in the case of two competing supermarkets that stock their aisles from the same set of companies. Again, there's little to distinguish products from one another between both supermarkets and their pricing remains almost the same.\n\nAnother example of perfect competition is the market for unbranded products which features cheaper versions of well-known products.\n\nProduct knockoffs are generally priced similarly and there's little to set them apart from each other. One product is simply replaced by another if one of the firms manufacturing it goes out of business.\n\nThe development of markets in the technology industry also resembles perfect competition to a certain degree. A proliferation of sites offered similar services during the early days of social media networks. Some examples of such sites are Sixdegrees.com, Blackplanet.com, and Asianave.com. None of them had a dominant market share and the sites were mostly free. They constituted sellers in the market. Consumers of such sites, mainly young people, were the buyers.\n\nThestartupcosts for companies in this space were minimal. Startups and companies can freely enter and exit these markets. Technologies such as PHP and Java were largely open-source and available to anyone. Capital costs in the form of real estate and infrastructure weren't necessary. For example, Mark Zuckerberg effectively founded Facebook (now Meta) from his college dorm.\n\nPerfect competition occurs when all companies sell identical products, market share doesn't influence price, companies can enter or exit without barriers, buyers have perfect or full information, and companies can't determine prices. It's a market that's entirely influenced by market forces. It's the opposite of imperfect competition, which is a more accurate reflection of current market structures.\n\nConsider a farmers market where each vendor sells the same type of jam. There's little difference between each of their products because they use the same recipe, and they each sell them at an equal price. Sellers are few and free to participate in the market without any barriers. Buyers would be fully knowledgeable of the product's recipe in this case, as well as any other information relevant to the product.\n\nPerfect competition is an idealized market structure in which equal and identical products are sold. Imperfect competition can be found in monopolies and real-life examples. It involves companies competing for market share, high barriers of entry, and buyers lacking complete information on a product or service. This creates an incentive to innovate and produce better products as well as increased profit margins due to the influence of supply and demand.\n\nPerfect competition describes an imaginary market condition in which all consumers have access to the same products and information. All firms must offer the lowest price possible in this type of economy, or risk being undercut by their competitors. This is only a theoretical model, but perfect competition is useful for demonstrating how economic actors behave in a free market.\n\nHarvard Business School. \"(Im)Perfect Competition: Unrealistic Economics or Useful Strategy Tool?\"\n\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration. \"Facts About the Current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMPs).\"\n\nSchlander, Michael, et al. \"How Much Does It Cost to Research and Develop a New Drug?
