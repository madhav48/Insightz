These costs may be spent for the general maintenance of items like running anti-virus software on computer systems or they may be used for repairs such as fixing a car or machinery. These expenses are in addition to the actualpurchase priceof an asset, so individuals and companies should be able and willing to foot the bill in order to keep their assets in running order.\n\nConsumers who purchase assets should expect to pay maintenance expenses at some point in the future if they want to use them over a period of time. As mentioned earlier, these costs are incurred in order to keep an individual or company's assets in good working order.\n\nHow much an individual pays in maintenance expenses depends on the type of asset and how often upkeep is required and performed. Individuals may incur maintenance costs for homes, automobiles, appliances, and electronics, while businesses pay for maintenance on theirfixed assets\u2014vehicles, equipment, facilities\u2014and their technology.\n\nKeeping up to date with regular maintenance can keep costs down because the asset is serviced on a timely basis. Neglecting assets and waiting until the last minute to service them may result in higher maintenance costs. If the asset isn't maintained at all, the owner may have to replace it altogether.\n\nConsumers should consider the initial price tag as well as the item's ongoing maintenanceexpenseswhen they purchase an item that requires upkeep. This is why it's always a good idea for any consumer toset some money asidefor maintenance expenses. Failure to do so may result in financial distress when it comes time to pay for these charges in the future.\n\nIt's always a good idea to have money set aside for the regular maintenance of your assets.\n\nAs mentioned above, maintenance expenses depend on the type of asset held.

Cleaning or replacement of any carpeting, as well as painting, is also paid for by the landlord.\n\nGovernment regulations require landlords to maintain certain safety andliving standards.

Therental agreementshould define what expenses are the renter's responsibility.\n\nMonthly fees are common for people who own condominiums.Condo feescan range from $50 to $1,000 depending on the property, building, and location. If the building has a concierge, swimming pool, tennis courts, or gym, those costs are built into the monthly condo fee.\n\nBuyers who want maintenance-free living should consider the monthly fees when calculating their affordability and the potential mortgage payment for the condominium. If, for example, the mortgage payment is $1,500 per month while the condo fee is $600 per month, the condo fee represents nearly 30% of the total monthly payments to live there.\n\nOwning a vehiclerequires regular maintenance\u2014oil changes, tire rotation, and engine flushes.
