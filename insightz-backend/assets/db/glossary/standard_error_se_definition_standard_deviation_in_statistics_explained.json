  "term": "Standard Error (SE) Definition: Standard Deviation in Statistics Explained",
  "definition": "Standard error is a measurement of the variability of a data set and how accurately it represents the population being evaluated.\n\nStandard error (SE) is a statistic that reveals how accurately sample data represents the whole population. It measures the accuracy with which asample distributionrepresents a population. In statistics, a sample mean deviates from the actual mean of a population; this deviation is the standard error of the mean.\n\nThe standard error is considered part of inferential statistics\u2014or, the conclusions drawn from the study. It is inversely proportional to the sample size; the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error because the statistic will approach the actual value.\n\nThe term \"standard error,\" or SE for short, is used to refer to thestandard deviationof various sample statistics, such as themeanor median.\n\nWhen a population is sampled, the mean, or average, is generally calculated. The standard error describes the variation between the calculated mean of the population and one which is considered known, or accepted as accurate. This helps compensate for any incidental inaccuracies related to the gathering of the sample.\n\nThe \"standard error of the mean\" refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of sample means taken from a population. The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size.\n\nThe deviation of the standard error is expressed as a number. Sometimes, the deviation is necessary or desired to be shown as a percentage. When shown as a percentage it is known as therelative standard error.\n\nStandard error and standard deviation are measures of variability, while central tendency measures include mean, median, etc.\n\nThe smaller the standard error, the more representative the sample will be of the overall population. And the more data points involved in the calculations of the mean, the smaller the standard error tends to be. In cases where the standard error is large, the data may have some notable irregularities.\n\nIn cases where multiple samples are collected, the mean of each sample may vary slightly from the others, creating a spread among the variables. This spread is most often measured as the standard error, accounting for the differences between the means across the datasets.\n\nUsed in algorithmic trading, the standard error of an estimate can be calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:\n\nSE=\u03c3\u221anwhere:\u03c3=The\u00a0population\u00a0standard\u00a0deviation\u221an=The\u00a0square\u00a0root\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0sample\u00a0size\\begin{aligned}&\\text{SE} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\surd n}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\sigma=\\text{The population standard deviation}\\\\&\\surd n = \\text{The square root of the sample size}\\end{aligned}\u200bSE=\u221an\u03c3\u200bwhere:\u03c3=The\u00a0population\u00a0standard\u00a0deviation\u221an=The\u00a0square\u00a0root\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0sample\u00a0size\u200b\n\nIf the population standard deviation is not known, you can substitute the sample standard deviation,s, in the numerator to approximate the standard error.\n\nThe standard deviation is a representation of the spread of each of the data points. It is used to help determine the validity of the data based on the number of data points displayed at each level of standard deviation.\n\nStandard errors function more as a way to determine the accuracy of the sample or the accuracy of multiple samples by analyzing deviation within the means.\n\nThe standard error normalizes the standard deviation relative to the sample size used in an analysis. Standard deviation measures the amount of variance or dispersion of the data spread around the mean. The standard error can be thought of as the dispersion of the sample mean estimations around the true population mean.\n\nWhen statisticians or researchers estimate a population parameter, they rarely know the exact value. Instead, they use sample data to make an educated guess. As discussed above, this is the confidence interval. This range gives a sense of how much uncertainty surrounds the estimate.\n\nUnderstanding the role of standard error in confidence intervals can help interpret study results. For example, if two studies estimate the same population mean but have very different confidence intervals, it's often because of differences in standard error. A narrow interval implies greater confidence in the estimate\u2019s precision, while a wider one suggests the need for more data or better sampling methods. In practical terms, confidence intervals\u2014powered by standard error\u2014help researchers and decision-makers gauge the reliability of the numbers they rely on.\n\nStandard error also impactshypothesis testing, especially when comparing sample statistics to population parameters. In tests like the z-test ort-test, you use the standard error to measure how far the sample result is from what we would expect if the null hypothesis were true. It helps determine whether the observed effect is likely due to chance or if it's statistically significant. Without standard error, we wouldn't have a way to judge the reliability of the sample estimate.\n\nIn both z-tests and t-tests, the test statistic is calculated by comparing the sample statistic, the hypothesized value, and the standard error. This ratio tells us how many standard errors the sample statistic is away from the value assumed under the null hypothesis. A large test statistic suggests the sample result is far from the expected value, which could indicate that the null hypothesis should be rejected. If the result is close\u2014within about two standard errors, for example\u2014it\u2019s likely not significant.\n\nThis test statistic is then used to find a p-value, which tells us the probability of observing a result as extreme as the one in the sample, assuming the null hypothesis is true. The smaller the standard error, the larger the test statistic will be. That\u2019s why standard error directly affects whether a result is statistically significant.\n\nYou can also conceptualize this by thinking of a bell curve where the center represents the null hypothesis. If the standard error is large, the curve is wider and flatter, meaning observed results must be farther from the center to be considered unusual. If the standard error is small, the curve is tighter, and even small differences from the center appear extreme.\n\nOne of the biggest downsides to using standard error is that standard error assumes a random and representative sample. If the sample is biased or poorly collected, the calculated standard error may underestimate or misrepresent the true uncertainty. This can lead to misleading confidence intervals or inaccurate hypothesis tests.\n\nAnother limitation is that the standard error becomes less reliable with small sample sizes. In small samples, the estimate of variability may not reflect the true population variance, which affects the accuracy of the standard error. This is why t-tests, which adjust for small sample sizes using the t-distribution, are often preferred over z-tests when dealing with limited data.\n\nStandard error also assumes that the data being analyzed follows a certain distribution, typically a normal distribution. If the underlying data is highlyskewed, contains outliers, or doesn't meet the assumptions of the central limit theorem, then the standard error might not accurately show the true variability of the estimate.\n\nSay that an analyst has looked at a random sample of 50 companies in the S&P 500 to understand the association between a stock's P/E ratio and subsequent 12-month performance in the market.\n\nAssume that the resulting estimate is -0.20, indicating that for every 1.0 point in theP/E ratio, stocks return 0.2% poorer relative performance. In the sample of 50, the standard deviation was found to be 1.0.\n\nTherefore, we would report the estimate as -0.20% \u00b1 0.14, giving us a confidence interval of (-0.34 - -0.06).The true mean value of the association of the P/E on returns of the S&P 500 would therefore fall within that range with a high degree of probability.\n\nSay now that we increase the sample of stocks to 100 and find that the estimate changes slightly from -0.20 to -0.25, and the standard deviation falls to 0.90. The new standard error would thus be:\n\nSE=0.90\u221a100=0.9010=0.09.\\begin{aligned}&\\text{SE} = \\frac{0.90}{\\surd100} = \\frac{0.90}{10} = 0.09.\\end{aligned}\u200bSE=\u221a1000.90\u200b=100.90\u200b=0.09.\u200b\n\nThe resulting confidence interval becomes -0.25 \u00b1 0.09 = (-0.34 - -0.16), which is a tighter range of values.\n\nGenerally, if you're analyzing data, you'll need to be aware of the standard error because it can tell you how much variation is in the sampled data. Regarding investing and trading, it can be used to evaluate how likely and how much an asset's future returns are to fluctuate and the reliability of historical averages.\n\nFor instance, if your analysis results in a standard error of -0.25 \u00b1 0.09 = (-0.34 - -0.16), you can make an educated guess that your investment's future returns should fall within this range (as long as market conditions remain the same).\n\nStandard error is intuitively the standard deviation of the sampling distribution. In other words, it depicts how much disparity there is likely to be in a point estimate obtained from a sample relative to the true population mean.\n\nStandard error measures the amount of discrepancy that can be expected in a sample estimate compared to the true value in the population. Therefore, the smaller the standard error the better. In fact, a standard error of zero (or close to it) would indicate that the estimated value is exactly the true value.\n\nThe standard error takes the standard deviation and divides it by the square root of the sample size. Many statistical software packages automatically compute standard errors.\n\nThe standard error (SE) measures the dispersion of estimated values obtained from a sample around the true value to be found in the population.\n\nStatistical analysis and inference often involve drawing samples and running statistical tests to determine associations and correlations between variables. The standard error thus tells us with what degree of confidence we can expect the estimated value to approximate the population value.",
