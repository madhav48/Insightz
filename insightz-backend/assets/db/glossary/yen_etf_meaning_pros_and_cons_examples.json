  "term": "Yen ETF: Meaning, Pros and Cons, Examples",
  "definition": "The term yen ETF refers to anexchange-traded fund (ETF)that tracks the relative value of theJapanese yen (JPY)in the foreign exchange (forex) market. This is done against a single currency or against a basket of other currencies.\n\nYen ETFs invest primarily in yen-backed assets, including short-term debt instruments and bonds, or simply hold the spot currency in interest-bearing accounts. Investing in a yen ETF gives investors exposure and access to the yen without the need for forex accounts.\n\nBuying and selling foreign currencies was traditionally a complicated process that involved opening up a foreign exchange account. It was a privilege generally reserved for experienced traders with expert knowledge. But ETFs helped change that, making the forex market more accessible to the average investor.\n\nCurrency ETFsare pre-packaged investments tasked with tracking specific currencies in the same way that regular ETFs seek to replicate the performance of an index. Like stocks, these vehicles trade on astock exchangeand their prices fluctuate throughout the day as traders buy and sell them.\n\nYen ETFs track the performance of Japan's currency relative to a single currency (like the U.S. dollar or euro) or against a basket of currencies. Like other currency ETFs, these investments give investors easy and affordable access to trade currencies during the trading day. They also allow investors to diversify their portfolios and can be used to benefit fromarbitrageopportunities or to hedge against major economic events.\n\nThe portfolios of yen ETFs usually include yen-denominatedfutures contracts,debt securities, money market funds, and cash deposits. These funds generate income for investors through the performance of the yen against other currencies as well as through interest generated by some securities in the portfolio.\u00a0Some yen ETFs match the currentincomeearned on the yen assets with adividend yield. Others use that income to pay the expenses of managing the ETF.\n\nThere are three JPY ETFs that trade in the United States as per VettaFi (formerly ETF Database).\n\nInvestors who hold yen ETFs (or any other currency ETF for that matter) should keep tabs on all major economic data that affect their investments. This includes the release ofgross domestic product (GDP),\u00a0retail sales, industrial production, inflation,trade balances,\u00a0employment figures, interest rates, including scheduled meetings of the central bank, and the daily news flow when investing in currencies.\n\nInterest rates, inflation, and the country's equity market performance should also be taken into account when evaluating the relative attractiveness of a foreign currency.When it comes to Japan and yen traders, very lowinflationand low interest rates make the currency historically attractive as acarry trade.These low interest rates make it relatively cheap to borrow in yen to fund risk-taking in other currencies that carry higher interest rates.\n\nTheTankan\u00a0surveyis also something that investors may want to consider. Tankan, which is an economic survey of Japanese businesses, is published by theBank of Japan (BOJ)every quarter. It is used\u00a0to formulatemonetary policyand, as a result, often moves trading in Japanese stock and currency.\n\nMost of the movement in currency markets is dictated by interest rates, inflation, a country's economic conditions, and its political stability.\n\nThere are several obvious benefits and drawbacks to investing in yen ETFs\u2014some of which also apply to other currency ETFs as well.\n\nInvesting in foreign currencies enables investors to protect themselves in case their own currency declines in value.\u00a0Over the years, many have opted for the yen, which is the third-most widely traded currency globally behind the U.S. dollar and theeuro.It is also the most widely traded currency in Asia.\n\nThe yen is sometimes used to provide diversification, as it frequently trades inversely to other major currencies in relation to the U.S. dollar. The currency is often used as areserve currencyin international transactions and has even developed a reputation as asafe haven.\n\nAnother factor to consider is that Japan is the world\u2019s largestcreditor.There\u2019s also a popular belief among traders that investors there tend to dump foreign holdings and bring their money back home in times of hardship, bolstering demand for the yen and, subsequently, its valuation.\n\nSome investors consider currency ETFs risky. That's becausemacroeconomicevents affect currency values around the world, even in stable nations such as Japan. Unpredictable natural disasters can also have a big impact, an example being the Fukushima disaster in 2011, which caused a surge in the value of the yen, followed by arecession.\n\nA handful of analysts have questioned the Japanese yen\u2019s safe-haven status, pointing to the following issues:\n\nThe yen has also lost some of its luster as a popular carry trade as low-interest rates become commonplace among major economies.\n\nThese observations serve as a reminder that forex\u00a0trading is not a market for the unprepared. Traders must be knowledgeable about major foreign\u00a0currencies and stay abreast of not only the current economic stats for a country but also the underpinnings of the respective economies and the special factors that can influence the currencies, such ascommoditymovement or interest rate changes.\n\nProtects against declines in the home currency\n\nJapan is world's largest creditor\n\nYen is susceptible to macroeconomic risks\n\nLost luster as popular carry trade\n\nThe most popular yen ETF is the Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) with$279.2 million inassets under management (AUM)as of December 2023. FXY was launched in February 2007 and seeks to mirror the price and performance of the yen relative to the USD. It does this by holding yen on deposit. The fund has anexpense ratioof 0.40%.\n\nInvestors looking to add yen ETFs to theirportfolioshave a couple of other options, too. Alternatives include the ProShares Ultra Yen ETF (YCL) and ProShares UltraShort Yen ETF (YCS). One thing to note, though, is that these two areleveraged ETFs, with the latter being aninverse ETF.\n\nAs an ordinary investor, Japanese Yen ETFs are the easiest way to gain access to the yen.\n\nThe Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust (FXY) is the most common yen ETF which holds physical yen in its account.ProShares also offers two yen ETFs\u2014the ProShares Ultra Yen ETF (YCL) and ProShares UltraShort Yen ETF (YCS). These two options, though, are levered. YCL provides 2x long exposure and the YCS provides 2x inverse exposure to the yen.\n\nAmerican investors caninvest in the Nikkei 225 index, Japan's primary equity index, via an ETF. These include:\n\nA yen ETF invests in bonds and other instruments that reflect the value of the Japanese currency in the foreign exchange markets. In the past, low inflation rates have made the yen attractive to some currency traders, although some traders consider currency ETFs to be too risky.\n\nETF.com. \"Currency ETFs: The Basics.\"\n\nCharles Schwab. \"Currency ETFs.\"\n\nVettaFi. \"JPY (Japanese Yen) ETF List.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Currency Risk.\"\n\nWorld Economic Forum. \"Why is Inflation So Low in Japan?\"\n\nBank of Japan. \"Tankan (Short-Term Economic Survey of Enterprises in Japan) Explanation,\" Pages 1, 5.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"OTC Foreign Exchange Turnover in April 2022.\"\n\nTradingView. \"Currency Pairs of the Asian Countries.\"\n\nBotman, Dennis, et al. \"The Curious Case of the Yen as a Safe Haven Currency: A Forensic Analysis.\"International Monetary Fund Working Paper WP/13/228, November 2013, pp. 1-20.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves (COFER): At A Glance.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"General Government Debt.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Japan\u2019s 2011 Earthquake and Tsunami: Economic Effects and Implications for the United States,\" Summary Page, Pages 7-8.\n\nInvesco. \"Invesco CurrencyShares Japanese Yen Trust, FXY.\"\n\nProShares. \"UltraShort Yen, YCS.\"\n\nBlackRock. \"iShares Core Nikkei 225 ETF.\"\n\nDWS. \"Xtrackers Nikkei 225 UCITS ETF.\"",
