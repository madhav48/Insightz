  "term": "What Is Effective Yield? Definition, Calculation, and Example",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe effective yield is the return on a bond that has its interest payments (or coupons) reinvested at the same rate by the bondholder. Effective yield is the total yield an investor receives, in contrast to thenominal yield\u2014which is the stated interest rate of the bond's coupon. Effective yield takes into account the power of compounding on investment returns, while nominal yield does not.\n\nThe effective yield is a measure of the coupon rate, which is the interest rate stated on a bond and expressed as a percentage of the face value. Coupon payments on a bond are typically paid semi-annually by the issuer to the bond investor. This means that the investor will receive two coupon payments per year. Effective yield is calculated by dividing the coupon payments by the current market value of the bond.\n\nEffective yield is one way that bondholders can measure their yields on bonds. There'salso the current yield, which represents a bond\u2019s annual return based on its annualcoupon paymentsand current price, as opposed to theface value.\n\nThough similar, current yield doesn't assume coupon reinvestment, as effective yield does.\n\nThe drawback of using the effective yield is that it assumes that coupon payments can be reinvested in another vehicle paying the same interest rate. This also means that it assumes the bonds are selling at par. This is not always possible, considering the fact that interest rates change periodically, falling and rising due to certain factors in the economy.\n\nThe yield-to-maturity (YTM) is the rate of return earned on a bond that is held until maturity. To compare the effective yield to theyield-to-maturity (YTM), convert the YTM to an effective annual yield. If the YTM is greater than the bond\u2019s effective yield, then the bond is trading at adiscountto par. On the other hand, if the YTM is less than the effective yield, the bond is selling at apremium.\n\nYTM is what's called abond equivalent yield(BEY). Investors can find a more precise annual yield once they know\u00a0the BEY for a bond if they account for the time value of money in the calculation. This is known as aneffective annual yield (EAY).\n\nIf an investor holds a bond with a face value of $1,000 and a 5% coupon paid semi-annually in March and September, he will receive (5%/2) x $1,000 = $25 twice a year for a total of $50 in coupon payments.\n\nHowever, the effective yield is a measure of return on a bond assuming the coupon payments are reinvested. If payments are reinvested, then his effective yield will be greater than the current yield or nominal yield, due to theeffect of compounding. Reinvesting the coupon will produce a higher yield because interest is earned on the interest payments. The investor in the example above will receive a little more than $50 annually using the effective yield evaluation. The formula for calculating effective yield is as follows:\n\nFollowing our initial example presented above, the investor\u2019s effective yield on his 5%coupon bondwill be:\n\nNote that since the bond pays interest semi-annually, payments will be made twice to the bondholder per year; hence, the number of payments per year is two.\n\nFrom the calculation above, the effective yield of 5.06% is clearly higher than the coupon rate of 5% since compounding is taken into consideration.\n\nTo understand this another way, let\u2019s scrutinize the details of the coupon payment. In March, the investor receives 2.5% x $1,000 = $25. In September, due to interest compounding, he will receive (2.5% x $1,000) + (2.5% x $25) = 2.5% x $1,025 = $25.625. This translates to an annual payment of $25 in March + $25.625 in September = $50.625. The real interest rate is, therefore, $50.625/$1,000 = 5.06%.",
