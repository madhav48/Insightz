  "definition": "Michelle P. Scott is a New York attorney with extensive experience\u00a0in tax, corporate, financial, and nonprofit law, and public policy. As General Counsel, private practitioner, and Congressional counsel, she has advised financial institutions, businesses, charities, individuals, and public officials, and written and lectured extensively.\n\nFor tax purposes, travel expenses are costs associated with traveling to conduct business-related activities. Reasonable travel expenses can generally be deducted from taxable income by a company when its employees incur costs while traveling\u00a0away from home\u00a0specifically for business. That business can include conferences or meetings.\n\nThe\u00a0Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\u00a0considers employees to be traveling if their business obligations require them to be away from their \"tax home\" (the area where their main place of business is located) for substantially longer than an ordinary workday, and they need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of their work while away.\n\nWell-organized records\u2014such as\u00a0receipts,\u00a0canceled checks,\u00a0and other documents that support a\u00a0deduction\u2014can help you get reimbursed by your employer and can help your employer prepare\u00a0tax returns. Examples of travel expenses can include:\n\nTravel expenses do not include regular commuting costs.\n\nIndividual wage earners can no longer deduct unreimbursed business expenses. That deduction was one of manyeliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Actof 2017.\n\nWhile many travel expenses can be deducted by businesses, those that are deemed unreasonable, lavish, or extravagant, or expenditures for personal purposes, may be excluded.\n\nTypes of travel expenses can include:\n\nThe use of a\u00a0personal vehicle in conjunction with a business trip, including actual mileage, tolls, and parking fees, can be included as a travel expense. The cost of using rental vehicles can also be counted as a travel expense, though only for the business-use portion of the trip. For instance, if in the course of a business trip, you visited\u00a0a family member or acquaintance, the cost of driving from the hotel to visit them would not qualify fortravel expense deductions.\n\nTravel expenses incurred while on an indefinite work assignment that lasts more than one year are not deductible for tax purposes.\n\nThe IRS allows other types of ordinary and necessary expenses to be treated as related to business travel for deduction purposes. Such expenses can include transport to and from a business meal, the hiring of a public stenographer, payment for computer rental fees related to the trip, and the shipment of luggage and display materials used for business presentations.\n\nTravel expenses can also include operating and maintaining a house trailer as part of the business trip.\n\nBusiness travel expenses can no longer be deducted by individuals.\n\nIf you are self-employed or operate your own business, you can deduct those \"ordinary and necessary\" business expenses from your return.\n\nIf you work for a company and are reimbursed for the costs of yourbusiness travel, your employer will deduct those costs at tax time.\n\nYes. Whether you're an employee claiming reimbursement from an employer or a business owner claiming a tax deduction, you need to prepare to prove your expenditures.Keep a running log of your expensesand file away the receipts as backup.\n\nReasonable travel expenses, from the viewpoint of an employer or the IRS, would include transportation to and from the business destination, accommodation costs, and meal costs. Certainly, business supplies and equipment necessary to do the job away from home are reasonable. Taxis or Ubers taken during the business trip are reasonable.\n\nUnreasonable is a judgment call. The boss or the IRS might well frown upon a bill for a hotel suite instead of a room, or a sports car rental instead of a sedan.\n\nIndividual taxpayers need no longer fret over recordkeeping for unreimbursed travel expenses. They're no longer tax deductible by individuals, at least until 2025 when the provisions in the latest tax reform package are due to expire or be extended.\n\nIf you are self-employed or own your own business, you should keep records of your business travel expenses so that you can deduct them properly.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 511, Business Travel Expenses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses,\" Page 13.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 5307, Tax Reform Basics for Individuals and Families,\" Page 7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses,\" Pages 6-7, 13-14.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 463, Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses,\" Page 4.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 5307, Tax Reform Basics for Individuals and Families,\" Pages 5, 7.",
