  "term": "What Is a Private Company?",
  "definition": "A private company is a firm held under private ownership. Private companies may issue stock and have shareholders, but their shares are not issued through aninitial public offering (IPO)and do not trade on public exchanges. Private firms are not subject to theSecurities and Exchange Commission's (SEC)filing requirements. The shares of these businesses are generally less liquid, and theirvaluationsare more difficult to determine.\n\nPrivate companies are sometimes referred to as privately held companies. They can range in size and scope, encompassing\u00a0the millions of individually owned businesses in the U.S.\u00a0and\u00a0the dozens ofunicornstartups worldwide. Private companies have different rules forshareholders, members, and taxation. In 2024, U.S. firms such as Cargill and Koch Industries, with large annual revenues, fall under the private company umbrella.\n\nRemaining\u00a0a private company can make raising money difficult. This is why many large private firms choose to go public through an IPO. While private companies access bank loans andcertain equity funding, public companies can often sell shares or raise money through bond offerings.\n\nSome family-owned companies have gone public, and many maintain family ownership and control through adual-class share structure, meaning family-owned shares can have morevoting rights.\n\nHigh costs and strict regulations are two reasons companies often remain private. Doing so allows companies to keep costs down, such as those related to an IPO, avoid burdensome paperwork likefinancial statements, orannual reports(10-K), and avoid disclosing company progress and spending to regulators and the public.\n\nPrivate means that company owners can retain more control and is especially effective for family-run companies. Koch Industries has remained in theKoch familysince its founding in 1940.Although there are many advantages to remaining private, these companies may find it difficult to raisecapital. Unlike public companies, private entities don't trade on publicstock exchanges.\n\nOwners may be liable for the financial well-being of their private companies. When a private company faces financial difficulties, the owner may be held responsible for debt and other financialobligations. This can negatively impact the owner owners'credit scores\u2014especially if the companydefaults.\n\nAvoid high costs of going public\n\nAvoid regulatory paperwork and hurdles\n\nRaising capital may be difficult\n\nFinancial liability falls on owner(s)\n\nPotential for disagreements and conflicts among partners\n\nUnlike private companies, public entities abide by the rules outlined by financial regulators, such as the SEC. This means they must be fullytransparentand file paperwork at regular intervals. These documents include quarterly and annual reports, proxy statements, changes in beneficial ownership, and income statements.\n\nKoch Industries, Cargill, Deloitte, IKEA, and Ernst & Young are all private companies. In 2022, X (formerly Twitter) was public untilElon Muskbought it and took the company private.\n\nPrivate companies range in size from small businesses to large corporations. They include a small \"mom-and-pop\" convenience store or dry cleaner, and mid-sized and large corporations.\n\nPublic companies are the opposite of private companies. Ownership of public companies is divided intoshares, which are sold to the public. This is first done through an IPO. Once that is complete, the shares of a public company are sold on thesecondary marketthrough stock exchanges. A public company's equity is held by insiders and outside investors.\n\nMany global companies are private, including IKEA, Ernst & Young, and X. The company's owner or owners retain control and aren't subject to scrutiny from regulators. These companies, however, cannot raise money through capital markets to fund their growth or pay their debts. Their shares are not sold to the public.\n\nStatista. \"America's Largest Private Companies.\"\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Choose a Business Structure.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Exchange Act Reporting and Registration.\"\n\nU.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \"Ex-99.3 4 Dex993.html Summary of Koch Industries History.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Twitter, Inc.\"",
