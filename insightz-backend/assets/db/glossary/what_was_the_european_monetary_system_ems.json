  "term": "What Was the European Monetary System (EMS)?",
  "definition": "The\u00a0European Monetary System (EMS) was an adjustable exchange rate arrangement set up in 1979 to foster closer monetary policy cooperation between members of theEuropean Community(EC). The\u00a0European Monetary System (EMS) was later succeeded by theEuropean Economic and\u00a0Monetary Union(EMU), which established a common currency, theeuro.\n\nThe EMS was created in response to the collapse of theBretton Woods Agreement. Formed in the aftermath of World War II (WWII), the Bretton Woods Agreement established an adjustablefixed foreign exchange rateto stabilize economies and consolidate global financial power among the Western Allied nations. When it was abandoned in the early 1970s, currencies began to float\u2014fluctuating in market value relative to one another\u2014which prompted members of the EC to seek out a new exchange rate agreement to complement theircustoms union.\n\nThe EMS's primary objective was to stabilizeinflationand stop large exchange\u00a0rate fluctuations between European countries. This was part of a wider, overall goal of fostering economic and political unity in Europe, which ultimately paved the way for a common currency, the euro.\n\nCurrency fluctuations were controlled through an exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The ERM was responsible for pegging national exchange rates, allowing only slight deviations from theEuropean currency unit(ECU)\u2014a composite artificial currency based on abasketof 12 EU member currencies,weightedaccording to each country\u2019s share of EU output.\u00a0The ECU served as a reference currency for exchange rate policy and determined exchange rates among the participating countries\u2019 currencies via officially sanctioned accounting methods.\n\nUnder the presidency of Jacques Delors, the \"Delors Report\" was produced that outlined how EMU could be used in place of EMS.\n\nThe early years of the EMS were marked by uneven currency values and adjustments that raised the value\u00a0of stronger currencies and lowered those of weaker ones. After 1986, changes in nationalinterest rateswere specifically used to keep all the currencies\u00a0stable.\n\nA new crisis for the EMS emerged in the early 1990s. Differing economic and political conditions of member countries, notably the reunification of Germany, led to Britain permanently withdrawing from the EMS in 1992. Britain's withdrawal foreshadowed its later insistence on independence from continental Europe; Britain refused to join theeurozone,\u00a0along with Sweden and Denmark.\n\nDuring this time, efforts to form a common currency and cement greater economic alliances were ramped up. In 1993, most EC members signed theMaastricht Treaty, establishing theEuropean Union(EU).\u00a0One year later, the EU created the European Monetary Institute, which became theEuropean Central Bank(ECB) in 1998. The primary responsibility of the ECB was to institute a single monetary policy and interest rate.\n\nAt the end of 1998, the majority of EU nations simultaneously cut their interest rates to promoteeconomic growthand prepare for the implementation of the euro. In January 1999, a unified currency, the euro, was created; the euro is used by most EU member countries. The\u00a0European Economic and\u00a0Monetary Union (EMU)\u00a0was also established, succeeding the EMS as the new name for the common monetary and economic policy organization of the EU.\n\nUnder the EMS, exchange rates could only be changed if both member countries and the European Commission were in agreement. This was an unprecedented move that attracted a lot of criticism.\n\nIn the aftermath of theglobal economic crisis of 2008-2009, significant tension between the principles of the EMS and the policies of national governments became evident.\n\nCertain member states\u2014Greece, in particular, but also\u00a0Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and Cyprus\u2014pursued policies that created high national deficits. This phenomenon was later referred to as theEuropean sovereign debt crisis.\u00a0These countries could not resort to thedevaluationof their currencies and were not allowed to spend to offset unemploymentrates.\n\nFrom the beginning, the European Monetary System (EMS) policy\u00a0intentionally prohibitedbailoutsto ailing economies in the eurozone. Despite vocal\u00a0resistance from EU members with stronger economies, the EMU finally established bailout measures to provide relief to struggling members.\n\nThe EMS was established through the introduction of the European Currency Unit in 1979. The ECU served as a basket currency, representing a weighted average of member currencies.\n\nhe primary objectives of the EMS were to achieve exchange rate stability, encourage economic convergence among member states, and create a framework for the eventual formation of the European Economic and Monetary Union. These goals aimed at fostering a more integrated and stable European economic environment.\n\nOver time, the EMS underwent several changes. The most significant change was the transition from the EMS to the European Economic and Monetary Union with the introduction of the euro in 1999. This marked a culmination of efforts to establish a single currency for the eurozone.\n\nThe collapse of the EMS occurred around 1992 and 1993 when several member states faced currency crises. The crises exposed vulnerabilities in the EMS and prompted a reevaluation of the system.\n\nThe European Monetary System was established in 1979 as a framework for monetary cooperation among European Union member states. It tried to create exchange rate stability and economic convergence. The EMS played a pivotal role in the transition to the European Economic and Monetary Union, culminating in the introduction of the euro in 1999.\n\nEurostat. \"Glossary: European Monetary System (EMS).\"\n\nIMF eLibrary. \"European Monetary System.\"\n\nEuropean Union. \"History and Purpose.\"\n\nAnnual review of Political Science. \"Understanding the Political Economy of the Eurozone Crisis.\"",
