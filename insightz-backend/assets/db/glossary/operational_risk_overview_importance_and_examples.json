  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nOperational risk summarizes a company's uncertainties and hazards when attempting to do its day-to-day business activities within a field or industry. A type ofbusiness risk, it can result from breakdowns in internal procedures, people, and systems\u2014as opposed to problems incurred from external forces, such as political or economic events, or inherent to the entire market or market segment, known assystematic risk.\n\nOperational risk management involves addressing potential weaknesses in an organization\u2019s staff, systems, and internal controls to prevent disruptions and financial losses.This type of risk can also be classified as a variety ofunsystematic risksunique to a specific company or industry.\n\nOperational risk focuses on how things are accomplished within an organization, not necessarily what is produced or inherent within an industry. These risks are often associated with active decisions relating to how the organization functions and what it prioritizes. While these risks don\u2019t always lead to failure, reduced production, or increased costs, their severity is influenced by internal management decisions.\n\nBecause it reflects man-made procedures and thinking processes, operational risk can be summarized as a human risk; it's the risk of business operations failing due to human error. It changes from industry to industry and is an important consideration when making potential investment decisions. Industries with lower human interaction are likely to have lower operational risk.\n\nManaging these risks is crucial, particularly for financial institutions, where operational losses can be unpredictable and financially significant. While traditional methods involve internal audits, processes, and insurance, the banking sector has adopted more advanced operational risk management frameworks to address growing complexities.\n\nOperational risk is a type of business risk, alongside strategic risk (failing to operate according to a plan), compliance risk (not adhering to laws and industry regulations), and reputational risk (factors that could damage an organization\u2019s image or public perception).\n\nOperational risk usually arises from four different sources: people, processes, systems, or external events. For many aspects of operational risk, companies must simply try to mitigate the risk within each category as best as possible with the understanding that some operational risk will likely always be present.\n\nOperational risk caused by people can arise due to employee deficiencies or shortages. For example, a company may not have staff with the knowledge needed to tackle a specific problem, or it may not have an appropriate number of employees on hand to properly address peak season or the busier times of the year.\n\nCompanies can simply look to markets to hire staff to mitigate these types of risks. However, this introduces new people-centric operational risks such as identifying the appropriate candidates to hire, training staff, and ensuring employee retention remains high. As each of these aspects is resource- and time-intensive, operational risks caused by people are heavily tied to financial repercussions.\n\nEvery company has its own processes. More complexmanufacturing companies(e.g., a vehicle manufacturer) will have different processes than a service-only law firm. In either case, all companies have steps that must beperformed in sequential order,or else detrimental outcomes are possible.\n\nIn many cases, especially with companies that have experienced high turnover, companies may not have fully built out their processes or documented all the steps. In addition, some processes are also at risk of being taken advantage of through collusion and failed internal controls, putting the company at risk of losing money through theft.\n\nMore and more companies are relying on software and systems to operate their businesses. Operational risk includes the chance that these systems are outdated, inadequate, or not properly set up. There are also performance considerations, as operational risk consists of the possibility that one company's systems aren't as efficient as a competitor's.\n\nThere also are operational risks relating to a system's technical aspects. Systems may have bugs or technical deficiencies, leading to more exposure tocybercrime. Systems also have capacity constraints, and a company may be increasing its risk by placing too heavy a load of expectations on what its systems can do.\n\nIn many cases, operational risk occurs outside the company. This can be anything from natural disasters that impede a company's shipping process to political changes that restrict the company's ability to operate. Some of these types of risk may be classified on their own (e.g., geopolitical risk). Others are simply a nature of business, such as a third-party defaulting on a contract agreement.\n\nOperational risk can never be 100% eliminated, and management must decide what level of operational risk it is comfortable accepting. While businesses often seek to reduce risk through contracts or agreements, external factors, such as supplier reliability, can still pose significant challenges.\n\nThe four causes described above can be expanded and broken into seven main categories of operational risk.These seven primary categories include (in no particular order):\n\nAssessing operational risk involves key risk indicators (KRIs) and data.\n\nKRIs aremetricsa company may self-assign as risk benchmarks. They can help managers monitor risk levels, signal changes in exposure, assess the effectiveness of controls, and ensure that the organization operates within its set risk appetite.For example, if a company targets working only with highly creditworthy vendors, it may set a KRI that no more than three vendors default on a contract. Throughout the year, the company can assess whether this goal is being met, identify reasons if it\u2019s not, and take steps to mitigate the risk.\n\nKRIs are most often quantifiable; it's most useful to a company to have something they can actually track and measure. For this reason, the second key part of assessment is data. Without data, a company will never know whether its KRIs are on track or deficient. Companies may seek to build out robust information-gathering processes, whether through automation, third-party surveys, financial results, or industry data.\n\nFor some companies, the operational risk areas worth tracking may have been defined for them for KRIs and data. For example, banking standards may require banks to have certain processes in place, cash on hand, or systems operating in certain ways. In these cases, the benchmarks are set for the company, and it's much easier to assess operational risk.\n\nThere are several overarching strategies and overarching principles when it comes to managing operational risk. Though every company can choose how it approaches operational risk, here are four primary ways companies manage risk.\n\nIt should go without saying, but companies should continually evaluate whether they're taking on risks with no real reward coming back to them. Consider the example above with vendors that may potentially default on contracts. Should there be equally good, if not better, vendors with better credit histories that a company could work with, it may be taking on risk by working with less-than-superior vendors.\n\nAs with all things in investing, there is usually a positive relationship between risk and returns. As companies take on more risk, they should be fairly compensated with greater returns. Therefore, companies can manage operational risk by eliminating processes that do not reward the company but instead solely incur unnecessary risk.\n\nCost/benefit analysisis a data-driven method used to evaluate whether the potential benefits of a business decision outweigh its associated costs.Similar to the concept above, companies must manage risk by comparing the risks they take with the benefits they receive. Instead of focusing solely on risk, this step entails being mindful of the rewards a company may realize from taking a risk.\n\nFor example, a company may decide to expand into an international market. This move may involve tremendous operational risk. However, if the market is untapped and proper research has been conducted, the reward of expanding the business may far outweigh the operational risk. Sometimes, companies need to understand that risk is necessary to manage risk.\n\nFor companies to make the wisest decisions, it's usually best for upper management to decide how to approach operational risk. These team members often have the greatest insights into a company and know larger strategies that may work together.\n\nUsing the example above, a senior management team member should be assigned responsibility for the decision-making of the international expansion. That executive should work with members across all company teams to better understand the logistics, legal, procurement, and shipment risks. This type of responsibility isn't suitable for an individual contributor at a lower level.\n\nOne of the most important aspects of managing risk is understanding when it is approaching and anticipating its outcomes. By so doing, companies can preemptively decide whether to accept, mitigate, or avoid risk.\n\nIn the international expansion example above, a company can easily perform vast research to better understand geographical limitations, political risks, or consumer preference differences in this new market. The first step to accepting or managing risk is to understand what may happen in the future and have a plan to overcome it.\n\nIn a corporate context,financial riskrefers to the possibility that a company's cash flow will prove inadequate to meet its obligations\u2014that is, its loan repayments and other debts. Although this inability could relate to or result from decisions made by management (especially company finance professionals), as well as the performance of the company products, financial risk is considered distinct from operational risk. It's most often related to the company's use of financial leverage and debt financing, rather than the day-to-day efforts of making the company a profitable enterprise.\n\nMarket riskis usually referred to as the risk of price movements for a financial instrument. These changes in price are often based on investor disposition towards a stock and a company, interest rates, or economic factors. Whereas market risk is primarily focused on investments and securities, operational risk is mostly focused on the internal operations of a company, its resources, and its people.\n\nThese two types of risks may blend together in certain areas, though the greatest distinction is that strategic risk is usually long-term and may involve more external parties. A new competitor entering a market is a strategic risk, though how the company handles that on a day-to-day basis is an operational risk. The competitor may have also decided to enter the market because they felt their level of operational risk could be less than that of other companies.\n\nOne area that may involve operational risk is the maintenance of necessary systems and equipment. If two maintenance activities are required, but it is determined that only one can be afforded at the time, choosing to perform one over the other alters the operational risk depending on which system is left in disrepair. If a system fails, the negative impact is associated directly with the operational risk.\n\nOther areas that qualify as operational risk tend to involve the personnel within the organization. It is considered an operational risk, for example, if a sales-oriented business chooses to maintain a subpar sales staff due to its lower salary costs or another factor. The same can be said for failing to properly maintain a staff to avoid certain risks. In a manufacturing company, for example, choosing not to have a qualified mechanic on staff, and having to rely onthird partiesfor that work, can be classified as an operational risk. Not only does this impact the smooth functioning of a system, but it also involves additional time delays.\n\nThe willing participation of employees in fraudulent activity may also be seen as an operational risk. In this case, the risk involves the possibility of repercussions if the activity is uncovered. Since individuals make a decision to commit fraud, it is considered a risk relating to how the business operates.\n\nCompanies often gauge risk by determining whether it is highly likely, likely, possible, unlikely, or highly unlikely that an event will occur. Highly likely is often assigned a percentage of greater than 90%, while likely includes a range that is always above 50%. Management uses these percentages to determine the best course of action when evaluating the cost of mitigation against the cost of a detrimental outcome.\n\nOperational risk is identified by assessing what could go wrong in the day-to-day aspects of a company. Management often identifies operational risk by asking questions such as \"what if a certain system breaks down?\" or \"what if a certain supplier is unable to deliver goods on time?\" Management can come up countless areas of operational risk; it is up to that team to decide which aspects are most important to mitigate and which to accept.\n\nThe four T's of risk management are:\n\nSenior management is often responsible for managing operational risk by being aware of what risks are in place and the strategies for overcoming them. Though lower-level field managers are more involved in a company's day-to-day aspects, senior management should oversee their activities to make sure the operational risk strategies are being properly carried out.\n\nOperational risk is the risk of loss resulting from many normal aspects of business. This includes the risk of loss caused by failed processes, unskilled employees, inadequate systems, or external events. In many ways, operational risk can't be avoided as it is part of the daily business activity of a company. In other ways, companies can seek to reduce, mitigate, or accept operational risk.\n\nThe Open University. \"3.2 Operational Risk Management.\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Operational Risk Management: An Evolving Discipline.\"\n\nCompTIA Community. \"7 Types of Business Risk.\"\n\nAmerican Public University. \"What Are the Various Risks in Supply Chain Management?\"\n\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision. \"Sound Practices for the Management and Supervision of Operational Risk.\"\n\nThe Institute of Operational Risk. \"Key Risk Indicators.\"\n\nHarvard Business School Online. \"How to Do a Cost-Benefit Analysis & Why It's Important.\"",
