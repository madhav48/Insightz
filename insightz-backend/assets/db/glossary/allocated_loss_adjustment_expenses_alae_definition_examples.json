  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAllocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)\u00a0are costs attributed to the processing of a specific insurance claim. ALAE\u00a0is part of an insurer\u2019s expense reserves. It is one of the largestexpensesfor which an insurer has to set aside funds, along withcontingent commissions.\n\nAllocated loss adjustment expenses, along withunallocated loss adjustment expenses(ULAE), represent an insurer's estimate of the money it will pay out in claims and\u00a0expenses. Insurers set aside reserves for these expenses\u00a0to\u00a0ensure\u00a0claims aren't\u00a0made fraudulently and\u00a0to process legitimate claims quickly.\n\nALAEs link\u00a0directly to the processing of a specific claim. These costs may include payments tothird partiesfor activities like investigating claims, acting as loss adjusters,\u00a0or as legal counsel for the insurer. Expenses associated with ULAE are more general and may include overhead, investigations, and salaries.\n\nLife insurance companies that use in-house employees for field adjustments would report that expense as an unallocated loss adjustment expense.\n\nSome commercial liability policies contain endorsements,\u00a0which require the policyholder to reimburse its insurance company for loss adjustment expenses (ALAE or ULAE).Adjusting a loss is \"the process of ascertaining the value of a loss or negotiating a settlement.\"\n\nTherefore, loss adjustment expenses are most often\u00a0those\u00a0costs incurred by an insurance company in defending or settling a liability claim brought against its policyholder. These expenses can include fees charged by attorneys, investigators, experts,arbitrators, mediators, and other fees or expenses incidental to adjusting a claim.\n\nIt is important to carefully read the\u00a0endorsement language, which\u00a0may say that a loss adjustment expense\u00a0is not intended to include the policyholder\u2019s attorney fees and\u00a0costs if an\u00a0insurer denies coverage and a\u00a0policyholder successfully sues the insurer.\u00a0In this situation, where the insurance company has done no actual \u201cadjusting\u201d of the claim, it should not be entitled to apply its deductible to the expenses incurred by the policyholder in defending the claim abandoned by the\u00a0insurance company.\n\nInsurers have gradually shifted from categorizing expenses as ULAE to categorizing them as ALAE. This is primarily because insurers are more sophisticated in how they treat claims\u00a0and have more tools at their disposal to manage the costs associated with claims.\n\nSmall, straightforward claims are the easiest for an insurance company to settle\u00a0and often require less ALAE when compared to claims that may take years to settle. Claims that could result in substantial losses are the most likely to receive extra scrutiny by insurers\u00a0and may involve in-depth investigations, settlement offers, and litigation. With greater scrutiny comes greater cost.\n\nAnalysts can tell how accurate an insurance company has been at estimating its reserves by examining itsloss reservedevelopment. Loss reserve development involves an insurer adjusting estimates to its loss andloss adjustment expensereserves over a period of time.\n\nAllocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)\u00a0are costs attributed to the processing of a specific insurance claim.
