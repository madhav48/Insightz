  "term": "What Are Actual Deferral Percentage and Actual Contribution Percentage Tests?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) and Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) tests are two tests\u00a0that companies must conduct to ensure that their 401(k) plans don't unfairly benefit highly paid employees at the expense of others.\n\nCompanies that offer 401(k) plans must conduct the tests in order to retain the qualified status of their plans underInternal Revenue Service (IRS)rules and theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).\n\nIf the plan fails either test, the employer must take corrective action in the 12-month period following the close of the plan year in which the oversight occurred. Failure to do so can result in penalties, plan disqualification, andfiduciaryliability on the part of the employer.\n\nThe ADP test compares the average salary deferral percentages\u00a0ofhighly compensated employees(HCEs) to those of non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs). An HCE is any employee who owns more than 5% interest in the company at any time during the current or\u00a0previous plan year or\u00a0earned more than $155,000 during the 2024 tax year.\n\nThe ADP test takes into account bothpre-tax deferralsandafter-tax Roth deferrals, but nocatch-up contributions, which may be made only by employees aged 50 and over. To pass the test, the ADP of the HCE may not exceed the ADP of the NHCE by more than\u00a0two percentage points. In addition, the combined contributions of all HCEs\u00a0may not be more than two times the percentage of\u00a0NHCE\u00a0contributions.\n\nThe ACP test uses a similar method as the ADP test, except that it usesmatching contributionsand employeeafter-tax contributions.\n\nWhen employers fail the ADP test and/or the ACP test, they can remedy the failure by refunding excess contributions back to HCEs in the amount necessary to pass the test. However, these refunds will be liable forincome taxfor the HCEs.\n\nSome companies set buffer zones within their plan documents to steer plans away from potentially failing the ADP/ACP tests in the first place. One option is setting a cap on contributions by HCEs. Another option is to place a contribution limit on HCEs at the point where the plan would fail the ADP/ACP tests. Setting plan buffer zones may require employers to conduct ADP/ACP test projections, typically in the middle of the plan year, to determine if any restrictions need to be applied.\n\nStill, some companies use asafe harbor401(k) plan\u00a0to avoid the ADP/ACP tests entirely.\n\nSafe harbor 401(k) plans allow sponsors to bypass ADP, ACP, and other non-discrimination\u00a0testing in exchange for providing eligible matching ornonelective contributionson\u00a0behalf of their employees.\n\nTo qualify for safe harbor, a company must provide a basic match, such as a 100% match on the first 3% of deferred compensation and a 50% match on deferrals of 3% to 6%. They may also provide each employee with a nonelective contribution of at least 3% of compensation, regardless of how much the employee contributes or if they contribute at all.\n\nThe Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test looks at the amount of pay that an employee has earmarked for a 401(k) retirement plan. It examines pretax and Roth deferrals. It compares high-earning employees with other employees to ensure that the plan treats everyone fairly.\n\nThe Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) test, like the Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test, ensures that 401(k) plans treat all employees equitably, regardless of how much they make. The ACP test examines employer matching and after-tax contributions.\n\nThe Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) and Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) tests ensure that 401(k) plans don't favor higher-paid employees. Companies' retirement plans must pass these tests for the plans to remain qualified under the IRS. Failing these tests can lead to penalties and potential fiduciary liability. To avoid this, some companies choose to offer a safe harbor 401(k) instead.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"COLA Increases for Dollar Limitations on Benefits and Contributions.\"",
