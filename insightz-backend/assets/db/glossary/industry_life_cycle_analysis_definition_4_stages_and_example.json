  "term": "Industry Life Cycle Analysis: Definition, 4 Stages, and Example",
  "definition": "Industry life cycle analysis is part of thefundamental analysisof a company involving the examination of the stage an industry is in at a given point in time. There are four stages in an industry life cycle: expansion, peak, contraction, trough. An analyst will determine where a company sits in the cycle and use this information to project future financial performance and estimate forward valuations (e.g.,forward price-earningsratios).\n\nThough not necessarily the case, the life cycle of a particular industry will follow the generaleconomic cycle. An industry life cycle may lead or lag an economic cycle. It also can vary from an economic cycle's phases in terms of expansion or contraction percentages or duration of peak and trough stages.\n\nAs the economy gathers strength, the industry life cycle begins again with the expansion phase. As mentioned at the outset, an industry life cycle is typically tied to the economic cycle. The entertainment and leisure industry is an example of such an industry. The technology industry, on the other hand, has exhibited life cycle movements at variance with the economic cycle. For instance, tech industry profits have boomed even in times of no economic growth.\n\nAnalysts and traders often use industry life cycle analysis to measure the relative strength and weakness of a particular company's stock. A company's future growth prospects may be bright (or dim) depending on the stage that it is in during an industry life cycle.Porter's five economic forceschange as an industry matures.\n\nFor example, rivalry is most intense between companies in a sector during the growth stage. Startups slash prices and ship products as quickly as possible in a bid to garner as many customers as possible. During this time, the threat of new entrants eating into an existing company's market share is high.\n\nThe scenario changes in the maturity stage. Less competitive startups and inferior products are weeded out or acquired. The risk of new entrants is low and the industry's product is mature enough to be accepted in mainstream society. Startups become established firms during this stage but their future growth prospects are limited in existing markets. They must search out new avenues and markets for profits or risk extinction.\n\nThere was a boom in social media during the early 2000s due to the success of Myspace, a social networking site that surpassed Google as the most visited place on the internet in 2006.Sites like Orkut (a Google venture) and Bebo competed to gain users in a crowded landscape. Facebook (now Meta), which started in 2004, was also gaining traction among universities and was considered the second most popular social media site.There were signs of consolidation when Myspace was acquired by Rupert Murdoch's Newscorp. Ltd for $580 million in 2005.\n\nBut that valuation turned out to be inflated after Facebook overtook MySpace in rankings.MySpace eventually petered into insignificance after Facebook became a social media behemoth. With the exception of a few, like X platform (formerly Twitter), other social media sites also fell by the wayside. The social media sites that survived made a thumping debut on the stock market. Their valuations were considered high in comparison to their revenues, mainly because investors expected significant growth in the future as social media became popular throughout the world.\n\nBy May 2019, however, Facebook's valuation had declined and the company warned of plateauing growth figures in the future. Snap Inc., another social media company, was in a similar situation. Both companies responded by expanding the scope of their operations to include other products, such as cameras and drones, in their portfolio.\n\nAs of December 2021, Facebook has just changed its corporate parent name to Meta Platforms.The company has rebranded and is developing new products and technology. These developments resulted in both analysts and the company itself seeing Meta's valuation increase again.\n\nThe phases ofan industry life cycle have the same names as the general economic cycle: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. These phases may overlap, with an industry's peak occurring at the same time as an economic peak, and an industry's trough at the same as an economic trough. However, whether or not this happens often depends on the industry itself. Some industries may see their peaks at the same time as the overall economy experiences a trough, or they may be in an expansion phase when the economic cycle is at a peak.\n\nThe product life cycle has to do with how specific products or services are developed and offered to the public. This cycle has five phases: development, introduction, growth, maturity, and decline. This is separate from the industry life cycle since many products are developed within a single industry, or even within a single company.\n\nPerforming overall industry analysis requires looking at three things: the overall appeal (or attractiveness) of an industry, both to customers and investors; the factors that determine an individual company's success or failure within an industry; and the wider economic, political, and social forces that influence an industry.\n\nThe industry life cycle is thestages of growth and declinethat an industry goes through as it is created, expands, and eventually becomes extinct. This mirrors the four main stages of the economic cycle: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.\n\nIndustry life cycle analysis is used to analyze a company's stock. Researchers, analysts, and investors can look at the overall stage of an industry's life cycle to understand why a company's stock is valued the way it currently is and whether that is likely to change in the future.\n\nSocial Science Research Network (SSRN). \"Facebook: A Case Study of Strategic Leadership,\" Download \"Download This Paper.\"\n\nMeta. \"Introducing Meta: A Social Technology Company.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Exhibit 99: News Corporation to Acquire Intermix Media, Inc.
