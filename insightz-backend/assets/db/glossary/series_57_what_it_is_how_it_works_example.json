The candidate must also pass the SIE to become registered as a securities trader.\n\nThe Series 57 exam has received several updates over the year that reflect ongoing changes in the industry. The most recent substantial change to the exam occurred in January 2017, when new sections regardinghigh-frequency trading (HFT)were added.
