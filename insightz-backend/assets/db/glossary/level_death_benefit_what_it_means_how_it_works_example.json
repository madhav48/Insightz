There are also policies that offer the option of an increasing death benefit, which rises in value over time.\n\nGenerally speaking, life insurance policies with level death benefits will charge lower premiums than those with increasing death benefits. However, this does not necessarily mean that level death benefits offer superior value since inflation can reduce the level death benefit\u2019s real value over time.\n\nWhen you buy a life insurancepolicy, you pick adeath benefitfor your coverage. This is the amount your heirs receive if you pass away while insured. A level death benefit policy provides the same payout the entire time you're insured. If you sign up for $500,000 in coverage, that's what the policy will pay out tomorrow, a year from now, or a decade in the future, assuming you keep your life insurance coverage. Level death benefits are available with bothterm life insuranceandpermanent life insurancepolicies.\n\nIn comparison, there are also life insurance policies that change the death benefit over time. An increasing death benefit policy grows the payout over time. These policies cost more than one with a level death benefit.\n\nA decreasing term policy reduces your death benefit over time. In exchange, a decreasing term policy costs less than one with a level death benefit. You might use a decreasing term policy for a need that goes down over time, like your mortgage. As you pay off your home, you need less life insurance to cover the remaining debt.\n\nFrom the perspective of the insurance company, level death benefits are relatively low risk because they allow the insurer to know with certainty what their maximum potentialliabilitywill be when the insured dies. This lower risk means policies with level death benefits are still generally less expensive than those with increasing death benefits that are more difficult to predict.\n\nMoreover, because ofinflation, thereal valueof the level death benefit actually declines each year. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because prices go up over time. The level death benefit might be appropriate for your family today, but could be too small a payout many years in the future.\n\nIf you are worried about inflation reducing the value of your death benefit, you could buy an extra inflation rider benefit. This feature increases your death benefit over time to match rising prices. How this works depends on the insurance company. In exchange for inflation protection, you must pay a higher premium.\n\nThe decision of whether to opt for a level death benefit or anincreasing death benefitwill depend on several factors, including your personal budget and your expectations of alternative investmentreturns.\n\nTo illustrate, consider the case of John, a hypothetical insurance shopper. At 30 years of age, John is in perfect health and has an annual income of $70,000. After paying for his expenses, John is able to save $700 per month. He is eager to purchase life insurance to help provide for his young family in case he passes away.\n\nIf John opts for a level death benefit of $500,000 on a whole life policy in Florida, then his insurance premium will be around $300 per month, according to a quote fromQuotacy. This leaves him $400 to invest separately. John plans to leave the proceeds from his investments to his family. Thus, when he dies, his family will receive both the $500,000 death benefit and the value of his investments at that time.\n\nThe effects ofcompound interestover time should not be underestimated. Even relatively modest investment returns can lead to very large sums when allowed to compound over the long-term.\n\nJohn calculates that if he lives for 50 more years and inflation averages 3% per year during that time frame, the real value of the $500,000 benefit at that time, after adjusting for inflation, would only be about $114,000 in today's dollars. This is why it's important to save extra for your heirs if you use a level death benefit policy. Your initial death benefit provides much less spending power in the future when you account for inflation.\n\nGiven his longinvestment horizon, John estimates he can obtain an average annual return of 6% on his monthly investments of $400. These would be worth more than $1.5 million in 50 years\u2019 time. With these observations in mind, John decides to proceed with the level death benefit, with the intention of investing an additional $400 per month on his family\u2019s behalf for the remainder of his life.\n\nLevel death benefits are commonly found on term life and whole life policies (although each offers optional provisions that can increase the death benefit over time). For universal life and variable life policies, you can choose either a level or increasing death benefit option at issue, with the ability to flip between the two options throughout the life of the policy. You can also have the flexibility to increase or decrease the death benefit if your needs change in the future.\n\nNormally, yes. Insurance companies can charge less for a level death benefit policy because the insurer can more accurately forecast their future financial liability. The eventually payout for an increasing death benefit is less precise to anticipate.\n\nOver time, rising inflation rates will slowly reduce the real value of the death benefit for a level death benefit policy. Many carriers offer options available tocounteract inflation, including buying inflation protection riders and planned face-amount increases.\n\nWhether a level death benefit life insurance policy offers the best protection for you and your family depends on your individual circumstances and needs. Level death benefits offer predictable payouts and premiums, but will lose some of their value to inflation. To make the best decision, contact your insurance agent to discuss your long-term financial plan.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners.\"Life Insurance.\"\n\nNorth Carolina Department of Insurance.\"Life Insurance Options.\"\n\nProgressive. \"What Is Decreasing Term Insurance?\"\n\nGerber Life.\"What Inflation Means for Life Insurance.\"\n\nFidelity Life. \"What Is an Inflation Rider?\"\n\nNew York Life.\"Universal Life Insurance.\"\n\nUnited Benefits.How Does Inflation Impact Life Insurance?",
