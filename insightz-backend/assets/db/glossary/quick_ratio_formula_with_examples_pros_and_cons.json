The quick ratio is used to evaluate the strength of a company's cash position.\n\nThe quick ratio is sometimes called theacid test ratio.\n\nMadelyn Goodnight / Investopedia\n\nThere are a few different ways to calculate the quick ratio. The most common approach is to add the most liquid assets and divide the total by current liabilities:\n\nQuickRatio=\u201cQuickAssets\u201dCurrentLiabilities\\begin{aligned}&\\textbf{Quick Ratio}\\mathbf{=}\\frac{\\textbf{``Quick Assets''}}{\\textbf{Current Liabilities}}\\end{aligned}\u200bQuick\u00a0Ratio=Current\u00a0Liabilities\u201cQuick\u00a0Assets\u201d\u200b\u200b\n\nQuick assets are defined as the most liquid current assets that can easily be exchanged for cash. For most companies, quick assets are limited to just a few types of assets:\n\nQuickAssets=Cash+CE+MS+NARwhere:CE=Cash\u00a0equivalentsMS=Marketable\u00a0securitiesNAR=Net\u00a0accounts\u00a0receivable\\begin{aligned}&\\textbf{Quick Assets}\\mathbf{=}\\textbf{Cash}\\mathbf{+}\\textbf{CE}\\mathbf{+}\\textbf{MS}\\mathbf{+}\\textbf{NAR}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\text{CE}=\\text{Cash equivalents}\\\\&\\text{MS}=\\text{Marketable securities}\\\\&\\text{NAR}=\\text{Net accounts receivable}\\end{aligned}\u200bQuick\u00a0Assets=Cash+CE+MS+NARwhere:CE=Cash\u00a0equivalentsMS=Marketable\u00a0securitiesNAR=Net\u00a0accounts\u00a0receivable\u200b\n\nDepending on what type of current assets a company has on its balance sheet, a company may also calculate quick assets by deducting illiquid current assets from itsbalance sheet. For example, consider that inventory and prepaid expenses may not be easily or quickly converted to cash; a company may calculate quick assets as follows:\n\nQuickAssets=TCA\u2212Inventory\u2212PEwhere:TCA=Total\u00a0current\u00a0assetsPE=Prepaid\u00a0expenses\\begin{aligned}&\\textbf{Quick Assets}\\mathbf{=}\\textbf{TCA}\\mathbf{-}\\textbf{Inventory}\\mathbf{-}\\textbf{PE}\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\textbf{TCA}=\\text{Total current assets}\\\\&\\textbf{PE}=\\text{Prepaid expenses}\\end{aligned}\u200bQuick\u00a0Assets=TCA\u2212Inventory\u2212PEwhere:TCA=Total\u00a0current\u00a0assetsPE=Prepaid\u00a0expenses\u200b\n\nRegardless of which method is used to calculate quick assets, the calculation for current liabilities is the same, as all current liabilities are included in the formula.\n\nThe quick ratio measures the dollar amount of\u00a0liquid assets\u00a0available against the dollar amount of current liabilities of a company.\n\nLiquid assetsare thosecurrent assetsthat can be quickly converted into cash with minimal impact on the price received in the\u00a0open market, whilecurrent liabilitiesare a company\u2019s debts or obligations that are due to be paid to creditors within one year.\n\nA company that has a quick ratio of less than one may not be able to fully pay off its current liabilities in the short term, while a company having a quick ratio higher than one can instantly get rid of its current liabilities.\n\nFor instance, a quick ratio of 1.5 indicates that a company has $1.50 of liquid assets available to cover each $1 of its current liabilities.\n\nWhile suchnumbers-based ratiosoffer insight into the viability and certain aspects of a business, they may not provide a complete picture of the overall health of the business. It is important to look at other associated measures to assess the true picture of a company\u2019s financial health.\n\nThe higher the quick ratio, the better a company\u2019s liquidity and financial health, but it is important to look at other related measures to assess the whole picture of a company\u2019s financial health.\n\nCash is among the more straightforward pieces of the quick ratio. A company should strive to reconcile its cash balance to monthly bank statements received from its financial institutions. This cash component may include cash from foreign countries translated to a single denomination.\n\nCash equivalents are often an extension of cash, as this account often houses investments with very low risk and high liquidity. Cash equivalents often include but may not necessarily be limited to Treasury bills, certificates of deposits (being mindful of options/fees to break the CD), bankers\u2019 acceptances, corporate commercial paper, or other money market instruments.\n\nIn a publication by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), digital assets such as cryptocurrency or digital tokens may not be reported as cash or cash equivalents.\n\nMarketable securitiesare usually free from such time-bound dependencies. However, to maintain precision in the calculation, one should consider only the amount to be actually received in 90 days or less under normal terms. Early liquidation or premature withdrawal of assets like interest-bearing securities may lead to penalties or discounted book value.\n\nWhetheraccounts receivableis a source of quick, ready cash remains a debatable topic, and it depends on the credit terms that the company extends to its customers. A company that needs advance payments or allows only 30 days for customers to pay will be in a better liquidity position than a company that gives 90 days.\n\nOn the other hand, a company could negotiate the rapid receipt of payments from its customers and secure longer terms of payment from its suppliers, which would keep liabilities on the books longer. By converting accounts receivable to cash faster, it may have a healthier quick ratio and be fully equipped to pay off its current liabilities.\n\nThe total accounts receivable balance should be reduced by the estimated amount of uncollectible receivables. As the quick ratio only wants to reflect the cash that could be on hand, the formula should not include any receivables that a company does not expect to receive.\n\nThe quick ratio pulls all current liabilities from a company\u2019s balance sheet, as it does not attempt to distinguish between when payments may be due. The quick ratio assumes that all current liabilities have a near-term due date.\n\nTotal current liabilities are often calculated as the sum of various accounts, including accounts payable, wages payable, current portions of long-term debt, and taxes payable.\n\nBecause prepaid expenses may not be refundable and inventory may be difficult to convert to cash quickly without severe product discounts, both are excluded from the asset portion of the quick ratio.\n\nThe quick ratio is more conservative than thecurrent ratiobecause it excludes inventory and other current assets, which are generally more difficult to turn into cash.\n\nThe quick ratio considers only assets that can be converted to cash in a short period of time. The current ratio, on the other hand, considers inventory and prepaid expense assets.\n\nIn most companies,inventorytakes time to liquidate, although a few rare companies can turn their inventory fast enough to consider it a quick asset.Prepaid expenses, though an asset, cannot be used to pay for current liabilities, so they\u2019re omitted from the quick ratio.\n\nThe quick ratio has the advantage of being a more conservative estimate of how liquid a company is. Compared to other calculations that include potentially illiquid assets, the quick ratio is often a better true indicator of short-term cash capabilities.\n\nThe quick ratio is also fairly easy and straightforward to calculate. It\u2019s relatively easy to understand, especially when comparing a company\u2019s liquidity against a target calculation such as 1.0. The quick ratio can be used to analyze a single company over a period of time or can be used to compare similar companies.\n\nThere are several downsides to the quick ratio. The financial metric does not give any indication of a company\u2019s future cash flow activity. Though a company may be sitting on $1 million today, the company may not be selling a profitable product and may struggle to maintain its cash balance in the future.\n\nThere are also considerations to make regarding the true liquidity of accounts receivable as well as marketable securities in some situations.\n\nConservative approach to estimating a company\u2019s liquidity\n\nRelatively straightforward to calculate\n\nAll components are reported on a company\u2019s balance sheet\n\nCan be used to compare companies across time periods or sectors\n\nDoes not consider future cash flow capabilities of the company\n\nDoes not consider long-term liabilities (some of which may be due as early as 12 months from now)\n\nMay overstate the true collectability of accounts receivable\n\nMay overstate the true liquidity of marketable securities during economic downturns\n\nPublicly traded companies may report the quick ratio figure under the \u201cLiquidity/Financial Health\u201d heading in the \u201cKey Ratios\u201d section of their quarterly reports.\n\nBelow is the calculation of the quick ratio based on the figures that appear on the balance sheets\u00a0of two leading competitors operating in the personal care industrial sector, ABC and XYZ.\n\nWith a quick ratio of over 1.0, XYZ appears to be in a decent position to cover its current liabilities, as its liquid assets are greater than the total of its short-term debt obligations. ABC, on the other hand, may not be able to pay off its current obligations using only quick assets, as its quick ratio is well below 1, at 0.45.\n\nThis shows that, disregarding profitability or income, XYZ appears to be in better short-term financial health regarding its ability to meet its short-term debt requirements.\n\nThe quick ratio is a way to check if a company has enough cash and other easily accessible money to pay its short-term bills. It looks at only the most liquid assets\u2014things that can be quickly turned into cash\u2014like money in the bank and payments from customers that will arrive soon.\n\nBy comparing these quick assets to the company's short-term debts, the quick ratio shows whether the company can pay what it owes without selling anything extra, like inventory.\n\nA higher quick ratio means the company is in a stronger financial position, while a lower ratio could mean it might have a hard time covering its immediate expenses.\n\nThe quick ratio looks at only the most liquid assets that a company has available to service short-term debts and obligations. Liquid assets are those that can quickly and easily be converted into cash in order to pay those bills.\n\nThe quick ratio communicates how well a company will be able to pay its short-term debts using only the most liquid of assets. The ratio is important because it signals to internal management and external investors whether the company will run out of cash. The quick ratio also holds more value than other liquidity ratios, such as the current ratio, because it has the most conservative approach to reflecting how a company can raise cash.\n\nIn general, a higher quick ratio is better. This is because the formula\u2019s numerator (the most liquid current assets) will be higher than the formula\u2019s denominator (the company\u2019s current liabilities). A higher quick ratio signals that a company can be more liquid and generate cash quickly in case of an emergency.\n\nKeep in mind that a very high quick ratio may not be better. For example, a company may be sitting on a very large cash balance. This capital could be used to generate company growth or invest in new markets. There is often a fine line between balancing short-term cash needs and spending capital for long-term potential.\n\nThe quick ratio only looks at the most liquid assets on a firm\u2019s balance sheet, so it gives the most immediate picture of liquidity available if needed in a pinch, making it the most conservative measure of liquidity. The current ratio also includes less liquid assets such as inventories and other current assets such as prepaid expenses.\n\nIn this case, aliquidity crisiscan arise even at healthy companies if circumstances arise that make it difficult to meet short-term obligations, such as repaying their loans and paying their employees or suppliers.\n\nOne example of a far-reaching liquidity crisis from history is the global credit crunch of 2007\u201308, where many companies found themselves unable to secure short-term financing to pay their immediate obligations. If new financing cannot be found, the company may be forced to liquidate assets in a fire sale or seek bankruptcy protection.\n\nA company can\u2019t exist withoutcash flowand the ability to pay its bills as they come due. By measuring its quick ratio, a company can better understand what resources it has in the very short term in case it needs to liquidate current assets.\n\nThough other liquidity ratios measure a company\u2019s ability to be solvent in the short term, the quick ratio is among the most aggressive in deciding short-term liquidity capabilities.\n\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cAccounting for and Auditing of Digital Assets.\u201d",
