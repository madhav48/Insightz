Governed by theInternal Revenue Code, it tracks funds coming in as well as funds going out. Unlike financial accounting, it only focuses on transactions that affect taxes.\n\nIn the United States, there are two sets of accounting principles: tax accounting principles and financial accounting principles, orgenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nUnder GAAP, companies must follow a\u00a0common set of accounting principles, standards, and procedures when they compile their financial statements by accounting for any and all financial transactions.Balance sheetitems can be accounted for differently when preparingfinancial statementsand tax payables. For example, companies can prepare their financial statements implementing the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method to record their inventory for financial purposes, yet they can implement the last-in-first-out (LIFO) approach for tax purposes. The latter procedure reduces the current year's taxes payable.\n\nWhile accounting encompasses all financial transactions to some degree, tax accounting focuses solely on those transactions that affect an entity's tax burden, and how those items relate to proper tax calculation and tax document preparation. Tax accounting is regulated by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)to ensure that all associated tax laws are adhered to by tax accounting professionals and individual taxpayers.The IRS also requires the use of specific documents and forms to properly submit tax information as required by law.\n\nHiring a professional tax accountant is optional for an individual, but often necessary for a corporation, as business taxes are more complicated than personal taxes.\n\nFor an individual taxpayer, tax accounting focuses solely on items such as income, qualifyingdeductions, investmentgainsor losses, and other transactions that affect the individual\u2019s tax burden.This limits the amount of information that is necessary for an individual to manage an annual tax return, and while a taxaccountantcan be used by an individual, it is not a legal requirement.\n\nMeanwhile, general\u00a0accounting would involve the tracking of all funds coming in and out of the persons' possession regardless of the purpose, including personal expenses that have no tax implications.\n\nFrom a business perspective, more information must be analyzed as part of the tax accounting process. While the company\u2019s earnings, or incoming funds, must be tracked just as they are for the individual, there is an additional level of complexity regarding any outgoing funds directed towards certain business obligations. This can include funds directed towards specificbusiness expensesas well as funds directed towardsshareholders.\n\nWhile it is also not required that a business use a tax accountant to perform these duties, it is fairly common in larger organizations due to the complexity of the records involved.\n\nEven in instances where an organization is tax-exempt, tax accounting is necessary. This is due to the fact that most organizations must fileannual returns.They must provide information regarding any incoming funds, such as grants or donations, as well as how the funds are used during the organization\u2019s operation. This helps ensure that the organization adheres to all laws and regulations governing the proper operation of a tax-exempt entity.\n\nTax accounting is used to make the proper tax calculations and prepare tax documents in time for filing season.\n\nA management accountant is an internal party who can't work with external clients, while a tax accountant is an external party who can work with other businesses and individuals. Management accountants assist their own companies with the financial implications of business decisions and provide strategic advice. Tax accountants help companies and individuals comply with taxation requirements.\n\nTax accountants need aCertified Public Accountant (CPA)licensure.This usually requires a bachelor's degree in an accounting-related field. And though it's not required, CPA candidates should consider completing a master's program in accounting. Tax accountants often must take continuing education (CE) courses to maintain their credentials. The CE requirements and length vary by state.\n\nTax accounting is a set of methods for accounting and a useful tool that companies use to understand their tax liability and avoid penalties. Tax accounting is key not only for businesses but also for individuals to declare the correct income, pay appropriate taxes, and avoid penalties or IRS audits.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"All About Auditors: What Investors Need to Know.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Understanding the Tax Treatment of Inventory: The Role of LIFO.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"The Agency, Its Mission, and Statutory Authority.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1120, U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Charities and Nonprofits: Annual Filing and Forms.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Understanding Tax Return Preparer Credentials and Qualifications.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"How to Become an Accountant or Auditor.\"",
