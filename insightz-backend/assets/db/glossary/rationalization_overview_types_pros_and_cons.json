  "definition": "Michela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nRationalization is thereorganizationof a company in order to increase its operatingefficiency. This sort of reorganization may lead to an expansion or reduction in company size, a change of policy, or an alteration of strategy pertaining to particular products offered.\n\nSimilar to a reorganization, a rationalization is more widespread, encompassing strategy as well asstructural changes. Rationalization is necessary for a company to increase revenue, decrease costs, and improve itsbottom line.\n\nRationalization may also refer to the process of becoming calculable. For example, the introduction of certainfinancial modelsor financial technologies rationalizes markets and makes them more efficient. The introduction of theBlack-Scholesmodel for options pricing, for instance, helped to rationalize theoptionsmarkets in Chicago in the late 1970s.\n\nIn the business world, rationalization is a process that most organizations consider. That\u2019s because it\u2019s aimed at improving efficiency, getting rid of waste, standardizing processes, and ultimately boosting the bottom line.\n\nDepending on the company and strategy, rationalization can result in the expansion or reduction in the size of the firm. It can also lead to structural changes.\n\nSpecifically, the process of rationalization may involve corporate actions including sales or closures of underperforming business segments, the expansion of outperforming segments, a complete restructuring of the company\u2019s financial structure, and a streamlining or modernizing of manufacturing or other operations.\n\nIn a large number of cases, asset rationalization results in the loss of hundreds of jobs.\n\nExamining a company\u2019s application portfolio is important to attain more efficient operations and cost integrations, reducing stranded costs left by asellerand streamlining the portfolio to best serve the business.\n\nThere are several reasons that a particular organization might need to go through the process of rationalization. They include the need to:\n\nThe process of rationalizing is especially common during recessions and after corporate actions such as a merger, acquisition, or new CEO hire.\n\nThe following subheads are examples of rationalization.\n\nProduct rationalization is an important part of managing a product\u2019s life cycle. If products are not rationalized, their numbers continue to increase, adding complexity and increased support costs to the company\u2019s bottom line. According to the 80/20 Rule, the bulk of a company\u2019srevenueandprofit(80%) comes from a fraction of its products (20%). Therefore, when rationalizing aproduct line, executives need to consider various factors.\n\nThe portfolio effect describes how a product\u2019s addition or removal affects the rest of the company\u2019s products. Sales may go to other products or be lost completely. Although rationalization may reduce complexity in thesupply chain, as well as redundancy in both the portfolio and support costs, the costs can be difficult to quantify. The portion of sales that will not transfer to other products needs to be estimated and compensated for by new products entering the portfolio or the sales growth of existing products.\n\nIn addition, when products leave the portfolio,fixed coststypically remain the same; the costs must be spread across the remaining product line, increasingunit costs.\n\nProduction volume must be transferred to new or more profitable products to ensure that the business remains solvent. Also, customer migration becomes an issue, as sales and operations managers must create and carry out migration plans. This is especially important with customers buying multiple products who may leave a company that is no longer providing one-stop shopping.\n\nEngaging in applications rationalization, especially duringmergers and acquisitions, helps companies reduce costs, operate more efficiently, and focus on supporting deal objectives, legal and regulatory issues, systems and process integration, and business continuity.\n\nMost businesses accumulate a vast information technology application portfolio over time, especially when companies grow and do not fully integrate operations and assets with each transaction.\n\nMany applications do not support the company\u2019s objectives after each merger or acquisition and need revision to support the new business.\n\nIn terms of market structure, financial models, theories,\u00a0and technologies that embody these concepts have the force to rationalize markets\u2014to make them calculable and more efficient, in terms of theefficient market hypothesis (EMH).\n\nAs more information of various types is able to be processed by information technologies, transmitted and disseminated using communications technology, and incorporated into the market microstructure, prices become more efficient and the market appears more rational.\n\nThe increased use of mathematical formulas and financial models also helps with the rationalization of markets, as they become dissociated with human emotion and fallibility.\n\nRationalization helps companies standardize business processes in order to become more efficient and boost productivity.\n\nIt lets management introduce modern techniques and systems, allowing workers to improve their efficiency levels. In turn, rationalization can lead to better working conditions and higher pay for the workforce, ultimately leading to a higher standard of living in society.\n\nAdditionally, rationalization can translate into both reduced prices and a higher standard of products for consumers.\n\nOn the other hand, rationalization often focuses too much on efficiency at the expense of human capital. The emphasis on modernization and standardization often has negative consequences such as mass layoffs, a loss of initiative from the workforce, a significantly increased workload for the workers that remain, and a worse-off work environment.\n\nMoreover, the process of rationalization is costly, requires consistent monitoring, and provides no guarantee of improved returns.\n\nHelps companies become more efficient and boost productivity\n\nAllows management to implement modernized techniques and systems\n\nCan provide the workforce with better working conditions and higher pay\n\nTranslates into a higher standard of living in society\n\nCan lead to lower prices and better products for consumers\n\nEmphasizes efficiency at the expense of human capital\n\nCan lead to a significantly increased workload for the workers that remain\n\nLoss of initiative from workers due to the mechanization of processes\n\nCostly and requires consistent monitoring\n\nNo guarantee of improved returns\n\nAsset rationalizationis the process of reorganizing a company\u2019s assets in order to increase operating efficiencies and, ultimately, improve its bottom line.\n\nDangers of rationalization include focusing too much on optimization at the expense of human capital, the possibility of negative cultural changes, and allocating capital in an ultimately inefficient manner.\n\nIn economics, rationalization is the process of changing a preexisting workflow into one that\u2019s more goal-oriented and based on a specific set of rules.\n\nRationalization is the reorganization of a company to increase its operating efficiency.
