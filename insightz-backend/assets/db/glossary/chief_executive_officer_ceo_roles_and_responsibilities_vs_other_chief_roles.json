  "term": "Chief Executive Officer (CEO): Roles and Responsibilities vs. Other Chief Roles",
  "definition": "A chief executive officer (CEO) is the highest-ranking executive in a company. A CEO's primary responsibilities include making major corporate decisions, driving the workforce and resources of a company toward strategic goals, and acting as the main point of communication between theboard of directorsand corporate operations. The chief executive officer serves as the public face of the company in many cases.\n\nCEOs are elected by the board and itsshareholders.They report to the chair and the board who are appointed by shareholders.\n\nA CEO\u2019s role varies by company depending on its size, culture, and corporate structure. CEOs in large corporations typically deal only with very high-level strategic decisions and those that direct the company\u2019s overall growth.\n\nCEOs may work on strategy, organization, and culture. They may look at how capital is allocated across the firm or how to build teams to succeed. They can also set the tone, vision, and sometimes the culture of their organizations.\n\nCEOs in smaller companies often are more hands-on and involved with day-to-day functions.\n\nA study from Harvard Business Review analyzed how CEOs spend their time. They found that 72% of CEOs\u2019 working time was spent in meetings. Of the remaining working time, 25% was spent on relationships, 25% on business unit and functional reviews, 21% on strategy, and 16% on culture and organization. The study showed that just 1% of their working time was spent on crisis management, and 3% was allocated to customer relations.\n\nA chief executive officer\u2019s roles and responsibilities also vary greatly between industries and organization sizes. A CEO may generally be expected to take on some or all of these tasks:\n\nCEOs alsoreceive many other benefitsbased on their positions but the total compensation for the highest paid in 2023 was reportedly $161,826,161. The honor went to Hock E. Tan, CEO of Broadcom Inc. This was an increase of 167% from the previous year.\n\nThe chief executive officers of large corporations often achieve fame or infamy because of their frequent dealings with the public. Examples include Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla (TSLA), and Steve Jobs, founder and CEO of Apple (AAPL). Jobs became such a global icon that an explosion of both cinematic and documentary films about him emerged after his death in 2011.\n\nThe leader of an organization may not be titled CEO although they might assume all the typical responsibilities of a CEO.\n\nCorporate America houses numerous titles of senior executives that begin with the letter C for \u201cchief.\u201d This group of top senior staffers has come to be calledC-suiteor C-level in the corporate vernacular.\n\nThe CEO may also be serving as the chief financial officer (CFO) or the chief operating officer (COO) for small organizations or those that are still in thestartupor growth phases. This can lead to a lack of clarity and can overwork an executive. Assigning multiple titles to a single executive-level individual can wreak havoc on a business\u2019s continuity and ultimately affect its long-term profitability.\n\nAssigned titles and the functions associated with each can become muddled quickly when it comes to executive-level positions within an organization.\n\nThe CEO directs the operational aspects of a company. The board of directors oversees the company as a whole and is led by thechair of the board (COB). The chair of the board doesn't have the power to overrule the board but the board has the power to overrule the CEO\u2019s decisions.\n\nThe chair is effectively considered to be a peer of the other board members. The CEO and the chair of the board can be the same person in some cases but many companies split these roles between two people. This gives better governance and oversight of the work of the CEO.\n\nThe CFO is the chief financial officer of a company. CEOs manage general operations. CFOs focus specifically on financial matters.\n\nA CFO analyzes a company\u2019s financial strengths and makes recommendations to improve financial weaknesses. The CFO also trackscash flowand oversees a company\u2019s financial planning such as investments andcapital structures. The CFO seeks to deliver returns to shareholders by focusing on financial discipline and driving margin and revenue growth.\n\nThe chief operating officer (COO) is often ranked second after the CEO. Their responsibilities fall on recruitment, legal, payroll, and training, along with administrative duties as the head ofhuman resources.\n\nSeveral other leadership titles may or may not overlap with a CEO.\n\nThe founder of a company is the individual who started it. They helped bring the company into existence, creating the bylaws andarticles of incorporation, organization structure, and overall strategy from the first day.\n\nA founder can be the title of an individual who's currently with a company or of an individual who started the company but has since left. They can also be considered a founder and may be referred to as both simultaneously, founder/CEO, if they helped to start the company.\n\nA chairperson is a presiding officer who oversees a group or committee. They may also be given the title of \u201cpresident.\u201d They're in charge of managing the group of individuals often assigned a specific task or a set of responsibilities. A board of directors often has a chairperson to oversee the management of the entire board. A CEO may hold a chairperson position if they directly manage a committee.\n\nAn owner is a financial stakeholder of a company, usually with anequityposition in the business. An owner may be entitled to the profits of a company in proportion to their percentage of ownership because companies can have multiple owners. Each individual might be referred to as a part-owner if there's more than one. A CEO can be an owner if they have a financial stake in the company.\n\nThe term \u201cdirector\u201d can refer to a few positions. A director may be upper management or hold an executive-level position depending on a company\u2019s organizational structure. A director may be an individual serving on the board of an organization or a CEO might be a director-level employee. Most companies\u2019 CEOs are on a higher-tier employment level than directors, however. A CEO could also be under the direction of a director.\n\nA CEO often reports to a board of directors who collectively make sure that the company is functioning well.\n\nMarkets can respond either positively or negatively to the change in company leadership during CEO transitions. Studies show that CEOs can have a large impact on a company\u2019s performance. One study found that 45% of company performance is influenced by the CEO.But another showed that CEOs affect just 15% of variance in profitability.\n\nThe price of a company's stockcould changefor any number of reasons when a new CEO takes over. A change in CEO generally carries more downside risk than upside, particularly when it hasn't been planned. A stock\u2019s price could swing up or down based on the market\u2019s perception of the new CEO\u2019s ability to lead the company.\n\nOther factors to consider when investing in a stock that\u2019s undergoing a management change include the incoming CEO\u2019s agenda, whether there might be a shift in corporate strategy, and how well the company\u2019s C-suite is managing the transition phase.\n\nInvestors tend to be more comfortable with new CEOs who are already familiar with the dynamics of the company\u2019s industry and the specific challenges the company might be facing. Investors will typically assess a new CEO\u2019s track record for creating shareholder value. A CEO\u2019s reputation could be reflected in areas like an ability to growmarket share, reduce costs, or expand into new markets.\n\nCEOs are responsible for managing a company. This can include delegating and directing agendas, driving profitability, managing company organizational structure and strategy, and communicating with the board.\n\nIt depends. CEOs are the owners of a company in some cases or are elected by the board of directors in others.\n\nCEO is the highest position to occupy in a company. The CFO is responsible for the financial discipline of a company, identifying its strengths and weaknesses and ultimately reporting to the CEO.\n\nA CEO often reports to a board of directors. The board oversees the performance of the CEO and can elect to remove or replace them if they feel that the executive\u2019s performance isn\u2019t producing the results they want to see.\n\nThe CEO is responsible for making major corporate decisions, driving the direction of the company, supervising other executives, and overseeing growth plans. They're accountable to the board of directors or stakeholders of the company and are often the public face of the organization. CEOs typically have extensive experience in their industry and are tasked with guiding their company toward success and profitability.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \u201cHow CEOs Manage Time.\u201d\n\nEquilar. \"Equilar 100: The 100 Highest-Paid CEOs in 2023.\"\n\nMcKinsey & Company. \u201cThe Mindsets and Practices of Excellent CEOs.\u201d\n\nHarvard Business Review. \u201cWhat Really Works.\"",
