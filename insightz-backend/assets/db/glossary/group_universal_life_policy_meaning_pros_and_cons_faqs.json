  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA group universal\u00a0life policy is a form ofuniversal life insuranceoffered to\u00a0a group of people at a lower cost than what is typically offered to an individual.\u00a0Group universallife insuranceis commonly purchased by corporations that want to provide their employees with life insurance coverage. These policies provide each insured party with permanent insurance coverage with an option to grow their savings.\n\nMany businesses feature group universal life insurance as part of theiremployee benefitspackage. In some cases, coverage may be extended to spouses and other immediate family members of employees as well. Like other policies, group universal life insurance\u00a0pays adeath benefitto the insured party's beneficiaries but also features a savings component\u2014two distinctly different financial benefits.\n\nPolicyholders choose coverage that starts with the amount of their base salary. From there, the amount of coverage depends on the individual's financial situation and the needs of theirbeneficiaries. For instance, someone who earns $50,000 per year may choose a coverage option of $150,000\u2014three times their salary\u2014based on their current situation. This amount is paid to their beneficiaries upon their death as long as thepremiumsare paid.\n\nEmployers may cover the cost of the premiums in their entirety, while others split the cost of coverage with their employees through pre-taxpayroll deductions. The cost of coverage is much less than paying for an individual policy. It's akin to buying food items in bulk. The cost to cover each individual is much cheaper because the policy is designed to cover a large group, just aspurchasing a large amountof a particular grocery item is cheaper on a per-item basis than buying each item separately.\n\nPolicies generally accumulate cash value after about a year\u2014an amount that increases every year thereafter.\u00a0These sums are relegated to a guaranteed account, earning the policyholder a minimum fixed interest rate. Cash value is available forwithdrawalat any time, at any age\u2014 usually without tax penalties. Policyholders\u00a0may choose to leave the savings in the policy and allow the cash value\u00a0to grow.\u00a0Employees can start, change, or stop additional premiums at any time, without charge.\u00a0Policyholders also get the convenience of making contributions via payroll deductions, or they may contribute anylump sumin addition to their premiums.\n\nCash values generally accumulate after a year, grow at a fixed rate, and can be accessed tax-free at any time.\n\nA group universal life\u00a0policy does not receivedividends. Some other types of life insurance may pay dividends. The amount of a dividend is set by a company\u2019sboard of directorseach year and is not guaranteed. When a dividend is payable, a policyholder can take it in cash or use it to purchase more insurance. They may also be used to pay or reduce\u00a0premiums. Earned dividends usually tend to fluctuate from year to year. If you are someone who would like to earn dividends, it's important to review othertypes of life insurance policies.\n\nLife insurance can be expensive and may have many different requirements. Taking group coverage through your employer can be cheaper than taking out an individual policy on your own. You may also be able to get guaranteed coverage without having to answer too many medical questions.\n\nSome employers also provide some other benefits with these policies:\n\nThere are also some distinct disadvantages to group coverage. First, if you don't have portable coverage, you will lose your policy if and when you leave or lose your job. Secondly, because the policy is provided through your employer, you may not be able to get as much coverage as you want and/or need. Keep in mind, if you want to increase the amount of coverage, you're probably going to have to pay more and you'll likely have to take a medical exam.\n\nThis form of permanent life insurance is typically offered by an employer as a benefit to employees. One of the biggest advantages is that the cost is much lower for the customer than if they had purchased the policy on their own.\n\nThese policies come with a cash-savings benefit that earns the policyholder a minimum fixed interest rate. They may be portable, permitting the owner to keep the policy if they change jobs or retire.\n\nThe policy is canceled when you leave or lose your job, unless you have a portability option. Another thing is that since your employer is offering the policy, you may not be able to get as much coverage as you want or need. If you want to increase coverage, you're probably going to have to pay more and get a medical exam.\n\nCorrection\u2014Sept. 15, 2023: This article has been corrected to state that dividends are not paid out on group universal life insurance policies.\n\nMetlife.\"Group Universal Life Insurance.\"\n\nPrudential Group Insurance. \u201cGroup Universal Life Information Guide.\u201d Pages 3-5.\n\nWestern & Southern Financial Group. \u201cWhat Is Group Life Insurance?\u201d\n\nSecurian Financial. \u201cGroup Universal Life Insurance.\u201d",
