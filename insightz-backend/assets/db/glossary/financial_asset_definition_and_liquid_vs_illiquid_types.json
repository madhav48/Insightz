  "term": "Financial Asset Definition and Liquid vs. Illiquid Types",
  "definition": "A financial asset is a non-physical asset that generates income or can be converted to cash.\n\nA financial asset is aliquid assetthat gets its value from a contractual right or ownership claim. Cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and bank deposits are all are examples of financial assets. Unlike land, property, commodities, or other tangible physical assets, financial assets do not necessarily have inherent physical worth or even a physical form. Rather, their value reflects factors of supply and demand in the marketplace in which they trade, as well as the degree of risk they carry.\n\nAssets can be real, financial, orintangible. Real assets are physical, drawing value from substances or properties like precious metals, land, real estate, and commodities like soybeans, wheat, and oil. Intangible assets are valuable but can't be touched. They include patents, trademarks, and intellectual property.\n\nFinancial assets fall between these two classes. They may seem intangible with only the stated value on a piece of paper, such as a dollar bill or a listing on a computer screen. What that paper or listing represents, though, is a claim of ownership of an entity, like apublic company, or contractual rights to payments\u2014say, the interest income from a bond. Financial assets derive their value from a contractual claim on an underlying asset.\n\nThisunderlying assetmay be either real or intangible. For instance, commodities are the underlying assets pinned to such assets as futures contracts or someexchange-traded funds (ETFs). Likewise, real estate\u00a0is the real asset associated with\u00a0shares ofreal estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are financial assets and are publicly traded entities that own a portfolio of properties.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)requires businesses to report financial and real assets together astangible assetsfor tax purposes. The grouping of tangible assets is separate from intangible assets.\n\nAccording to the commonly cited definition from theInternational Financial Reporting Standards\u00a0(IFRS), financial assets include:\n\nIn addition to stocks and receivables, the above definition\u00a0comprises financial derivatives, bonds, money market or other account holdings, and equity stakes.Many of these financial\u00a0assets do not have a set monetary value until they are converted into cash, especially in the case of stocks where their value and price fluctuate.\n\nAside from cash, the more common types of financial assets that investors encounter include:\n\nThe purest form of financial assets is cash and cash equivalents\u2014checking accounts, savings accounts, and money market accounts. Liquid accounts are easily turned into funds for paying bills and covering financial emergencies or pressing demands.\n\nOther varieties of financial assets might not be as liquid.Liquidityis the ability to change a financial asset into cash quickly. For stocks, an investor can buy or sell holdings from a ready market. Liquid markets are those where there are plenty of buyers and plenty of sellers and no extended lag time in trying to execute a trade.\n\nIn the case of equities like stocks and bonds, an investor has to sell and wait for thesettlement dateto receive their money\u2014usually one business day.\n\nMaintaining funds in liquid financial assets can result in greaterpreservation of capital. Money in bank checking, savings, and CD accounts are insured against loss of up to $250,000 by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)and theNational Credit Union Association (NCUA)for credit unions. If the bank fails, your account has coverage up to $250,000. However, since each financial institution is covered individually, an investor with brokered CDs totaling over $250,000 in one bank faces losses if the bank becomes insolvent.\n\nLiquid assets like checking and savings accounts have a limitedreturn on investment (ROI)capability. ROI is the profit you receive from an asset divided by the cost of owning that asset. They may provide modest interest income but, unlike equities, they offer little appreciation. CDs and money market accounts also restrict withdrawals for months or years. When interest rates fall, callable CDs are often called, and investors end up moving their money to potentially lower-income investments.\n\nLiquid financial assets convert into cash easily\n\nSome financial assets have the ability to appreciate in value\n\nFDIC and NCUA insure accounts up to $250,000\n\nHighly liquid financial assets have little appreciation\n\nIlliquid financial assets may be hard to convert to cash\n\nThe value of a financial asset is only as strong as the underlying entity\n\nThe opposite of a liquid asset is anilliquid asset. Real estate and fine antiques are examples of illiquid financial assets. These items have value but cannot convert into cash quickly.\n\nAnother example of an illiquid financial asset are stocks that do not have a high volume of trading on the markets. Often these are investments like penny stocks or high-yield, speculative investments where there may not be a ready buyer when you are ready to sell.\n\nKeeping too much money tied up in illiquid investments has drawbacks\u2014even in ordinary situations. Doing so may result in an individual using a high-interest credit card to cover bills, increasing debt\u00a0and negatively affecting retirement and other investment goals.\n\nBusinesses, as well as individuals, hold financial assets. In the case of an investment or asset management company, the financial assets include the money handled for clients, which is calledassets under management (AUM). For example, BlackRock is the largest investment manager in the world with $11.6 trillion in AUM as of Dec. 31, 2024.\n\nIn the case of banks, financial assets include the worth of the outstanding loans it has made to customers. Capital One, the ninth-largest bank in the U.S., reported over $490 million in total assets as of March 31, 2025.\n\nThis depends. Retirement accounts like 401(k)s are generally considered illiquid assets because they are difficult to convert to cash quickly without incurring a significant loss, especially before you turn 59\u00bd. They do, however, become more liquid after you turn 59\u00bd because you are able to make withdrawals without being penalized.\n\nYour car isn't necessarily considered a liquid asset. That's because it may take you some time to sell it, and you may not get the same price that you paid for it. You may also incur additional costs to sell your vehicle, including advertising, costs to repair, and other potential fees.\n\nCertain assets come with specific ownership rights. For instance, checking and savings accounts allow you to make deposits, withdrawals, and transfers among other transactions. Stock ownership may give the shareholder voting rights and the right to receive dividends while bond ownership allow the holder to receive interest payments and their principal investment when the bond matures.\n\nA financial asset is anything you own that has a value that is derived from a claim of ownership. This value reflects any associated risks along with supply and demand in the market. They are contrasted with liabilities, which refer to money that you owe. Financial assets support economic growth and the creation of wealth and also help individuals achieve and preserve their financial goals.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 551, Basis of Assets.\" Pages 2-4.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. \"IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation.\" Pages 1351-1353.\n\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards Foundation. \"IAS 32: Financial Instruments: Presentation.\" Pages 1353-1358.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"New 'T+1' Settlement Cycle \u2013 What Investors Need to Know: Investor Bulletin.\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Deposit Insurance FAQs.\"\n\nBlackRock. \"BlackRock Reports First Quarter 2025 Diluted EPS of $9.64, or $11.30 as adjusted,\" Page 4.\n\nFederal Reserve Statistics. \"Large Commercial Banks.\"",
