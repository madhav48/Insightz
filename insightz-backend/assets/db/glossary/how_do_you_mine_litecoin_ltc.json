  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nLitecoin mining is the process of validating transactions in the Litecoin blockchain, closing the block, opening a new one, and receiving a reward. Litecoin uses proof-of-work in its consensus design, which employs computational power to solve a cryptographic puzzle.Litecoin is rewarded to the miner who generates a solution that is equal to or less than the network target.\n\nLike Bitcoin, it can be mined on computers using central and graphics processing units. It is less profitable but also less competitive than purchasing anapplication-specific integrated circuit(ASIC) and joining a mining pool.\n\nLitecoin mining is very similar to Bitcoin mining in its essentials.\n\nA cryptocurrency mining program runs on a machine, computer, or device. Mining is described as a complicated mathematical process. However, the mining software generates a hash from the information in a proposed block and appends a number to it called the nonce (number used once) and hashes it.\n\nAs a hexadecimal number, this hash has a value. This value must be equal to or less than the target hash\u2014a hexadecimal value set by the mining network that creates the mining difficulty level. If the hash is more than the target, the nonce is increased by a value of one, then it is hashed again. The entire network does this until a miner guesses a value that meets the criteria.\n\nThe first miner to guess a hexadecimal value smaller than the target hash set by the blockchain protocol wins a reward of 6.25 Litecoin.\n\nThe reward is cut in half every four years\u2014this is called a halving and occurs every 840,000 blocks. (Bitcoin's is every 240,000 blocks.)\n\nLitecoin's next halving is expected to happen sometime in mid-2027, and the reward will be reduced to 3.125 LTC. This will continue until all 84 million LTC are in circulation, which is expected to occur in 2142.\n\nTo get started, you will need to invest in hardware and software to run the mining process itself.\n\nThe state of the Litecoin mining network is such that a solo miner with one ASIC stands a very limited chance of receiving rewards. You can join a mining pool with one of these setups, but your rewards are likely to be much smaller, as pools usually use a payout scheme where you receive a payout proportional to the amount of work you contribute.\n\nAfter purchasing your mining equipment, you'll need to choose a mining pool to mine with, set the miner up using the pool's instructions\u2014usually posted on the pool's website\u2014and begin mining following the instructions for your machine, software, and pool.\n\nYou'll also need to choose a wallet in which to store your private keys. Many are available, with names including Exodus, Electrum, and Mycelium.\n\nThere are several factors to consider while looking into mining hardware or software for Litecoin:\n\nMost importantly, you'll need to identify your goals for mining Litecoin. For example, you might want to mine for some extra spending money. Or, you might want toholdthe Litecoin you receive, hoping for growth in its value. Whatever your reasons, you'll need to make sure that you can get the returns you want before investing in expensive hardware.\n\nMining pools generally list current ASIC mining costs and revenue. The Antminer L7 is one of the most profitable Litecoin miners, but with a price tag of close to $4,000, it could take a few years to recoup the purchase cost, depending on the pool you join and the energy you use.\n\nThe amount you spend will dictate how productive and profitable you are as a miner.\n\nIn a pool, your rewards are based on your contributions to the work done. The Litecoin Miner L7 can mine at 9.5 GH/s (gigahashes per second, or 9.5 billion hashes per second), while a CPU generally mines in thousands of hashes per second (KH/s).A Litecoin mining pool can produce hundreds of trillions of hashes per second.\n\nThe mining pool F2Pool mined Litcoin at a hash rate of 141.19 TH/s (tera hashes per second) on June 7, 2025. Even with the L7, your share of one reward might be only a few dollars.\n\nFor example, on May 1, 2024, the L7 averaged a 24-hour payout of $17.49 (which included a Dogecoin payout) before accounting for energy use and how long it might take to pay off the mining rig. There are more profitable ASICs, but they are cost-prohibitive for smaller miners.\n\nYou should consider theamount of energyused by an ASIC miner. The Antminer L7 uses approximately $10 per day in energy. Your energy bill would increase by more than $3,800 per year (at $0.13 per kW/h), further reducing your yearly profits.\n\nThis cost represents only the energy used to power the miner. ASICs produce a lot of heat while they run\u2014to be most profitable, they need to run 24 hours a day. An ASIC will run up your cooling bill unless you can find a way to vent the heat outside your home.\n\nHashrate is another crucial consideration. The faster your ASIC canhash, the more competitive you'll be on your own or in a pool. Many mining pools split the cryptocurrency they're rewarded, but most base individual rewards on the amount of work done per miner.\n\nIf you have a slow ASIC, your profits will likely be much less than a miner with a faster mining rig or setup.\n\nOnce you've decided what equipment you'll use to mine, you need to determine how to mine:\u00a0solo or in a pool. Mining alone, you\u00a0risk going long periods without finding a block. However, if you're lucky enough to mine a block solo, you'll keep the entire 6.25 LTC\u00a0plus fees.\n\nPool mining, in which many miners combine and distribute the proceeds according to the hashing power contributed,\u00a0is still subject to luck: your pool might open three blocks out of 10, then wait for 200 blocks to open another one.\n\nYour earnings are almost certain to be steadier with a pool. The tradeoff is that you only earn a small cut of each block the pool finds.\n\nLitecoin is not as popular as Bitcoin, but it is still mineable. It is updated when needed and had a 24-hour trading volume of more than $383 million on June 18, 2025.\n\nLitecoin is one of the oldest cryptocurrencies. While it's risky to say whether any cryptocurrency has a future, Litecoin keeps getting older.\n\nA lot can happen in five years, so it's impossible to predict what a cryptocurrency's price will be. A Litecoin was worth $86.17 as of May 15, 2025. Over the previous year, its price ranged from about $55 to about $135.\n\nLitecoin is a cryptocurrency known for volatility and unpredictability. If you enjoy speculating and exciting markets, Litecoin might be a worthy investment. If you're looking for a safe place to grow capital, look elsewhere.\n\nLitecoin can be mined using personal computers and GPUs, but these units are much slower than ASICs. Litecoin mining is much quicker than mining Bitcoin\u2014but even with the faster processing times, the chances of successfully mining Litecoin on your own are very low.\n\nThe rewards also are lower than with other coins because LTC's market value is significantly lower. You'll have to figure out if mining Litecoin will be rewarding enough to justify the expenditures and whether you might be more profitable mining another coin.\n\nRegardless, it's important to join a mining pool to increase your chances of success.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
