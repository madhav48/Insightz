  "definition": "Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nAn accounting ratio is an analysis tool used to evaluate a company's financial health by measuring the relationship between two figures from its financial statements.\n\nAccounting ratios, an important subset of financial ratios, are a group of metrics used to measure the\u00a0management aptitude, efficiency, andprofitabilityof a company based on its financial reports.\u00a0They provide a way of expressing the relationship between one accounting data point to another and are the basis ofratio analysis. They also serve as a way to compare the firm's performance to its competitors.\n\nAn accounting ratio compares two line items in a company\u2019sfinancial statements. These consist of its income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. The ratios can be used to evaluate a company\u2019sfundamentalsand provide information about the performance of the company over the last quarter or fiscal year.\n\nAnalyzing accounting ratios is an important step in determining the financial health of a company. They can often point out areas that are dragging the profitability of a company down and therefore need improvement. The effectiveness of new management plans, new products, and changes in operational procedures can all be determined by analyzing accounting ratios.\n\nAccounting ratios also work as an important comparison tool. The company and its investors can see how it stacks up against its competitors.\n\nA thorough accounting analysis can be a complex task. Calculating an accounting ratio, on the other hand, is a simple process of dividing two line items found on a financial statement.\n\nTheincome statementcontains information about a company's sales, expenses, and net income. It also provides an overview of earnings and the number ofshares outstandingused to calculateearnings per share(EPS). These are some of the most popular data points that analysts use to assess a company\u2019s profitability.\n\nGross profitas a percent of sales is referred to asgross margin. It's calculated by dividing gross profit by sales. If gross profit is $80,000 and sales are $100,000, the gross profit margin would be 80%. The higher the gross profit margin, the better. It indicates that a company is keeping a higher proportion ofrevenuesas profit rather than using them to meet expenses.\n\nOperating profitas a percentage of sales is referred to asoperating margin. It's calculated by dividing operating profit by sales. If the operating profit is $60,000 and sales are $100,000, the operating profit margin would be 60%.\n\nThebalance sheetprovides you with a snapshot of a company\u2019s capital structure. One of the most important measures of capital structure is thedebt-to-equity(D/E) ratio.\n\nIt's calculated by dividing debt byequity. If a company has debt equal to $100,000 and equity equal to $50,000, the debt-to-equity ratio would be two to one. The debt-to-equity ratio shows how much a business is leveraged\u2014that is, how much debt it's using to finance operations rather than its internal funds.\n\nThequick ratiois also known as theacid-test ratio. It's an indicator of a company\u2019s short-termliquidityand measures a company\u2019s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets. The ratio excludes inventories from current assets because we're only concerned with the most liquid assets in this case.\n\nThecash flow statementprovides data for ratios dealing with cash. Thedividend payout ratiois the percentage of net income paid out to investors throughdividends. Both dividends andshare repurchasesare considered outlays of cash and can be found on the cash flow statement.\n\nIf dividends are $100,000 and income is $400,000, the dividend payout ratio is calculated by dividing $100,000 by $400,000, which works out to 25%. The higher the dividend payout ratio, the higher the percentage of income a company pays out as dividends rather than reinvesting back into the company.\n\nShares outstanding are those that are available to investors. They include shares held by company employees and institutional investors. The number can fluctuate when employees exercise stock options or if the company issues more shares.\n\nLiquid assets include cash and anything that can be easily converted to cash. They include marketable securities, government bonds, foreign currencies, and treasury bills.\n\nAccounting ratios provide a view of a company's financial health. However, they're only one type of tool when you're assessing investments. They can measure a company's liquidity and profitability, but this information should be taken in light of other factors to get a complete picture of a company's sustainability and potential earnings.\n\nAccounting ratios can provide an accurate assessment of the profitability of a company over the last quarter or fiscal year. They include the debt-to-equity ratio, the quick ratio, the dividend payout ratio, the gross margin, and the operating margin.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many accounting tools that corporations and analysts use to evaluate a company; however. Many other tools highlight different aspects of a company, so you\u2019ll want to explore and potentially use them as well.",
