Eisenhower signed legislation that created a new approach to income-producing real estate investment. The move would help smaller investors take advantage of investing in the real estatemarketsomething that was generally only available for large, commercial entities. The National Association of Real Estate wasincorporatedthe next day as a way to represent REITs and real estate-based investment companies.\n\nThe organization was known in the industry as NAREIT until 2017 when it wasrebrandedas Nareit. The organization said it rebranded to reflect changes within the industry, notably \"a new era for our industry defined by the introduction of the new GICS Real Estate Sector and the growth and globalization of the industry.\" According to Nareit, changing itsbrand identityallowed it to educate the investment industry about REITs.\n\nREITs can be a good investment depending on the investor's individual goals and tolerance for risk. REITs, for many, can be a good way to invest in the real estate industry while remaining liquid and without the overhead of the classic real estate investment: the home purchase. REITs typically pay substantial dividends but can fluctuate in prices rapidly.\n\nThere is no average return measurement for REITs primarily because they operate in different sectors. For example, a REIT with broad exposure to all commercial real estate may fare better if there was a dip in mortgage income. In this scenario, a broader REIT would outperform a REIT invested in residential mortgages.\n\nA REIT can perform well during a recession if it invests in real estate holdings that are not affected by the market downturn. Some areas of real estate can outperform the general market during a recession. But REITs would underperform compared to a market index (such as the S&P500) if a recession hit the real estate sector particularly hard.\n\nREITs can be better than stocks in some ways, and less attractive in others. Investors typically don't choose one or the other. Instead, they often opt for a combination of both and consider their REIT exposure their exposure to the real estate market without thinking about the general equities market. Although they are traded on the same exchanges, REITs serve different purposes, and a REIT is closer to an exchange traded fund (ETF) than an individual company's stock.\n\nSome of the disadvantages of a REIT are high expense ratios, lack of investor input, and lack of owner-initiated property enhancement. Investors trade the higher liquidity of a REIT with owning a property outright. But that investor can't make enhancements, such as adding a new roof or electrical to enhance the property's value. REITs themselves can sometimes suffer from a lack of market liquidity, but those issues tend to be reserved for smaller REITs that are not heavily traded.\n\nNareit. \"Nareit Leadership Team.\"\n\nNareit. \"Committees, Subcommittees and Councils.\"\n\nNareit. \"History of REITs & Real Estate Investing.\"\n\nNareit. \"REIT Industry Timeline.\"",
