  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nDebt-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) is a ratio that measures the amount of income generated and available to pay downdebtbefore a company accounts for interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization expenses. A high ratio result could indicate a company has adebt loadthat might be too high.\n\nBanks often include a certain debt-to-EBITDA target in the covenants for business loans, and a company must maintain this agreed-upon level or risk having the entire loan become due immediately. Credit rating agencies commonly use this metric to assess a company's probability of defaulting on issued debt. Firms with a high debt-to-EBITDA ratio may not be able to service their debt appropriately, leading to a loweredcredit rating.\n\nDebt\u00a0to\u00a0EBITDA=DebtEBITDA\\text{Debt to EBITDA}= \\frac{\\text{Debt}}{\\text{EBITDA}}Debt\u00a0to\u00a0EBITDA=EBITDADebt\u200b\n\nDebt =Long-term and short-term debt obligations\n\nEBITDA= Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization\n\nTo determine total debt, add the company's long-term and short-term debt obligations. You can find these numbers in the company's balance sheet in the \"Liabilities\" section.\n\nYou can calculate EBITDA using data from the company's income statement. Find its net income on the income statement, then add any interest expenses, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. Divide the debt by the company's EBITDA.\n\nThe debt-to-EBITDA ratio is similar to thenet debt-to-EBITDA ratio. The main difference is the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio subtracts cash and cash equivalents while the standard ratio does not.\n\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measurement. If you learn a company is using it in its reports, you should investigate further to learn more about their debt and actual earnings or income.\n\nThe debt-to-EBITDA ratio compares a company'stotal obligationsto the actual cash the company brings in from its operations. It reveals how capable the firm is of paying its debt and other liabilities if taxes and the expenses from depreciation and amortization are deferred.\n\nThe ratio can also be used to compare companies without considering their financing methods and non-cash assets. This is useful because it provides a clearer picture of how debts can be paid.\n\nA declining debt-to-EBITDA ratio is better than an increasing one because it implies the company is paying off its debt and/or growing earnings. Likewise, an increasing debt-to-EBITDA ratio means the company isincreasing debtmore than earnings.\n\nSome analysts like the debt-to-EBITDA ratio because it is easy to calculate. Debt can be found on the balance sheet, and EBITDA can be calculated from theincome statement. The issue, however, is that it may not provide the most accurate measure of earnings. In fact, companies often use EBITDA to hide or disguise losses over a period.\n\nDepreciation and amortization are non-cash expenses that do not really impact cash flows, but interest on debt can be a significant expense for some companies. Banks and investors looking at the debt-to-EBITDA ratio to gain insight into how well the company can pay its debts may want to consider the impact of interest on debt-repayment ability, even if that debt will be included in new issuance.\n\nSome industries are more capital-intensive than others, so a company's debt-to-EBITDA ratio should only be compared to the same ratio for other companies in the same industry. In some industries, a debt-to-EBITDA of 10 could be completely normal, while a ratio of three to four is more appropriate in other industries.\n\nAs an example, if company A has $100 million in debt and $10 million in EBITDA, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio is 10. If company A pays off 50% of that debt in the next five years while increasing EBITDA to $25 million, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio falls to two.\n\nIt depends on the industry in which the company operates. Anything above 1.0 means the company has more debt than earnings before accounting for income tax, depreciation, and amortization. Some industries might require more debt, while others might not. Before considering this ratio, it helps to determine the industry's average.\n\nDebt-to-equity measures how much debt a company has to its shareholders' equity. Because shareholders' equity is part of total liabilities, it shows how much of a business's debt is equity financing. Lower ratios are ideal, but \"good\" depends on a business's financial structure and how other companies in the same industry structure themselves.\n\nIt depends on the business and the industry it operates in. Some analysts might say 3.0 is the limit, while others might go as high as, or higher than, 4.5 or 5.0.\n\nThe debt-to-EBITDA ratio tells you how much income is available to pay debts before taxes, depreciation, and amortization are considered. The ratio is used by some analysts, but since certain expenses are not accounted for before the calculation, the metric is limited because it doesn't demonstrate the ability to pay debts from earnings after all expenses are paid.",
