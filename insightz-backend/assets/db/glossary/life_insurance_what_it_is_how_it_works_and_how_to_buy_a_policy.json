  "term": "Life Insurance: What It Is, How It Works, and How to Buy a Policy",
  "definition": "Life insurance acts as a financial safety net for your family. If you die while it\u2019s active, your insurance company pays a sum of money to the people you\u2019ve named in your policy. This money, known as the death benefit, can help your beneficiaries replace your lost income and cover expenses like housing, food, and utility bills. Life insurance can be used to pay for funeral expenses, cover outstanding debts, or leave a legacy for loved ones or charitable organizations.\n\nLife insurance can seem complicated, but understanding how it works, who\u2019s involved, and everyone\u2019s responsibilities can help you make informed decisions about your coverage, whether you\u2019re new to life insurance or looking to switch policies or insurers.\n\nThepolicyholderis the person who owns the life insurance policy and is responsible for paying the premiums. The policy usually insures the policyholder, but you can also purchase and manage a policy on behalf of someone else. For example, a business owner might buy a policy on behalf of a high-performing employee, making the company both policyholder and recipient of the death benefit. Similarly, you can take out a policy for a loved one, like a spouse, while acting as the designated policy owner.\n\nYou can\u2019t buy life insurance for whoever you want. Insurance companies require you to have aninsurable interest, meaning you\u2019d face financial hardship if that person died.\n\nThebeneficiaryis the designated person or entity that will receive the death benefit. A life insurance policy can have multiple beneficiaries, such as family members, friends, or even organizations like charities.\n\nPremiums are theregular paymentsyou make to your insurance company to keep the policy active. They are based on factors like age, health, lifestyle, and the amount of coverage you need. For example, a 30-year-old in good health should have significantly lower premiums than a 50-year-old smoker with a history of health issues. The type of policy also matters: Temporary term insurance costs much less than permanent insurance.\n\nThedeath benefitis the money your loved ones receive when you die. When submitting a life insurance claim, they can usually choose how they want to receive the money:\n\nThe death benefit can be used for any purpose, such as paying off a mortgage, covering funeral expenses, or funding a child\u2019s education. It\u2019s also generallytax-free, making it a highly valuable and hassle-free financial resource for beneficiaries.\n\nTo receive the death benefit, your beneficiaries need to file a claim with the insurance company. To initiate the process, they\u2019ll need copies of the death certificate (including a certified copy from the funeral director), the insurance policy, and any other required forms. The insurer will then review the claim. If everything checks out, the company will pay the death benefit to your beneficiaries, usuallywithin 30 daysof when the claim was first submitted.\n\nThere are two main types of life insurance:term life insurance, which provides coverage for a specific period, and permanent life insurance, which covers you for your entire life and often comes with a savings or investment component.\n\nTerm life insurance covers you for a specific period\u2014such as 10, 20, or 30 years. Once the period is over, you stop paying premiums and your policy expires. Because of this time limit, term life insurance is generally the most affordable option, making it ideal for anyone looking for low-cost coverage for a specific timeframe.\n\nFor example, if you\u2019re planning a family, you might consider a 20- or 30-year term policy to ensure your children are supported financially, at least through college graduation. Your premiums stay the same during the entire term. However, the longer the term you pick, the more expensive the initial premiums because you lock in the cost for more time.\n\nWithpermanent life insurance, such as whole life or universal life, you pay policy premiums your entire life rather than a set number of years, providing you and your family with lifelong financial protection (or for as long as you pay premiums). Similar to term life, permanent life policies also pay out a death benefit to your beneficiaries. Permanent life insurance also usually comes with acash valuecomponent that can earn interest and grow over time as you continue paying premiums.\n\nA policy\u2019s cash value component can increase your loved one\u2019s benefit amount and, in some cases, can pay you a dividend\u2014financial compensation based on the insurance company\u2019s financial performance. You can also withdraw money from the cash value or take out a loan using it as collateral.\n\nAny money you withdraw or borrow from your cash value reduces the amount your beneficiaries receive when you die. If you withdraw too much or fail to repay a loan, your policy could lapse, which would end your coverage.\n\nHere are some common types of permanent life insurance:\n\nRiders are extra features you can add to your life insurance policy to better suit your needs. Here are some of the most common types of life insurance riders:\n\nWhile the above riders can enhance your policy\u2019s flexibility, they usually come at an additional cost.
