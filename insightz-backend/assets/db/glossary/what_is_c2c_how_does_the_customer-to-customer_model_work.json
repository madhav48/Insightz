  "definition": "Customer to customer (C2C) is abusiness modelwhereby customers can trade with each other, typically in an online environment.\n\nTwo implementations of C2C markets are auctions and classified advertisements. C2C marketing has soared in popularity with the arrival of the internet and\u00a0companies such aseBay, Etsy, and Craigslist.\n\nC2C represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform tofacilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a type of business model that emerged withecommercetechnology and thesharing economy.\n\nCustomers benefit from the competition for products and often find items that are\u00a0difficult to locate elsewhere. Also,marginscan be higher than traditional pricing methods for sellers because there are minimal costs due to the absence of retailers or wholesalers. C2C sites are convenient because there is no need to visit abrick-and-mortarstore. Sellers list their products online, and the buyers come to them.\n\nTheAmazon effectis named after the popular global online retailer and refers to the competitive gains that ecommerce businesses have made as more shoppers make purchases online instead of at brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nCraigslistis an ecommerce platform that connects people advertising products, services, or situations. Craigslist not only provides a platform for buying, selling, and trading products but also posts monthly classified ads, such as employment opportunities and property listings. This platform requires the seller to deliver items directly to the buyer in person.\n\nEtsyallows company owners to create their custom website on which to market their products to consumers. The C2C site offers guidance and tools for growing a business that ranges in price according to a company\u2019s stage of development.There\u2019s also an Etsy Seller app that helps to manage orders, listings, and customer queries efficiently.\n\neBay features two types of product listings: fixed-price items and auction items. Fixed-price items can be purchased quickly by selecting the Buy It Now button. Auction items feature a Place Bid button for entering bids and show a currentbid price. These items are open to bids for a predetermined time and are declared \u201csold\u201d to the highest bidder.\n\nC2C websites and similar platforms make money from fees charged to sellers for listing items for sale, adding on promotional features, and facilitating credit card transactions. These C2C transactions\u00a0typically\u00a0involve used products sold through a classified orauctionsystem.\n\nThe C2C market is projected to grow in the future because of its cost-effectiveness. The cost of usingthird partiesis declining, and the number of products for sale by consumers is steadily rising. Retailers consider it to be an\u00a0essential business model because of\u00a0the popularity ofsocial mediaand other online channels. These channels showcase specific products already owned by consumers and increase demand, which drives increased online traffic to C2C platforms.\n\nHowever, C2C has problems such as a lack ofquality controlor payment guarantees. In some cases,\u00a0there is little support for credit card transactions, although the emergence ofPayPaland other such payment systems over the years has helped simplify payments on C2C platforms.\n\nThe C2C marketplace has increased over time, as more companies have entered the space to facilitate C2C transactions. Many companiestarget niche marketsand\u00a0list specific products to\u00a0attract unique consumers.\n\nThe C2C marketplace is increasing in popularity among sellers looking to maximize their sales potential by connecting with customers who they otherwise would not reach using traditional selling methods.\n\nOnline platforms such as Etsy, eBay, and Craigslist appeal to customers who can locate almost any product or service at a price they are willing to pay.\n\nHowever, despite the increasing popularity of the C2C marketplace, some companies have issues. These include a lack of quality control and payment guarantees. For example, some C2C e-commerce sellers have complained of being scammed by customers, and Craigslist is mostly unmoderated.\n\nIn ecommerce, some big names in C2C include eBay, Etsy, Craigslist, Ali Express, and Amazon Marketplace. Some C2C payment companies include Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle.\n\nC2C stands for customer to customer; P2P stands forpeer to peer. Both concepts involve consumers or individuals dealing with one another. The main difference is that with C2C, there is a company or other third party between the buyer and the seller (or sender and receiver). In a P2P platform, counterparties transact directly with one another without that intermediary.\n\nMost companies are B2C (business to consumer). This means that a business produces and markets a product for household consumption. This differs from B2B (business to business) or C2C (customer to customer).\n\nIn the customer-to-customer (C2C) business model, customers trade directly with each other\u2014typically online. Auctions and classified ads are two versions of C2C markets, and companies like Craiglist, eBay, and Etsy\u2014and the internet in general\u2014have helped C2C marketing soar in popularity.\n\nEtsy Help Center. \u201cHow to Use the Etsy Seller App.\u201d\n\neBay. \u201cHow Buying Works on eBay.\u201d",
