  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) measures how many days it takes a company to pay its obligations.\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is a financial ratio that indicates the average time (in days) that a company takes to pay its bills and invoices to its trade creditors, which may include suppliers, vendors, or financiers. The ratio is typically calculated on a quarterly or annual basis, and it indicates how well the company\u2019s cash outflows are being managed.\n\nA company with a higher value of DPO takes longer to pay its bills, which means that it can retain available funds for a longer duration, allowing the company an opportunity to use those funds in a better way to maximize the benefits. A high DPO, however, may also be a red flag that indicates an inability to pay its bills on time.\n\n\ufeffDPO=Accounts\u00a0Payable\u00d7Number\u00a0of\u00a0DaysCOGSwhere:COGS=Cost\u00a0of\u00a0Goods\u00a0Sold=Beginning\u00a0Inventory+P\u2212Ending\u00a0Inventory\\begin{aligned} &\\text{DPO} = \\frac{\\text{Accounts Payable}\\times\\text{Number of Days}}{\\text{COGS}}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{COGS}=\\text{Cost of Goods Sold} \\\\ &\\qquad\\ \\ \\, \\,= \\text{Beginning Inventory} + \\text{P} -\\text{Ending Inventory}\\\\ &\\text{P}=\\text{Purchases} \\end{aligned}\u200bDPO=COGSAccounts\u00a0Payable\u00d7Number\u00a0of\u00a0Days\u200bwhere:COGS=Cost\u00a0of\u00a0Goods\u00a0Sold=Beginning\u00a0Inventory+P\u2212Ending\u00a0Inventory\u200b\ufeff\n\nAccounts payable (AP)represents how much money the company owes to its supplier(s) for purchases made on credit.\n\nAdditionally, there is thecost of goods sold (COGS), which is defined as the cost of acquiring or manufacturing the products that a company sells during a period. This may include payment for utilities and employee wages.\n\nBoth of these figures represent cash outflows and are used in calculating DPO over a period of time.\n\nThe number of days in the corresponding period is usually taken as 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter. The formula takes account of the average per day cost being borne by the company for manufacturing a product. The numerator figure represents payments outstanding. The net factor gives the average number of days taken by the company to pay off its obligations after receiving the bills.\n\nTwo different versions of the DPO formula are used depending upon the accounting practices. In one of the versions, the accounts payable amount is taken as the figure reported at the end of the accounting period, like \u201cat the end of fiscal year/quarter ending September 30.\u201d This version represents the DPO value as of the mentioned date.\n\nIn another version, the average value of beginning AP and ending AP is taken, and the resulting figure represents the DPO value during that particular period.\n\nCOGS remains the same in both versions.\n\nDPO is a turnover ratio that measures the efficiency of a company.\n\nGenerally, a company acquires inventory, utilities, and other necessary services on credit. It results in\u00a0accounts payable, a key accounting entry that represents a company's obligation to pay off the short-term liabilities to its creditors or suppliers. Beyond the actual dollar amount to be paid, the timing of the payments\u2014from the date of receiving the bill till the cash actually going out of the company\u2019s account\u2014also becomes an important aspect of the business. DPO attempts to measure this average time cycle for outward payments and is calculated by taking the standard accounting figures into consideration over a specified period of time.\n\nAdditionally, a company may need to balance its outflow tenure with that of the inflow. Imagine if a company allows a 90-day period for its customers to pay for the goods they purchase but has only a 30-day window to pay its suppliers and vendors. This mismatch will result in the company being prone to cash crunch frequently. Companies must strike a delicate balance with DPO.\n\nCompanies having high DPO can use the available cash for short-term investments and to increase theirworking capitalandfree cash flow (FCF).\n\nHowever, higher values of DPO may not always be a positive for the business. If the company takes too long to pay its creditors, it risks jeopardizing its relations with the suppliers and creditors who may refuse to offer the trade credit in the future or may offer it on terms that may be less favorable to the company. The company may also be losing out on any discounts on timely payments, if available, and it may be paying more than necessary.\n\nA low DPO indicates that a company is paying its bills to suppliers quickly, which may suggest that the company is managing its cash flow effectively. A low DPO is considered to be a positive sign for a company's financial health, as it shows that the company is able to pay its bills in a timely manner. This also helps maintain good relationship with suppliers.\n\nHowever, a low DPO may also indicate that the company is not taking advantage of the time to earn interest on its funds. For example, a company may be extended a payment period of 30 days. If it usually pays invoices after 10 days, the company could have been earning interest on the funds for an additional 20 days before remitting payment.\n\nA high DPO can indicate that a company is using capital resourcefully, but it can also show that the company is struggling to pay its creditors.\n\nDepending on various global and local factors, like the overall performance of the economy, region, and sector, plus any applicable seasonal impacts, the DPO value of a particular company can vary significantly from year to year, company to company, and industry to industry.\n\nBecause typical DPO values vary so widely across different industry sectors, analysts only compare DPO among firms of a particular sector. A firm's management can compare its DPO to the average within its industry to see if it is paying its vendors too quickly or too slowly.\n\nDPO value also forms an integral part of the formula used for calculating thecash conversion\u00a0cycle (CCC),\u00a0another key metric that expresses the length of time that a company takes to convert the resource inputs into realized cash flows from sales. While DPO focuses on\u00a0the current outstanding payable by the business, the superset CCC follows the entire cash time-cycle as the cash is first converted into\u00a0inventory, expenses, and\u00a0accounts payable,\u00a0through to sales and\u00a0accounts receivable, and then back into cash in hand when received.\n\nCompanies often want a high DPO as long as it doesn't indicate an inability to make payments. To achieve this, a company can negotiate with its suppliers to extend payment terms. If a company really prioritizes maximizing its DPO, it can decline to take advantage of early payment discounts.\n\nBy using electronic payment systems, a company can streamline its payment processes and make payments more quickly and efficiently. This means that instead of issuing slower means of payment such as a check that may have to be processed and mailed early in order for it to be received in time, a company can issue electronic payments the instant something is due.\n\nIf a company wants to decrease its DPO, it can regularly monitor its accounts payable to identify and resolve any issues that may be delaying payment to suppliers. A company can also more quickly resolve supplier payment problems if it has accurate and up-to-date records.\n\nDPO may be most valuable when compared over time, as a company can see whether its DPO is improving or worsening and make the appropriate course of action accordingly.\n\nA company can use DPO to understand its financial flexibility. By evaluating its DPO, it can project its creditworthiness,liquidity, and financial health. When a company's DPO is high, this may either mean the company is struggling to pay bills on time or is effectively using credit terms. Only by measuring DPO can a company further evaluate.\n\nWhen a company knows its DPO, it can better assess whether it is paying its bills quickly, which helps maintain good relationships with suppliers. A company usually wants to balance the benefit of paying a vendor early against thepurchasing powerlost by spending capital early. In many cases, a company may want to stay in the good graces of a supplier in order to potentially receive goods earlier.\n\nWhile DPO is useful in comparing relative strength among companies, there is no clear-cut figure for what constitutes\u00a0a healthy days payable outstanding, as the DPO varies significantly by industry, competitive positioning of the company, and its bargaining power. Large companies with a strong power of negotiation are able to contract for better terms with suppliers and creditors.\n\nIn addition, the figure by itself doesn't mean much. For example, a company may be thinking that its DPO means it is efficiently using capital. On the contrary, the company may actually be paying vendors late and racking up late fees.\n\nCan be used to gauge the financial health of a company\n\nIs often the first step in knowing a company's liquidity and potential cash constraints\n\nIs useful in measuring a company's relationship with suppliers\n\nNo clear cut figure for what is good or bad\n\nUsually changes based on the size of company and purchasing power\n\nOften requires further research to understand\n\nThe snippets below are taken from Amazon's consolidated statement of operations for thefiscal yearthat ended on December 31, 2024.\n\nAmazon reports its accounts payable balance on itsbalance sheet. For 2024, the average balance of accounts payable was $94,363 million.\n\nFor the COGS, the company directly reports that as cost of sales. For 2024, Amazon's cost of goods sold was $326,288 billion.\n\nTherefore, DPO can be calculated as: ($94.4 billion/$326.3 billion) * 365 days. So Amazon's DPO is approximately 106 days. This DPO calculation demonstrates Amazon's ability to leverage its size to enter into contracts where it has long, open periods where it's not expected to pay aninvoice.\n\nAs a financial ratio, days payable outstanding (DPO) shows the amount of time that companies take to pay financiers,creditors, vendors, or suppliers. The DPO may indicate a few things, namely, how a company is managing its cash, or the means for a company to utilize this cash towards short-term investments that in turn may amplify their cash flow. The DPO is measured on a quarterly or annual term.\n\nTo calculate days payable outstanding (DPO), the following formula is applied: DPO = Accounts Payable x Number of Days/Cost of Goods Sold (COGS). Here, COGS refers to beginning inventory plus purchases subtracting the ending inventory. Accounts payable refers to company purchases that were made on credit that are due to its suppliers.\n\nDays payable outstanding (DPO) is the average amount of time that it takes for a company to pay its bills. By contrast, days sales outstanding (DSO) is the average amount of time for sales to be paid back to the company. When a DSO is high, it indicates that the company is waiting extended periods to collect money for products that it sold on credit. By contrast, a high DPO could be interpreted multiple ways, either indicating that the company is utilizing its cash on hand to create more working capital, or indicating poor management of free cash flow.\n\nDays payable outstanding, or DPO, is one of several metrics used to gauge the financial health of a company. It's a ratio that computes the average number of days a company takes to pay its obligations.\n\nThere's no single standard for a \"good\" DPO value. A high DPO can be a positive sign that a company is using its capital resourcefully, but if it's too high, it may be struggling to make payments. Conversely, a low DPO could mean that a company pays its bills quickly, but it may also be missing out on potential interest by holding cash longer.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. \"Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024.\" Page 39.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. \"Annual Report for the Fiscal Year Ended Dec. 31, 2024.\" Page 37.",
