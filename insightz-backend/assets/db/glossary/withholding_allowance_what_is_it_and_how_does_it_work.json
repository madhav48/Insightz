  "term": "Withholding Allowance: What Is It, and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "A withholding allowance is an exemption that reduces how much income an employer deducts from an employee\u2019s paycheck for taxes and transmits to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on their behalf.\n\nThis exemption from withholding is tied to the personal exemption, a federal tax break that was available to all taxpayers, regardless of their expenses, through 2017.\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 eliminatedpersonal exemptionsfor the period from 2018 to 2025. As a result, the withholding allowance has no current practical relevance. But that could change after 2025, if the TCJA changes are not extended.\n\nFor now, it is no longer part ofForm W-4: Employee\u2019s Withholding Certificate, which the IRS completely redesigned.\n\nEmployees in the United States fill out and submit Form W-4 to their employers so that their employers know how much to withhold from workers' paychecks.\n\nBefore 2018, an individual was required tofill out Form W-4when hired by an employer. The form required certain personal information, such as their name,Social Security number, and the number of allowances to be claimed.\n\nThe employer used the W-4 to determine how much income to subtract from an employee\u2019spaycheckand remit to the tax authorities.\n\nThe total number of allowances claimed was important\u2014the more tax allowances claimed, the less income would be withheld from a paycheck;\u00a0the fewer allowances claimed, the more\u00a0income would be withheld.\n\nThe withholding amount was based on filing status\u2014single or married but filing separately, married and filing jointly, or head of household\u2014and the number of withholding allowances claimed on theW-4.\n\nIt was important to claim the right number of allowances to avoid paying too little in taxes or to keep from giving the government an interest-free loan by paying too much in taxes (only to receive the amount back later as a refund).\n\nMuch of how things worked before the passage of the TCJA is the same today. Individuals still fill out a W-4 which employers still use it to calculate how much income from an employee's paycheck to withhold. Tax filing status is still key.\n\nBut the IRS simplified Form W-4 and how taxpayers should determine their withholding. Now, withholding amounts relate to whether an individual has multiple jobs or a spouse who works, what credits they can claim, and other adjustments.\n\nFor example, withholding is affected if:\n\nFortunately, you\u00a0can use theIRS Withholding Calculatorto see whether you're having the right amount withheld from your paycheck.\n\nAn individual can be completely exempt from withholding, but it\u2019s not easy to receive that status.\n\nYou can claim the exemption from withholding only if you had a right to a refund of all federal income tax withheld in the prior year because you didn\u2019t have anytax liabilityand you expect the same for the current year. You simply write \u201cExempt\u201d on Form W-4.\n\nThis must be done annually; the exemption doesn\u2019t automatically carry over.\n\nA new Form W-4\u00a0must be filed with a taxpayer\u2019s employer whenever the taxpayer's personal or financial situation changes\u00a0(e.g., they get married, have a baby, or their spouse enters or leaves the workplace).\n\nThe new withholding goes into effect no later than the first payroll period ending 30 days after giving the revised form to the employer.The employer may implement it sooner but isn\u2019t required to do so.\n\nIt\u2019s also possible to request that an additional amount or a specific dollar amount be withheld in addition to other tax withholdings.\n\nThis may be helpful for taxpayers receiving a year-endbonusor for those who simply want to boost withholding near the end of the year (perhaps to cover taxes oninvestment income, such ascapital gaindistributions received at year-end).\n\nBe sure to file a new Form W-4 if your personal or financial situation changes. If you don't, you could end up having too little money withheld throughout the year, which would affect what you must pay come tax time. The IRS could also assess a financial penalty.\n\nThe short answer: You are likely to owe money when you file yourtax return. And if you have significantlyunderpaid your taxesduring the year, you may have to pay a penalty.\n\nIf you do not have enough withheld from your paycheck, you can request that your employer withhold an additional dollar sum.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you have more income withheld than you'll owe in taxes, you'll receive arefundafter you file your annual income tax return.\n\nReceiving a refund isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. It represents money you went without during the year and that could have been invested for your future financial well-being or gone toward bills.\n\nMany people think it\u2019s better to have less money withheld from their paychecks to pay taxes. Alternatively, others prefer to play it safe and overpay, mindful that they will get a refund later on down the line. Neither of these approaches is smart. The best option is to fill out Form W-4 as accurately as possible. Doing so will ensure that you don\u2019t get hit with a nasty tax bill out of the blue or essentially give the IRS an interest-free loan.\n\nThe withholding amount generally depends on a taxpayer's filing status, number of jobs, other income, and whether they have dependents.\n\nAfter an employee fills out Form W-4, it is up to the employer to calculate how much to withhold from each paycheck for federal income taxes. Payroll software should have a built-in calculator to work all this out. Alternatively, employers can consult IRSPublication 15-T: Federal Income Tax Withholding Methods.\n\nThe withholding allowance reduced how much money an employer withheld from employee paychecks for income taxes. Eliminated by an act of Congress in 2017, it could be reinstated if Congress fails to extend the TCJA tax cuts.\n\nNonetheless, it's important to ensure that your employer withholds the right amount of money from each paycheck to pay federal income taxes.\n\nIf you don't fill out Form W-4 carefully, you can get hit with a nasty tax bill out of the blue or essentially end up lending the IRS money free of charge.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Reform Provisions That Affect Individuals.\" Click \"Personal Exemption Deduction Eliminated.\"\n\nIntuit TurboTax. \"The W-4 Form Changed in Major Ways \u2014 Here\u2019s What\u2019s Different.\"\n\nIntuit TurboTax. \"Withholding Allowances: Are They Still Used on IRS Form W-4?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTax Withholding Estimator.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Individuals: Tax Reform Provisions That Affect Individuals.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cForm W-4: Employee\u2019s Withholding Certificate.\" Page 2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 753, Form W-4, Employees Withholding Certificate.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Underpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals Penalty.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Pay As You Go, so You Won\u2019t Owe: A Guide to Withholding, Estimated Taxes and Ways To Avoid the Estimated Tax Penalty.\"",
