  "term": "Theta: What It Means in Options Trading, With Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nTheta, the Greek letter \u03b8, is an options risk factor that measures the speed of decline in the value of an option as it approaches its expiration date.\n\nAn option tends to lose value at a faster rate as it gets closer to maturity or the contract's end. The Greek letter \u03b8 or \"theta\" measures this loss in value. Theta is also known as an option's time decay. It's the daily amount by which an option's value drops.\n\nTheta is generally expressed as a negative number for long positions and a positive number for short positions. It is the daily amount by which an option's value is declining. For instance, a theta of -0.05 indicates that the option's price will decrease by five cents per day.\n\nOptions give the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price\u00a0before the option expires. The strike price, also called theexercise price, is set when the contract is written. It is the price the underlying asset must reach before the option can be exercised.\n\nOptions Greeks,\u00a0or simply \u201cGreeks,\u201d are invaluable pieces of information for options investors. The mathematical variables help investors calculate the risks that influence an option\u2019s price, especially as it nears its expiration.\n\nTheta is one of the four interrelated \"Greeks\" that options traders use to evaluate the relative risk and potential rewards of an options contract. In addition to theta, they aredelta, gamma, and vega.\n\nTime is relevant for option buyers as options are only exercisable\u00a0for a set period. The option\u2019sprofitabilitydecreases as time goes on. Theta measures the rate of time decay or the erosion of an option\u2019s value as time passes.\n\nWhat if two options are similar and one expires after a longer period? The value of the longer-term option is higher since there is more time during which the option could move above the strike price.\n\nTheta is generally expressed as a negative number for long positions. The option's value diminishes as time passes until the option expires and reaches zero time value.\n\nThis is why theta is good for sellers and not so for buyers\u2014value decreases from the buyer\u2019s side as time goes by and increases for the seller.\n\nHence, selling an option is known as apositive theta trade: as theta increases, so do sellers\u2019 earnings on their options.\n\nIf all else remains the same, time decay causes an option to lose itsextrinsic valueor premium as it approaches its expiration date. Time is not on your side if you are alongoption holder.\n\nTime is on the side of the investor who writes\u00a0options. Options become less valuable as the time to their expiration decreases. It is cheaper for option writers to buy back the options and close out the short position.\n\nPut another way, option values are composed of extrinsic andintrinsic values. At option expiration, all that remains is the intrinsic value, if any, because time is a significant part of extrinsic value.\n\nTheGreeksaltogether measure\u00a0the sensitivity of options\u00a0prices to their respective variables.\n\nFor instance, the delta\u00a0of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's price in relation to a $1 change in the underlying asset. The gamma\u00a0indicates the sensitivity of an option's delta in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security.\n\nVega\u00a0indicates how an option's price theoretically changes for each one percentage point move in implied volatility.\n\nTheta has other meanings in different fields. In economics, it refers to the reserve ratio of banks in economic models.\n\nImagine you\u2019re interested in buying a call option for a stock named TechCo. The stock is trading at $50, and you\u2019re looking at a call option with a $52 strike price, expiring in 30 days. This option costs $2 per share, or $200 for a standard options contract that covers 100 shares.\n\nSuppose the theta for this option is -0.05. If everything else (stock price, volatility, interest rates, etc.) stays the same, the option will lose five cents per day in value just because time is passing.\n\nFast forward 10 days, and you find that TechCo\u2019s stock price hasn\u2019t changed. If all else stayed the same, the value of your option should have decreased only because of theta or time decay.\n\nSpecifically, you\u2019d expect a drop of 50 cents (10 days multiplied by the theta, -0.05) in the option\u2019s price. That would mean your $2 option is now worth $1.50.\n\nHence, understanding theta helps you grasp how the ticking of the clock affects your options investments.\n\nTime decay gradually erodes an option\u2019s value as the expiration date approaches. Knowing this can help you make more informed decisions for your trading strategy.\n\nIt depends on whether you're buying or selling. As time passes, the option becomes cheaper, which is good for the seller. This option seller will profit if the underlying asset is neutral, bearish for a short call, and bullish for a short put.\n\nThe highest theta is for at-the-money options, and the lowest is for the furthestout-of-the-moneyand in-the-money options. For an option that is at the money or nearly so, the absolute value of theta rises as the expiration date is reached.\n\nYes, theta decays on weekends. Options models usually take into consideration weekends, so decay will occur over seven days, not the five trading days.\n\nTheta can appear positive, particularly when you\u2019re short (or \u201cwriting\u201d) an option. If you\u2019ve sold an option, the passage of time works in your favor, making the option less valuable\u2014which is good when you eventually buy it back at a lower price or let it expire worthless.\n\nIn the case of selling options, while the theta of the option itself is technically negative, the effect on your position is positive.\n\nTheta and volatility have a complex relationship. Generally speaking, when market volatility is high, option prices go up, which can also cause theta to increase. This is because the higher premium associated with the option will have more to lose each day as it approaches expiration.\n\nHowever, an increase in theta doesn't necessarily mitigate the impact of rising volatility. In a volatile market, the option price can swing dramatically, overshadowing the slow erosion of time decay.\n\nSo, while theta might increase in a high-volatility market, the option's price could still rise if the increased volatility is even more significant.\n\nIn the options market, time decay is a noteworthy factor that can erode potential profits for buyers while benefiting sellers. Whether you're taking a long position buying an option or writing options, understanding theta can make the difference between a profitable trade and a losing gamble.\n\nIf you're an option buyer, time is not on your side since it gradually saps the value of your investment. If you're on the selling end, time decay is your ally, making it cheaper to close out your short position as the option's value decreases.",
