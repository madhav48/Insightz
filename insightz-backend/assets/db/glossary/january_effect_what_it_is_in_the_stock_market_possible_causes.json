  "definition": "Is the 'January Effect' a Tradable Seasonal Strategy?\n\nGordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nJiwon Ma is a fact checker and research analyst with a background in cybersecurity, international security, technology, and privacy policies. Before joining Investopedia, she consulted for a global financial institution on cybersecurity policies and conducted research as a Research Analyst at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nThe January effect is the supposed increase in stock prices in the first month of the year.\n\nThe January effect is the name given to the belief in a seasonal increase in stock prices in the first month of each year. People have generally attributed a supposed rally each January to the rise in buying that follows the price drop that typically happens each December. However, data for this phenomenon over the last several decades has proven inconclusive.\n\nThe argument for the effect is that at the end of each year, investors tend to sell off securities at a loss to offset their capital gains and lower their tax bills, prompting a sell-off. After the New Year, they repurchase the stocks, creating a greater demand for a range of shares in the market, leading to the January effect.Another explanation for the phenomenon is that investors use year-end cash bonuses to buy investments the following month.\n\nWhile this market anomaly has been identified in the past, the January effect has disappeared in recent years, if it ever existed, and studies of previous eras have shown it correlated less with lower prices in December than with continuing bullishness during the last months of the previous year.In short, the evidence doesn't seem to match the explanations.\n\nRebecca Walser, named by Investopedia as a top advisor for 2023, doesn't think there's much to the theory. But, she added, if there's anything to it, she would \"attribute it much more to human psychology than tax loss harvesting or mutual fund window dressing.\"\n\nAnother Investopedia top advisor,Preston D. Cherry, agrees with Walser, calling it little more than \"a folktale.\" But Cherry said there was much to learn from the supposed \"effect\": \"Investors must follow a disciplined and tailored investment strategy unique to their goals, risk tolerance and capacity,\" he told Investopedia. \"The best long-term investment strategies have a consistent commitment and a why attached to the action rather than following the herd.\"\n\nInvestment banker Sidney Wachtel is said to have first noticed the January effect in 1942.Like all calendar-related effects, the hypothesis suggests that the markets are inefficient since efficient markets would naturally make this effect disappear.\n\nOur own look back at the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since its 1993 inception makes one wonder how the term ever came to be used. Of the 31 years since, there have been 18 winning January months (58%) and 13 losing January months (42%), making the odds of a gain slightly higher than the flip of a coin.Further, from the start of the 2009 market rally through January 2024, January months showed eight positive vs. eight losing months, a 46% to 54% ratio. Given the strong rally since 2009, one might rightly expect a more pronounced number of January winners, but this has not been the case.\n\nThe first month of the year turns out not to be a particularly compelling trading month out of the year, with middling performance at best. Historically, according to data cited by Nasdaq, it's been in positive territory but ranks eighth out of the 12 months over the last 20 years.\n\nTheefficient market hypothesisargues that share prices reflect all the information that is available to the market. Based on the theory, since all market participants have access to the same information, outperforming the market through stock selection or market timing is not practical. The efficient market hypothesis is an argument against seasonal phenomena like the January effect.\n\nBesides tax-loss harvesting with post-New Year repurchases and investors putting cash bonuses into the market, another explanation for the January effect has to do with investor psychology. Some investors argue that January is the best month to begin an investment program or that many are following through on a New Year's resolution to begin investing for the future.\n\nOthers have posited that mutual fund managers buy the stocks of top performers at the end of the year and get rid of losing\u00a0assets for\u00a0the sake of appearances in their year-end reports, an activity known as \"window dressing.\" This is unlikely, however, since trading would primarily affect large caps, and the effect, when found, has been seen as greater in small caps.\n\nYear-end sell-offs could attract buyers interested in the lower prices, knowing that the dips are not based on company fundamentals. On a wide enough scale, this could drive prices higher in January.\n\nJeffrey Hirsch, who took over editing the annualStock Trader's Almanacfor this father, who named many of the best known calendar effects (theSanta Claus rally, etc.), cautioned against being too literal in trading on the history of any of them. \"They're not automatic,\" Hirsch says. \"Buy this day, sell that day...You gotta see what's going on on the ground. You've got to do some homework.\"\n\nStudies on the January effect generally back Walser's view. The effect has long been one of the wider-known market anomalies, so it's no surprise that it's given rise to a wealth of studies. A look back should give us some humility when citing truisms about the market\u2014like the dumping of stocks in December leads to a bullish market in January\u2014that have become outdated or might have been misidentified by previous researchers in the first place. For example, as we've seen, it's never been clear that sell-offs in December led to purchases in January since the better-traded January months correlate to better December trading months, not those that had massive sell-offs.\n\nEarly research by Rozeff and Kinney highlighted that this stock market's seasonal anomaly could be linked to patterns in investor behavior, such as tax-loss selling in December followed by reinvestment in January.\n\nLater, Keim expanded on this idea, suggesting that institutional window-dressing and individual tax strategies played a role, particularly for small cap stocks. Additionally there was Haugen and Jorion who compounded the narrative by associating the January Effect with behavioral finance factors like overreaction and seasonal portfolio adjustments.\n\nSubsequent studies have reinforced and broadened the industry's understanding of the January Effect. In 2005, Haug and Hirschey found that the anomaly persisted even after the Tax Reform Act of 1986, indicating that other drivers beyond tax-related behavior could be influencing the effect.Lakshya Batta explored the phenomenon's global consistency and suggested additional explanations such as performance hedging and seasonal liquidity.Furthermore, research published delved into cross-sectional impacts, demonstrating that sentiment driven stocks earned higher returns in January, supporting the behavioral finance argument.\n\nIndeed, the January Effect is not confined to the US, as Tyler Folliott's global study showed. While the effect was significant in some markets, it varied globally, with other anomalies, like a September Effect, also emerging.\n\nIn this world of finance and investing the January Effect remains a fascinating and complex market anomaly that continues to evolve under the influence of investor behavior and market dynamics.\n\nJanuary effect skeptics have primarily focused on the lack of recent data showing its continuing impact, problems identifying its causes, and how it's become moot given the evolution of financial markets. Let's take these in turn:\n\nWhile the January Effect remains an interesting historical phenomenon, it appears that its relevance in modern markets has wanted, and investors are advised to consider other factors when making investment and trading decisions.\n\nUnlikely. Even if the January effect were real (it's probably not) and markets were to rise uncharacteristically each January, the fact that people may try to exploit this would undermine its appearance. For example, in anticipation of higher prices in January, some would move in December to pick up certain assets. But that demand itself would lessen the price changes between before and after the New Year.\n\nBesides the supposed January effect, there are other monthly phenomena said to be observed in the stock market, although they are less prominent. For instance, the \"Sell in May and Go Away\" strategy is based on the supposed historical underperformance of stocks in the period from May to October.Another is the \"December effect,\" where stock prices often increase in December, possibly due to tax-related trading, holiday spending, or investor optimism. In addition, the \"October effect\" was once said to be a real market anomaly since investors were said to fear market declines that month, partly because of historical market crashes in 1929 and 1987. One month does consistently stick out: September. Over 10 and 20-year time frames, as well as the period going back to 1950, it has been consistently the worst month for trading.\n\nTheJanuary barometer, also called \"the other January effect,\" is a folk theory of the stock market claiming that the returns in January will predict the stock market's overall performance for that year. Thus, a strong January would predict a bull market and a down January would augur a bear market. Actual evidence for this effect is scant.\n\nThe January effect is a market theory suggesting that January often has consistent gains, though the evidence for it has been elusive in recent decades. Despite this, market commentators frequently cite it to explain any positive performance in January. They often link January's buying activity to post-year-end tax-loss sales. However, the relevance of this rationale has greatly diminished over time as more investors shift to tax-sheltered plans like401(k)s.\n\nTraders are advised to approach the January effect skeptically and focus on the prevailing market conditions as the year turns rather than relying on this increasingly questionable market lore.\n\nA.
