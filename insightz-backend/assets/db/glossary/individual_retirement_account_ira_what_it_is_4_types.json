  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nAn individual retirement account (IRA)\u2014known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS\u2014is a long-term, tax-advantaged savings account that individuals with earned income can use to save for the future.\n\nThe IRA is designed primarily for self-employed people who do not have access to workplace retirement accounts such as the 401(k), which is available only through employers. However, you can also have an IRA even if you already have a retirement plan at work.\n\nYou can open an IRA through a bank, an investment company, an online brokerage, or a personal broker.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nAnyone withearned incomecan open and contribute to an IRA, including those who have a 401(k) account through an employer. The only limitation is on the total that you can contribute to your retirement accounts in a single year.\n\nThe best IRA accounts will offer the ability to invest in a wide range of financial products, includingstocks,bonds,exchange-traded funds (ETFs), andmutual funds.\n\nThere are alsoself-directed IRAs (SDIRAs)that permit investors to make all the investing decisions. SDIRAs offer access to a broader selection of investments, including real estate and commodities. Only the riskiest investments are off-limits.\n\nThere are several kinds of IRAs, each with different rules regarding eligibility, taxation, and withdrawals. These types include:\n\nIndividual taxpayers can establish traditional and Roth IRAs. Small business owners and self-employed individuals can set up SEP and SIMPLE IRAs.\n\nAn IRA must be opened with an institution that has received Internal Revenue Service (IRS) approval to offer these accounts. Choices include banks, brokerages, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations.\n\nBecause IRAs are meant to be used to invest andmaximize the growth of fundsfor retirement savings, there is usually anearly withdrawal penalty of 10%if you take money out before age 59\u00bd. That's in addition to taxes you'd pay on the withdrawn amount.\n\nHowever, there are somenotable exceptionsto the penalty rule\u2014withdrawals for educational expenses and first-time home purchases, among others.\n\nA Roth account is funded with post-tax money, so no further taxes are due when the money is withdrawn.\n\nYou can only contribute to an IRA if you have earned income. Income from interest and dividends, Social Security benefits, or child support does not count.\n\nThe following is a breakdown of the various types of IRAs and the rules regarding each one.\n\nIn most cases, contributions to traditional IRAs are tax deductible. So, if you put $4,000 into an IRA, your taxable income for the year decreases by that amount.\n\nIn a traditional IRA, your money grows tax-deferred. When youwithdraw it after retiring, it is taxed at yourordinary incometax rate for that year.\n\nFor 2024 and 2025, the maximum annual individual contribution is $7,000. The catch-up contribution continues to be $1,000 for those 50 and over.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a retirement plan at work, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible. But if you (or your spouse, if you are married) have a retirement plan at work, such as a401(k)or403(b), yourmodified adjusted gross income(MAGI) determines whether and how much of your traditional IRA contributions can be deducted.\n\nIf You Have a Retirement Plan at Work\n\nFor 2024, if you are single or file as head of household and have a retirement plan at work, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible if your MAGI is below $77,000 ($79,000 for 2025).\n\nIf you are married and filing jointly, your traditional IRA contributions are fully deductible if your MAGI is below $123,000 in 2024 ($126,000 in 2025). From there, the deductibility of your contributions starts to phase out as your MAGI increases.\n\nIt is possible to have both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA or several IRAs at different institutions. However, the total annual contribution to all of your IRAs cannot exceed $7,000 (or $8,000 for those age 50 or older) for 2024 and 2025.\n\nFor 2024, the income range that phases out the deductibility of traditional IRA contributions for married couples is $123,000 to $143,000. For 2025, it's $126,000 to $146,000.\n\nFor single taxpayers or heads of households, the phase-out range for 2024 is $77,000 to $87,000.For 2025, it is $79,000 to $89,000.\n\nIf You Don't Have a Plan at Work but Your Spouse Does\n\nIf you contribute to an IRA and aren't covered by a workplace plan but are married to someone who is, the income phase-out range in 2024 is $230,000 to $240,000 ($236,000 to $246,000 for 2025).\n\nUse this chart to see how much of your contribution may be deductible.\n\nRoth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible in the year in which you make them. But the distributions are tax-free. That means you contribute to a Roth IRA using after-tax dollars and pay no taxes, even on your investment gains.\n\nAlso, Roth IRAs do not haverequired minimum distributions (RMDs). If you don\u2019t need the money, you don\u2019t have to take it out of your account (where it continues growing tax-free). You can contribute to a Roth IRA as long as you have eligible earned income, no matter how old you are.\n\nRoth IRA contribution limits for the 2024 and 2025tax yearsare the same as they are for traditional IRAs. However, there is a catch: There areincome limitationson contributions to a Roth IRA.\n\nThe phase-out range for single filers is $146,000 to $161,000 for 2024 ($150,000 to $165,000 for 2025). For married couples filing joint returns, the phase-out range is $230,000 to $240,000 in 2024 ($236,000 to $246,000 in 2025).\n\nIf you reach age 72 after Dec. 31, 2022, you must begin takingrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)at age 73. That applies to withdrawals from traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts as well as SIMPLE and SEP IRAs. (Roth account owners aren\u2019t subject to RMDs.) The penalty for failing to take an RMD is from 10% to 25% of the amount not withdrawn.\n\nSelf-employed individuals such as independent contractors, freelancers, and small-business owners can set up SEP IRAs.\n\nA SEP IRA adheres to the same tax rules for withdrawals as a traditional IRA. For 2024, SEP IRA contributions are limited to 25% of compensation or $69,000, whichever is less.In 2025, you can still contribute up to 25% of compensation, but the limit is $70,000.\n\nBusiness owners who set up SEP IRAs for their employees are able to deduct the contributions that they make on behalf of employees. However, the employees cannot contribute to their own accounts, and the IRS taxes their withdrawals as income.\n\nThe SIMPLE IRA is also intended for small businesses and self-employed individuals. This type of IRA follows the same tax rules for withdrawals as a traditional IRA.\n\nUnlike SEP IRAs,SIMPLE IRAs allow employees to make contributionsto their accounts, and the employer is required to make contributions as well. All the contributions are tax-deductible, potentially pushing the business or employee into a lower tax bracket.\n\nThe SIMPLE IRA employee contribution limit is $16,000 (or $16,500 for 2025), and the maximum catch-up amount is $3,500.\n\nIn 2008, the IRS issued Revenue Ruling 2008-5, which states that IRA transactions cantrigger the wash-sale rule. Should shares be sold in a non-retirement account, followed by the purchase of substantially identical shares in an IRA within a 30-day period, the investor cannot claim tax losses for the sale. The investment\u2019s basis in the individual\u2019s IRA won\u2019t increase, either.\n\nRequired minimum distributions (RMDs) are withdrawals that owners of traditional IRA and 401(k) accounts must take every year after they reach a certain age. The age has been revised upwards a couple of times. As of Jan. 1, 2023, an account holder must begin taking money out in the year they turn age 73. That age rises to 75 in 2033.\n\nThe amount a person must withdraw is based on the account size and the person's life expectancy. The IRS has a worksheet to calculate the amount.\n\nFailure to take the minimum triggers a severe tax penalty, which is 25% of the balance of the account. That's half the previous penalty but still expensive enough to keep us on our toes.\n\nHowever, this penalty can be reduced to 10% in many cases if the taxpayer takes corrective action early.\n\nUse the chart below to get a better sense of how the different IRAs work.\n\nNote: To view the full chart, use the slider at the bottom to see the column at the far right.\n\nThe acronym \"IRA\" is used to refer to two distinct but overlapping concepts. For the Internal Revenue Service, the term stands for \"individual retirement arrangement,\" a selection of plans available that provide tax advantages to people saving for retirement.\n\nIn common usage, IRA also stands for \"individual retirement account,\" a type of plan that one can pay into throughout one's career and withdraw from in retirement. In such cases, a plan would be both a retirement account for a specific person and an individual retirement arrangement in the eyes of the IRS.\n\nAn IRA offers a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. Depending on what type of IRA you use, it can reduce your tax bill when you make contributions or take withdrawals in retirement. Investment gains are tax-deferred (for a traditional IRA) or tax-free (for a Roth IRA).\n\nThat means contributing money towards your retirement eitherreduces your taxes on incomefor the year or eliminates the taxes from your retirement money.\n\nIRAs are insured by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), a government-run agency that provides protection when a financial institution fails. The FDIC covers customer deposits\u2014up to $250,000 per account in most cases\u2014that are held at FDIC-insured banks or savings and loan associations.\n\nYou canopen your IRAat most banks, credit unions, online brokers, or other financial services providers. Fidelity, Charles Schwab, and E*Trade are all brokers that provide IRAs.\n\nOpening an account is as easy as visiting a bank branch or website and filling in a form.\n\nThe best time to withdraw from an IRA is at age 59\u00bd and beyond. If you withdraw before age 59\u00bd, you will incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty in addition to taxes on the withdrawal. There are some exceptions to this penalty for medical expenses, disabilities, first-time home purchases, and other unusual life events. Generally speaking, the longer you can wait before taking distributions, themore time that money has to grow.\n\nBoth 401(k) plans and IRAs provide tax advantages to employees investing for their retirement. But, a 401(k) plan is only available through an employer. Contributions are automatically deducted from the employee\u2019s paycheck. Some companies match part of employee contributions. Also, 401(k) plans have higher contribution limits.\n\nAn IRA can be set up by anyone who has earned income, regardless of whether they have a 401(k) plan at work. Most 401(k) plans offer a limited choice of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). An IRA can offer a wider range of funds, stocks, and other securities.\n\nIRAs are retirement savings accounts that offer tax advantages. They work a bit like a 401(k) but don\u2019t require an employer to sponsor them. There are several types of IRAs: traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SEP IRAs, and SIMPLE IRAs.\n\nThere are annual income limitations on deducting contributions to traditional IRAs and contributing to Roth IRAs, so there is a limit on how much tax you can avoid by investing in an IRA.\n\nIRAs are meant to be long-term retirement savings accounts. If you take money out early, you defeat that purpose by diminishing your retirement assets. That\u2019s why money held in an IRA usually can\u2019t be withdrawn before age 59\u00bd without incurring a hefty tax penalty of 10% of the amount withdrawn (in addition to normal taxes owed).\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cWhat if I Withdraw Money From My IRA?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRA-Based Plans.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics\u2014Exceptions to Tax on Early Distributions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cEarned Income and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Tables.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 451, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(K) Limit Increases to $23,500 for 2025, IRA Limit Remains $7,000.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics\u2014IRA Contribution Limits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Limit Increases to $23,000 for 2024, IRA Limit Rises to $7,000.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTraditional and Roth IRAs.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Amount of Roth IRA Contributions That You Can Make for 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"SEP Contribution Limits (Including Grandfathered SARSEPs).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCOLA Increases for Dollar Limitations on Benefits and Contributions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cSEP Plan FAQs.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cSIMPLE IRA Plan.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics\u2014SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRev.
