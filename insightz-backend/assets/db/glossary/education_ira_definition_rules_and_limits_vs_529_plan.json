  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn education IRA is a tax-advantaged investment account for higher education, now more formally known as aCoverdell Education Savings Account(ESA). Under this educational savings vehicle, parents and guardians are allowed to make nondeductible contributions to an educationindividual retirement account(IRA) for a child under the age of 18.\n\nFunds saved under an education IRA are meant to be used to cover future educational expenses such as tuition, books, and uniforms at the elementary, secondary, and higher education levels.The funds in an education IRA can be withdrawntax-freewhen they are needed for educational purposes.\n\nEducation IRAs are also referred to as \"Coverdell accounts\" or\u00a0simply \"ESAs.\" Despite their \"IRA\" moniker, they are for educational expenses, notretirementsavings, though they work in a similar way.\n\nEducation IRAs existed before they were renamed Coverdell ESAs in 2002 and were made even more attractive as an educational savings vehicle when the list of qualified expenses was extended to certain K-12 expenses.They work in a way similar to Roth IRAs, in that both allow\u00a0annual, nondeductible contributions to a specially designatedinvestmentaccount. That investment grows free of federal taxes,\u00a0and withdrawals aretax-freeas well, as long as certain requirements are met related to the year's contributions and the year's withdrawals.\n\nEducation IRAs have many conditions and stipulations, such as:\n\nBoth the educational IRA and the 529 plan allow plan holders to set up an account for a beneficiary of their choice. The tax treatment of education IRAs\u00a0is\u00a0similar to that of529 savings plans, though with a few notable differences. Both allow for tax-deferred growth and for those proceeds to be withdrawn tax-free for qualified educational expenses at a qualified educational institution. Education IRAs\u00a0are covered under Title 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter F, Part VIII, Subsection 530 of the U.S. Code.\n\nThere is no limit to how many 529 plans a plan holder can set up.Contributions, though, are limited to the cost of education as outlined by the state where the accounts are held. Although accounts are set up forbeneficiaries, they cannot lay claim to the funds. These plans can cover a number of different things:\n\nTheTax Cuts and Jobs Act(TCJA) of 2017 made changes to the rules involving 529 plans.Plan holders can use up to a maximum of $10,000 to pay for K-12 tuition from public, private, or religious institutions per beneficiary each year\u2014penalty- and tax-free.\n\nAdditional changes expanded the rules for 529 plans when theSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act(SECURE) was signed into law in December 2019.The owner of the account canwithdraw up to $10,000to use toward the payment of tuition and other related expenses for a beneficiary's registered apprenticeship programs. Another change includes the ability for plan holders to withdraw a lifetime maximum of $10,000 to pay down a beneficiary's qualified student debt.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 310 Coverdell Education Savings Accounts.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education.\"\n\nSaving for College. \"Coverdell Education Savings Accounts.\"\n\nUnited States Code. \"Part VIII\u2014Certain Savings Entities.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \u201cH.R.1 - An Act to Provide For Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \u201cSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act).\u201d",
