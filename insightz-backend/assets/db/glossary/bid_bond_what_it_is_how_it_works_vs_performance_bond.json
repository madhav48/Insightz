  "term": "Bid Bond: What It Is, How It Works, vs. Performance Bond",
  "definition": "A bid bond is a financial pledge from a bidder to a project owner, confirming the bidder's commitment to a project and that the project owner will be compensated if the bidder fails to come through.\n\nA bid bond guarantees compensation to the bond owner if the bidder fails to begin a project. Bid bonds are often used for construction jobs or other projects with similar bid-based selection processes.\n\nThe function of the bid bond is to provide a guarantee to the project owner that the bidder will complete the work if selected. The existence of a bid bond gives the owner assurance that the bidder has the financial means to accept the job for the price quoted in the bid.\n\nBid bonds ensure that contractors can comply with bid contracts and will fulfill their job responsibilities at agreed-upon prices. Most public construction contracts requirecontractorsorsubcontractorsto secure their bids by providing bonds that serve as a means of legal and financial protection to the client.\n\nWithout bid bonds, project owners would have no way of guaranteeing that the bidder they select for a project would be able to complete the job properly.\n\nFor example, an underfunded bidder might run into cash flow problems along the way. Bid bonds also help clients avoid frivolous bids, which saves time when analyzing and choosing contractors.\n\nWhile most project owners typically require between 5% and 10% of the tender price upfront as a penalty sum, federally funded projects require 20% of the bid. The cost of the bond depends on several factors, including the jurisdiction of the project work, bid amount, and contractual terms.\n\nFor example, a contractor that is making a $250,000 bid to provide roofing for an elementary school will have to submit a bid bond of $50,000. This bid bond is required along with a proposal to be taken seriously as a contender for a federal contract.\n\nA bid bond can be a written guarantee made out by a third-partyguarantorand submitted to a client or project owner. The bid bond affirms that the contractor has the required funds necessary to carry out the project.\n\nTypically, bid bonds are submitted as a cash deposit by contractors for a tendered bid. A contractor purchases a bid bond from asurety, which carries out extensive financial and background checks on a contractor before approving the bond.\n\nSeveral factors determine whether a contractor will be issued a bid bond. They include the company'scredit historyand the number of years of experience in the field. Financial statements may also be examined to determine the overall financial health of the company.\n\nA surety bond involves three primary players: the financial\u00a0guarantor or surety\u00a0of a construction bond, guaranteeing the obligee that the contractor (called the principal) will act in accordance with the terms established by the bond.\n\nBoth the surety and contractor are held liable if the contractor fails to abide by any of the contract's conditions.\n\nA bid bond is replaced by a performance bond when a bid is accepted and the contractor proceeds to work on the project.\n\nA performance bondprotects a client from a contractor's failure to performaccording to the contractual terms. If the work done by a contractor is poor or defective, a project owner can make a claim against the performance bond. The bond provides compensation for the cost of redoing or correcting the job.\n\nIf the contractor does not meet the obligations of the bid bond, the contractor and the surety are heldjointly and severally liablefor the bond. A client will usually opt for the lowest bidder since it will mean reduced costs for the company.\n\nIf a contractor wins the bid but decides not to execute the contract for one reason or another, the client will be forced to award the second-lowest bidder the contract and pay more.\n\nIn this instance, the project owner can claim the full or partial amount of the bid bond. A bid bond is thus anindemnity bondthat protects a client if a winning bidder fails to execute the contract or provide the required performance bonds.\n\nThe amount claimed against a bid bond typically covers the difference between the lowest bid and the next lowest bid.\n\nThis difference will be paid by the bonding company or surety, which may sue the contractor to recover the costs. Whether the surety can sue the contractor depends on the terms of the bid bond.\n\nA contract bid is most commonly associated with a proposal and price submitted by a contractor or service provider to a soliciting firm for a business opportunity involving construction or renovation projects.\n\nWhile having good credit is always helpful in matters like these, those with poor credit may still be able to obtain bid bonds from companies that agree to do so, but these will often be more costly to obtain.\n\nYes, once a project successfully begins per the contract, the bid bond amount is returned to the bidder. If the project does not begin due to issues on the bidder's part, then the project owner can keep the bid bond to cover any losses they may incur. Once the project begins, the bid bond is returned and replaced with a performance bond.\n\nBid bonds help project owners manage the start of construction projects. They are a type of guarantee, giving the project owner assurance by demonstrating the bidder is capable and financially equipped to do the job.\n\nAssociated Builders and Contractors (ABC). \"FAQs on Executive Order 14063 and the Biden Administration\u2019s Other ProPLA Policies on Federal and Federally Assisted Construction Projects,\" Page 1.",
