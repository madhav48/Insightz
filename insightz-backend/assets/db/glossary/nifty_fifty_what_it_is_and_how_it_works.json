  "term": "Nifty Fifty: What it is and how it Works",
  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nThe Nifty Fifty was a group of 50 large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange that were most favored byinstitutional investorsin the 1960s and 1970s. Investment in these top 50 stocks\u2014similar to blue-chip stocks of today\u2014is said to have propelled the American economy to its bull market of the 1970s. Companies in this group were usually characterized by consistent earnings growth and highP/E ratios.\n\nThe Nifty Fifty stocks got their notoriety in thebull marketsof the 1960s and early 1970s. They became known as \"one-decision\" stocks because investors were told by individuals such as University of Pennsylvania professor Jeremy Siegel that they couldbuy and holdthem forever. That wasn't always the case. Though no one comprehensive list exists of the Nifty Fifty, examples of some of these stocks include General Electric (GE), Coca-Cola (KO), and IBM (IBM). However, part of this list included companies that have been troubled in the last decade, such as Xerox and Polaroid.\n\nThe Nifty Fifty should not be confused with the CNX Nifty 50. The latter is an Indian Stock Exchange index that covers 13 sectors of the nation's economy.\n\nHistorically Nifty Fifty stocks were favored in part due to their high price-to-earnings or P/E ratios. P/E ratios compare a stock\u2019s current market value (price) to its earnings-per-share. Earnings are the company\u2019s net profits, which the CEO and investor relations team announce each quarter on the company\u2019s earnings conference call. The P/E ratio indicates the dollar amount an investor should invest in a company to receive one dollar of that company\u2019s earnings. The P/E is thus sometimes referred to as the price multiple.\n\nToday, high P/E ratios, such as with many technology companies (i.e., Tesla\u2019s (TSLA)\u00a0forward P/E of 1,076) can indicate volatility and a lack of stability. If the company\u2019s price is significantly higher than its actual concrete earnings, this imbalance could suggest investors have over-hyped the company. If the company fails to generate profits, investors who have purchased the stock at a highvaluationcould see their holdings decline if the market catches on and prices drop accordingly.\n\nToday\u2019sblue-chip stocks, in several ways, resemble the Nifty Fifty stocks of prior decades. Blue-chip stocks are nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound companies such as Coca-Cola, Disney, PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, General Electric, IBM, and McDonald\u2019s. Dominant in their respective industries, many of these namesoverlap with those in the Nifty Fifty. Blue-chip stocks represent highly reputable brands and have survived multiple downturns in the economy over the years.\n\nInvestors with a low-risk profile (i.e. more conservative or potentially older investors, nearing retirement and looking for stability) often place their assets in blue-chip stocks. These are excellent options for capital preservation. Steady dividend payments provide a stream of income if the investor does not have a salary and also protects the portfolio against inflation.",
