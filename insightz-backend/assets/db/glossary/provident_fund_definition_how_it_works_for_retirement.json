  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA provident fund is a government-managed retirement savings scheme used primarily in Asia and Africa.\n\nIn some ways, these funds are a hybrid of401(k) plansandSocial Securityin the United States. They also share some traits withpension funds.\n\nWorkers contribute a portion of their salaries to a provident fund. Employers also contribute on behalf of their employees. With some funds, contributions may be compulsory.\n\nThe money in the fund is held and managed by the government and eventually withdrawn by retirees or, in certain cases, their surviving families.\n\nIn some instances, the fund also pays out to people who cannot work due to disability.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nProvident funds, though not new, are particularly useful in the 21st century. Given the unstable nature of societies across the globe, general savings may not be enough to sustain workers once they retire.\n\nThe challenge of retirement has been further deepened by social change and changing family structures. In some societies, for example, aging adults were provided for by their extended families.\n\nBut declining birth rates, widely-dispersed family members, and longer life expectancies have made it more difficult to maintain this traditional safety net.\n\nFor these reasons and more, governments stepped in to providelong-termfinancial support to retirees and people with disabilities. Provident funds are an example of this action.\n\nNormally, a nation's government is responsible for administering provident funds and managing their investments. But a third-party manager can be hired to handle these tasks.\n\nGenerally, provident funds are designed like defined contribution plans. For employees, contributions can be voluntary, mandatory, or both. For employers, they are mandatory.\n\nEach national provident fund sets its own minimum and maximum contribution levels for workers and employers.\n\nMinimum contributions can vary depending on a worker\u2019s age. Some funds allow individuals to contribute extra to their benefit accounts. Employers also make contributions on behalf of employees.\n\nGovernments set the age limit at which penalty-free withdrawals may begin. Some pre-retirement withdrawals may be allowed under special circumstances, such as medical emergencies.\n\nAdditionally, in South Africa, provident fundpayoutscan be claimed at any age if the person has been a non-resident for three uninterrupted years.\n\nIn many countries, those who work past the minimum retirement age may face restricted withdrawals until full retirement.\n\nIf a worker dies before receiving benefits, the surviving spouse and children may be able to receive survivors' benefits.\n\nProvident funds differ from another state-managed vehicle, thesovereign wealth fund. The latter is a wealth-generating investment vehicle funded by government revenue that finances national interests.\n\nAs is the case with Social Security in the U.S., the money in provident funds is held by the government, not by privatefinancial institutions.\n\nHowever, Social Security benefits are paid with tax revenues held by two trust funds\u2014the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. Both are part of the U.S. Department of the Treasury.\n\nIn 2024, the estimated effective interest rate earned by the two trust funds combined was 2.5%.\n\nProvident funds differ from Social Security in that they involve individual accounts instead of a group account.\n\nSuch provident funds resemble the ownership of a 401(k). And as with a 401(k), some provident funds allow the individual to determine how the money is invested.\n\nWith other provident funds, the government makes the investment decisions instead.\n\nA provident fund is a government-mandated and -managed retirement savings plan that helps employees prepare for retirement. Employees and their employers contribute to the plan.\n\nHow much you receive will depend on the returns generated by your plan over time. In addition, some plans allow forlump-sumdistributions, while others mandate a monthly payment.\n\nA provident fund is a government-managed plan, whereas aretirement annuityis a private insurance product. Both can help you prepare for and sustain a financially healthy retirement, but each comes with their own pros and cons. For example, an annuity can provide access to a wider range of investment options, but it also most likely has higher fees that a provident fund.\n\nThough the money held in private savings accounts across the world continues to grow, for many, it's not enough to provide a comfortable life in retirement.\n\nA provident fund finances such support in a way that readily scales payouts to the available balance and enlists employers and workers to help cover the cost.\n\nIf you have questions about your provident fund plan, be sure to talk to your plan administrator.\n\nWoodruff Sawyer. \"Navigating Provident Fund Systems.\"\n\nSouth African Revenue Service. \"Subject: 1 March 2021 Legislative Amendments.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Disability Insurance Trust Fund.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Old-Age & Survivors Insurance Trust Fund.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Effective Interest Rates.\"",
