  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe Orange Book is a list of drugs and pharmaceuticals that theU.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) has approved as both safe and effective. Although it is commonly called the Orange Book, its formal name is Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations.\n\nThe Orange Book does not include drugs only approved as safe; they must also have been proven to be effective. Drugs whose safety or efficacy approval has been withdrawn are excluded from the Orange Book. However, a drug that is currently subject to regulatory action may still appear in the Orange Book.\n\nThe FDA approves new drugs, or existing drugs for new uses, following a series of double-blind randomizedclinical trials. Early phases of this process involve tests to judge the safety of a compound, to make sure it does not cause severe side effects or harm. Phase 3 trials are conducted on larger samples to prove both safety and efficacy against a placebo.If successful, the drug will be added to the Orange Book and approved for use.\n\nThe Orange Book is available online for free. This makes it easy for medical professionals to search for generic equivalents to brand-name drugs, drug patents, and drug exclusivity. Consumers can also access the Orange Book online. Both patients and doctors can see approved uses for drugs and patent expiration dates for name-brand drugs.\n\nA doctor or patient can see if there is a generic equivalent to a brand-name drug by doing an active ingredient search. For Prozac, you would search the Orange Book for \u201cfluoxetine hydrochloride.\u201d To be able to market and sell a generic drug, the generic drugmaker must file anAbbreviated New Drug Application(ANDA) with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The drugmaker must prove that the drug isbioequivalentto the brand-name drug. If an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) is approved, the generic drug will be listed in the Orange Book.\n\nFor example, a search for the prescription antidepressant drug Prozac shows that the drug is available in different forms (capsules, tablets, solutions, delayed-release pellets, etc.) and it is also available in varying dosage strengths. This search also reveals that five forms of the drug have been discontinued, although in three instances it has been noted that the product was not discontinued or withdrawn for safety or efficacy reasons. The capsules were first approved in 1987, and the drug is approved for acute treatment of treatment-resistant depression in adults.\n\nThe Orange Book also shows that the drug\u2019s active ingredient is fluoxetine hydrochloride, which may be generically available at a lower cost.\n\nWhen a new drug is introduced to the public, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) awards the drugmaker a medical patent that protects the product from competitors for a given period of time.Orphan drugpatents last for seven years, while a new chemical entity exclusivity lasts for five years.\n\nUnder the Hatch-Waxman Act, in order for a generic drug manufacturer to win approval, they must certify that they will not launch their generic product until after the expiration of the patent.\n\nThe Orange Book is available as a PDF, in print, and electronically. The electronic version of the Orange Book is the most up-to-date because there are updates made daily, including generic drug approvals and patent information. Other information may only be updated monthly, such as new drug application approvals ad discontinued products.\n\nPatent terms are set by statute. Currently, the term of a new patent is 20 years from the date on which the application for the patent was filed in the United States. Many other factors can affect the duration of a patent.\n\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration. \"Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations | Orange Book.\" Accessed Aug. 26, 2021.\n\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration. \"Step 3: Clinical Research.\" Accessed Aug. 26, 2021.\n\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration. \"Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA).\" Accessed Aug. 26, 2021.\n\nU.S. Food & Drug Administration. \"Prozac,\" Page 1.
