EAs must pass an examination or have sufficient experience as an IRS employee and pass a background check.Enrolled agents first appeared in 1884 due to issues arising with Civil War loss claims.\n\nAn enrolled agent is a federally licensed tax practitioner who has unlimited rights to represent taxpayers before the IRS for any issues relating to collections,audits, ortax appeals.

The enrolled agent profession began after fraudulent claims were submitted for Civil War losses. Congress took action to regulate EAs to prepare Civil War claims and represent citizens in their interactions with the Treasury Department. In 1884, the Horse Act was signed into law by President Chester Arthur to establish and standardize enrolled agents.\n\nIn 1913, when the 16th Amendment was passed, EA duties expanded to includetax preparationand resolving taxpayer disputes with the IRS. In 1972, a group of enrolled agents collaborated to form the\u00a0NAEA to represent the interests of EAs and increase the professional development of its members.\n\nEAs are not required to get college degrees. Some former IRS employees with five years of taxation experience may apply to become an enrolled agent without taking the exam. Non-exempt persons must take and pass the Special Enrollment Examination (SEE).

Enrolled agents offertax planning, tax preparation, and representation services for businesses and individuals.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nEnrolled agents are required to prove their proficiency in every aspect of taxes, ethics, and representation, unlike CPAs and attorneys, who may not specialize in taxes.\n\nEAs are not employees of the IRS. In addition, they cannot display their credentials when representing clients and advertising their services. They cannot use the term certified as part of a title or infer an employee relationship with the IRS.\n\nThe hiring of tax examiners is projected to decline 4%\u00a0from 2020 to 2030 as the growth of the tax examiner industry is closely tied to changes in federal, state, and local government budgets.The growth of the enrolled agent industry depends on industry rule changes and the demand for tax services. However, there is a growing need for EAs in private and public accounting firms, law firms, corporations, local and state government agencies, and banks.\n\nTo become an Enrolled agent, a person must obtain a preparer tax identification number, pass the Special Enrollment Exam, enroll as an agent, and be deemed suitable (e.g., background check) to perform as an Enrolled Agent.Former IRS employees with at least 5 years of experience as field tax professionals.\n\nAn Enrolled Agent is authorized by the U.S. federal government to represent taxpayers before the IRS.

However, an Enrolled Agent is specifically focused on taxation, whereas a CPA can specialize in taxation and other financial and accounting matters.
