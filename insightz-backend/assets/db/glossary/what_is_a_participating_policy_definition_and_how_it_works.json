  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA participating policy is an insurance contract that pays dividends to the policyholder. Dividends are generated from the profits of the insurance company that sold the policy and are typically paid out on anannual basisover the life of the policy.\n\nMost policies also include a final, or terminal, payment when the contract matures. An insurancedividendis not guaranteed and depends on the annual performance of the insurance company.A participating policy is also\u00a0referred to as a \"with-profits policy.\"\n\nParticipating policies are typicallylife insurancecontracts, such as a whole life participating policy. The dividend received by the policyholder can be taken in different ways: It can be used to pay the insurance premium; it can be left with the policy to generate interest like a regularsavings account; or the policyholder can take a cash payment like you'd get from a dividend stock.\n\nInsurance companies' premiums are based on a number of things, including expenses.\u00a0At first, non-participating policy premiums are usually lower than those for participating\u00a0policies because of the dividend expense: Participating policies charge more with the intent of returning the excess.\u00a0This has implications for the policy's tax treatment. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has classified the payments made by the insurance company as a return on excess premium.\n\nFor example, an insurance company will\u00a0base premiums on higheroperating costsand lower rates of return than are actually expected.\u00a0By operating from conservative projections, the\u00a0insurance company can\u00a0better protect against risk.\u00a0In the end, this\u00a0is better for the individual policyholder because it helps offset\u00a0their insurance company's\u00a0insolvency risk, resulting in lower long-termpremiums.\n\nParticipating policies are essentially a form of risk sharing, in which\u00a0the insurance company shifts a portion of risk to policyholders.\n\nThough the interest rates, mortality rates, and\u00a0expenses\u00a0that dividend formulas are based on change year to year, an\u00a0insurance company won't vary dividends that often.\u00a0Instead, it will alter dividend formulas periodically based on experience and anticipated future factors.\u00a0These\u00a0approaches apply towhole life insurance.Universal life insurancepolicy dividend rates can adjust much more frequently, even monthly.\n\nWhile more expensive at first, participating policies can end up costing less than non-participating policies over the long term.\u00a0Withcash value policies, the dividend will typically increase as the policy\u2019s cash value increases.\u00a0The owner of the participating policy would then have more cash value available to cover their ongoing premiums versus a nonparticipating policy.\n\nThe question of whether participating policies are better than nonparticipating policies is a complex one and depends largely on your needs.Term life insuranceis generally a nonparticipating policy with low premiums. It may suit you if you're interested in providing for your beneficiaries with lower or fewer premium payments.\n\nPermanent life insurance can be either participating or nonparticipating. A non-participating policy may charge a lower premium for the same amount of coverage at first. However, with this type of policy, the profits aren't shared and no dividends are paid to the policyholders.\n\nA participating policy likely will charge a higher premium at first. In exchange, it enables you as a policyholder to share the profits of the insurance company through regular dividends. This extra income could be used to reduce the long-term policy cost or build your savings, depending on your preference.\n\nThe type of insurance company you work with also matters.Mutual life insurancecompanies can only issue participating policies in most states.These policies allow a portion of the company's premiums to be paid out in the form of policy dividends as refunds, which makes those funds nontaxable as income.Alternatively, stock life insurance companies generally issue nonparticipating policies. They pay their profit dividends to their stock shareholders instead.\n\nA participating policy, also called a \"with-profit\" policy, enables a policyholder to share in the insurance company's profits in the form of a dividend. The dividend can be used to pay the insurance premium; it can be left with the policy to generate interest like in a regular\u00a0savings account; or the policyholder can take a cash payment like you can from a dividend stock. In non-participating policies the profits aren't shared and no dividends are paid to the policyholders.\n\nParticipating policies may cost more at first. Non-participating policy premiums are usually lower than those for participating\u00a0policies because of the dividend expense: The insurer charges more with the intent of returning the excess.\u00a0That's why life insurance dividends are tax free. The IRS classifies payments made by the insurance company as a return on excess premium, not as a dividend payout.\n\nYes, mutual life insurers are limited to offering only participating policies by most U.S. states. Their dividends are paid to policyholders regularly as refunds.\n\nA participating policy is an insurance contract that pays dividends to the policyholder. Dividends come from the issuing insurance company's profits, and are typically paid out on an annual basis over the life of the policy. Several factors should be considered to determine whether a participating life policy is right for you, but in many cases, they may be more expensive at first than non-participating policies. On the other hand, receiving dividends helps many holders of participating policies pay their premiums or build savings in the policy for later use.\n\nDundas Life. \"What Is Participating Life Insurance?\"\n\nMassMutual. \"What Goes Into Whole Life Insurance Dividends?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550 (2022), Investment Income and Expenses.\"\n\nTexas Department of Insurance. \"Life Insurance Guide.\"\n\nInsurance Information Institute. \"What are the Principal Types of Life Insurance?\"\n\nWisconsin State Legislature. \"Chapter 632 - Insurance Contracts in Specific Lines.\"\n\nEquitable. \"Common Questions About Life Insurance.\"\n\nAmerican Safety Council - Florida Insurance Licensing Association. \"1.5.2 Mutual Insurers.\"",
