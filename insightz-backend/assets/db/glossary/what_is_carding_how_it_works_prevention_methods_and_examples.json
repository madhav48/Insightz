  "term": "What Is Carding? How It Works, Prevention Methods, and Examples",
  "definition": "Carding is a form of fraud in which stolen credit or debit card information is used to purchase prepaid store-branded gift cards that are the equivalent of cash.\n\nThe stolen information or the gift cards can be sold to others to be used to purchase goods. Credit and debit card thieves who are involved in this type of fraud are called carders.\n\nCarding usually starts with a hacker gaining access to a store\u2019s or website\u2019scredit cardprocessing system. The hacker obtains a list of credit or debit cards that were recently used to make purchases. Hackers can exploit weaknesses in the security software intended to protect credit card accounts.\n\nIn other cases, hackers use a scanner to copy the coding from the magnetic strip on a physical card being used in a store.\n\nIn yet another method, credit card information is grabbed at the source by accessing theaccount holder\u2019spersonal information from a bank account.\n\nThe use of PINs and chips in newer cards have made it more difficult to use stolen cards in point-of-sale transactions. Card-not-present sales are now the primary source of theft.\n\nThe hacker sells the stolen credit or debit card numbers to a third party\u2014a carder\u2014who uses the stolen information to purchase a gift card.\n\nThe carding industry is run from carding forums. The sites are used to buy and sell stolen credit and debit card information. The sites also are used for money laundering.\n\nAccording to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, you \"generally\" have no liability for unauthorized use of your account number. If the physical card is stolen and you report it promptly, your liability is limited to $50.\n\nIf a physical credit card is stolen, and the owner reports the theft, consumer protection law limits the accountholder's liability to $50. If your card number is stolen and used fraudulently, you should have no liability, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBy the time the theft is noticed, a buyer has usually used the stolen information to buy high-value goods such as cell phones, televisions, and computers, as these goods do not require registration and can be resold later.\n\nA third party is often used to receive the goods and then ship them to other locations. This limits the carder\u2019s risk of drawing attention to themselves. The carder may also sell the goods on websites that offer a degree of anonymity to sellers and buyers.\n\nCarding relies on a quick turnaround. A major part of carding involves testing stolen cards to see if the cards still work or have been canceled.\n\nCarding comes with its own language. Here are a couple of the common terms:\n\nFullzis slang for \"full information.\"\n\nThe fullz package includes a person's real name, address, and form of identification. The information is sufficient for use in identity theft and financial fraud.\n\nA credit card dump is an unauthorized digital copy of the information on a credit card.\n\nIt can be obtained by copying the information from the physical card or hacking the issuer's payments network.\n\nAlthough the technique is not new, its scale has expanded tremendously in recent years, with some attacks involving millions of victims.\n\nCompanies are trying various strategies to stay ahead of carders. Some include requiring information at checkout that would not be available to the carder.\n\nAn address verification system (AVS) automatically compares the billing address supplied at checkout in an online purchase to the address on record with the credit card company.\n\nA properly functioning AVS system can stop transactions that don't match. For partial address matches, the seller has the discretion to accept or not accept the transaction.\n\nAVS is currently used in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAn IP geolocation system compares the IP location of the user's computer to the billing address entered on the checkout page. If they don't match, fraud may be indicated.\n\nThese incidents warrant further investigation since there are legitimate reasons, such as travel, for a buyer to be away from home.\n\nA card verification value (CVV) code is the three- or four-digit number on a credit card that adds an extra layer of security for making purchases when the buyer is not physically present.\n\nSince it is on the card itself, it is intended to verify that the person making a phone or online purchase has a physical copy of the card.\n\nIf your card number is stolen, a thief without aCVVwill have difficulty using it.\n\nThe CVV can be stored in the card's magnetic strip or in the card's chip. The seller submits the CVV with all other data as part of the transaction. The issuer can approve, refer, or decline transactions that fail CVV validation, depending on the issuer's procedures.\n\nMultifactor authentication (MFA) is a technology that requires two or more independent credentials to verify a user's login or other transaction. These may include a password plus an authenticator token or biometric data.\n\nUsing MFA creates a layered process that makes it difficult for an unauthorized person to access a target. MFA originally used onlytwo factors, but additional factors are becoming common.\n\nCAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is a security measure that requires the user to complete a test to prove he or she is a human and not hacking software.\n\nThe most commonly used CAPTCHA test asks the user to type a random series of numbers or letters displayed on the screen. Others require the user to spot and click on the anomaly in a group of pictures, such as the picture that doesn't include a motorcycle.\n\nThese challenges are designed to be easy for humans, but less so for computers.\n\nVelocity checks monitor the number of transactions attempted by the same card or site visitor within a given number of seconds or minutes.\n\nMost people do not make multiple payments in quick succession, especially when the payments are so rapid as to be beyond the capacity of a human being.\n\nVelocity can be monitored by dollar amount, user IP address, billing address, Bank Identification Number (BIN), and device.\n\nIn many cases, you will know that your information has been hacked only when an unauthorized purchase shows up in your credit card or debit card account. Your best practice is to keep an eye on your accounts and immediately report any unauthorized purchases to the company that issued the card.\n\nIn other cases, the theft occurred because you slipped up:\n\nUnfortunately, scammers have increasingly sophisticated tools at their disposal. They can even clone voices and alter images to make it appear that someone you trust needs help.\n\nA credit card skimmer is a device concealed inside a legitimate reader that records information used on the card. Gas pumps are notoriously targeted for this strategy. The FBI suggests that you pay inside or pick a pump in full view of the store, as it is less likely to have been targeted.\n\nCriminals can steal credit card and debit card information in various ways. They gain information through phishing scams, which trick people into giving up credit card or bank account information. They hack into computer systems at retailers, credit card issuers, and banks. They use skimmers, which are devices that steal credit and debit card information at physical locations where the cards are used.\n\nAll of this information winds up on online carder forums where it is sold to be used for unauthorized purchases.\n\nThese tricks generally work until the accountholder notices a suspicious charge and notifies the issuer.\n\nA carding attack is an attempt to place multiple orders on a website in rapid succession, using stolen credit or debit card information. It can be recognized by a sharp, sudden spike in orders, usually from the same shipping address. Luckily, these attempts can be spotted and stopped by security technology.\n\nIf you sell online, you can protect yourself from carding by using a fraud prevention method like CAPTCHA. If you're running a store in the real world, be on the lookout for signs of tampering with your card devices.\n\nCredit card and debit card information is stolen to facilitate various illicit schemes, including identity theft and money laundering.\n\nOne particularly pernicious form of credit card fraud is carding. This involves using stolen credit card and debit card account details to buy gift cards that can be used like cash. The process usually involves at least two parties, a thief who obtains the information and a buyer who purchases the information to use it.\n\nYou can minimize the threat by checking your account balances regularly and immediately reporting any unauthorized purchases. Stay alert to attempts to defraud you directly by tricking you into revealing information by phone, email, or text.\n\nSanta Clara High Technology Law Journal. \"Data Breaches: What the Underground World of Carding Reveals.\" Pages 380, 393.\n\nSanta Clara High Technology Law Journal. \"Data Breaches: What the Underground World of Carding Reveals.\"\n\nSanta Clara High Technology Law Journal. \"Data Breaches: What the Underground World of Carding Reveals.\" Pages 381-382.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Am I responsible for unauthorized charges if my credit cards are lost or stolen?\"\n\nSanta Clara High Technology Law Journal.\"Data Breaches: What the Underground World of Carding Reveals.\" Page 388.\n\nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. \"All Your Cards Are Belong to Us: Understanding Online Carding Forums.\" Page 2.\n\nSanta Clara High Technology Law Journal.\"Data Breaches: What the Underground World of Carding Reveals.\" Page 387.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Networks, Processors, and Issuers Payments Surveys (NPIPS).\" Pages 3, 9, 11.\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \"Minimizing Fraud.\"\n\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology. \"Multi-Factor Authentication.\"\n\nU.S. Payments Forum. \"Velocity Checks.\"\n\nConsumer Finance Protection Bureau. \"What are some classic warning signs of possible frauds or scams?\"\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation. \"Skimming.\"\n\nScandiweb. \"Store Under Carding Attack?
