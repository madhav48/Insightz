  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA book runner, or bookrunner, is the primaryunderwriteror lead coordinator when aninvestmentbank issues new equity, debt, or securities instruments.\n\nThe book runner is the lead underwriting firm that runs or is in charge of\u00a0the books in investment banking. Book runners may also coordinate with others in order to mitigate their risk such as those that represent companies in large,leveraged buyouts(LBOs).\n\nBook runners are the lead underwriters involved in different parts of the financial industry includinginitial public offerings(IPOs) and LBOs. As such, they're also known in the industry as lead arrangers or lead managers. With IPOs, the book runner assesses a company's financials and current market conditions to arrive at the initial value and quantity of shares to be sold to private parties. While most often done during an IPO, book runners may also do this through asecondary offering.\n\nTo reduce its risk, the book runner syndicates with other underwriting firms for the issuance of the newequity, debt, or security. This is fairly common in the investment banking industry and is a temporary arrangement between entities. The book runner serves as lead\u00a0underwriter, working with other investment banks to establish anunderwriter\u00a0syndicate, thereby creating the initial sales force for the shares. These shares are then sold to institutional and retail clients.\u00a0These new shares carry a heftycommission\u2014as much as 6% to\u00a08%\u2014for the underwriter\u00a0syndicate, with the majority of shares held by the lead underwriter.\n\nA book runner often syndicates with other underwriting firms to reduce their risk.\n\nThe lead-left book runner, also called managing underwriter orsyndicatemanager, is listed first among the other underwriters participating in the issuance. The lead-left book runner\u00a0plays the most important role\u00a0in thetransactionand will typically assign parts of the new issue to other underwriting firms for placement while retaining the most significant portion for\u00a0themselves. This book runner's name is also the first bank to be listed on the prospectus, in the upper left-hand corner.\n\nBook runners also work with large, leveraged buyouts, which often involve multiple businesses. LBOs take place when a company makes anacquisitionusingborrowed capital. In these cases, the book runner represents one of the participating companies and coordinates with the other participating firms. One company generally takes the responsibility of running or managing the books, though more than one book runner\u2014also called a joint book runner\u2014can control a security issuance.\n\nIn thesecuritiesindustry, an underwriter represents a particular business entity, most often aninvestment bank. The underwriter guarantees that all documentation and reporting requirements are met. They also work with potential investors to market the upcoming offering and gauge public interest. An underwriting institution may offer guarantees regarding the amount of stock to be purchased. They may also buy securities to meet the minimum guarantee.\n\nA book runner performs the same duties as an underwriter while also coordinating the efforts of multiple involved parties and information sources. In this regard, the book runner functions as a central point for all information regarding the potential offering orissue. This\u00a0pivotal\u00a0position may allow the book runner and his associated firm to know\u00a0new information before it is widely known.\n\nDetermining the finaloffering priceis one of the biggest responsibilities of\u00a0an underwriter. First, the price determines the size of the proceeds to the issuer. Second, it determines how easily the underwriter can sell the securities to buyers.\n\nThe issuer and lead book runner usually work together to determine the price. Once they agree on a price for\u00a0the securities and theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC) makes the registration statement effective, the underwriters\u00a0call\u00a0the subscribers to confirm their orders. If demand is particularly high, the\u00a0underwriters and the issuer may raise the price and reconfirm the sale with\u00a0subscribers.\n\nOne responsibility of the book runner is to create abookcontaining\u00a0a working list. This is useful in tracking information about parties interested in participating in the new offering or issue. This information is used to help determine an opening price\u00a0for an\u00a0initial public offering as well as to gain insight into the level of interest expressed by potentialinvestors.\n\nBeing the lead underwriter for a stock offering, especially an IPO,\u00a0can bring a large payday if the market shows a high demand for the shares. The stock issuer will often allow the lead underwriter to create an over-allotment ofsharesif demand is high which can bring in even more money to the underwriting firm. This is called agreenshoe option.\n\nThere are substantial risks involved in underwriting stockofferings. For instance, any company could plummet in theopen marketonce public trading begins. This is why large investment banks look to conduct many diverse offerings in the course of a year. The more transactions and offerings take place, the more the risk is spread out between them instead of concentrated on the outcomes of a single company's offering.\n\nA leveraged buyout is when one company buys another using a large amount of borrowed money to fund the purchase. Often, the assets of the company being purchased are used as collateral for the loans taken out by the buyer.\n\nA book runner is responsible for the entire underwriting process during the an IPO or a leveraged buyout. A lead manager is responsible for finding buyers for an IPO and ensure there are no barriers to the sale. These roles are often filled by the same firm.\n\nUnderwriters are responsible for assessing risk during financial transactions and deciding whether they or the company they work for will assume that risk. Investment banks are one type of company that employs underwriters. Insurers and other financial institutions also employ underwriters. The entire underwriting department of an investment bank can serve as book runner.\n\nA book runner is the primary underwriter when an investment bank issues new equity, debt, or securities instruments.\u00a0They are the lead underwriting firm that runs or is in charge of\u00a0the books, for example during an IPO.\n\nThe book runner usually works with other investment banks to establish an underwriter syndicate, thereby creating the initial sales force for shares. This reduces risk but also decreases the share of profit that each part of the syndicate makes. However, because the book runner takes on the most responsibility during the offering, they also usually get the highest commission from the transaction.",
