  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nNet liquid assets are the liquid assets that remain after a company\u2019s immediate liabilities are deducted from them.\n\nLiquid assets include cash, marketable securities, and accounts receivables that can be readily converted to cash at their approximate current value. They reflect a company\u2019s financial condition. Net liquid assets can be determined by subtracting itscurrent liabilitiesfrom itsliquid assets. They're what's left.\n\nThe amount of net liquid assets is one of a few measures that gives a snapshot of the financial condition of a firm. Cash andmarketable securitiesare ready to deploy, while accounts receivables could be turned into cash within a short period of time, though perhaps not completely as there is typically a small percentage ofbad debtassociated with aged receivables.Inventorydoes not qualify as a liquid asset because it cannot be readily sold without a significant discount.\n\nCurrent liabilities mainly encompass accounts payable, accrued liabilities, income tax payable, and a current portion oflong-term debtfor the average company. Subtracting current liabilities from the above liquid assets shows the financial flexibility of a company to make a quick payment.\n\nHaving a strong net liquid asset position is important for a firm because it demonstrates that a firm is able to pay off its short-term obligations, such as paying suppliers and paying offshort-term debt. It also signifies that a company is able to make new investments, such as the purchase of equipment, without having to take onfinancing.\n\nCompanies that have a strong net liquid asset position are also better placed in times of economic downturns. They are in a position to weather the storm by relying on its liquid assets to continue paying its short-term obligations even if business is not booming.\n\nOn the other hand, a company that does not have a strong net liquid asset position and no significant revenues in an economic downturn will not be able to meet its obligations and may have to declarebankruptcy.\n\nHaving net liquid assets also makes it easier to receive financing from a bank as it demonstrates the ability of a company to pay off its loans, even in times of distress. This also results in usually receiving a betterinterest rateon a loan.\n\nThough having net liquid assets is a positive position to be in, having too many liquid assets is not the most beneficial use of cash, as it could be invested and earning a return elsewhere, rather than sitting idly in a bank account. Conversely, it can also be used to paydividendstoshareholders.\n\nThere is a fine balance that a company must strike between enough liquid assets and too many liquid assets. The general rule of thumb is that if a business has six months of liquid assets to meet short-term obligations and coveroperating expenses, it is in a good position financially.\n\nSay that XYZ Widgets, Incorporated has the following components on its balance sheet forcurrent assetsand current liabilities:\n\nNet liquid assets as of this date would be:\n\nThe negative net liquid position of the company may be a concern, but this situation is typical for a retailer. Still, it indicates that the company is not in the best financial position, particularly if the economy takes a turn for the worse.\n\nA liquid asset is an asset that can be easily and quickly converted into cash. Examples of liquid assets may include cash, cash equivalents, money market accounts, marketable securities, short-term bonds, and accounts receivable.\n\nNet liquid assets are important because a company consistently needs cash to meet its short-term obligations. Without cash, a company can't pay its bills to vendors or wages to employees. Liquid assets are also needed in case a short-term emergency arises that requires money to be spent.\n\nA liquid asset is an item of future economic benefit to a company that can easily be exchanged for cash. On the other hand, illiquid assets are more difficult to sell. Examples of illiquid assets would include real estate & land, vehicles, equipment & machinery, and certain over-the-counter (OTC) securities, among others.",
