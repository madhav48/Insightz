  "term": "Regulation T (Reg T): Definition of Requirement and Example",
  "definition": "Regulation T is a collection of provisions that govern investors' cash accounts and the amount of credit that brokerage firms and dealers may extend to customers for the purchase ofsecurities. According to Regulation T, an investor may borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of securities that can be bought using a loan from abrokeror dealer. The remaining 50% of the price must be funded with cash.\n\nBuying securities with borrowed money is commonly referred to asbuying on margin, which refers to assets that an investor must deposit with abroker-dealerto obtain a loan. Additionally, Regulation T promulgates payment rules on certain securities transactions made throughcash accounts.\n\nRegulation T, or Reg T, was established by the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve Systemto provide rules for extensions of credit by brokers and dealers and to regulate cash accounts. An investor who has a cash account cannot borrow funds from a broker-dealer and must pay the purchase price of securities with cash.\n\nMargin accounts, on the other hand, allow investors to obtain credit to fund a portion of their securities purchase. Because buying securities on credit can expose investors to sudden losses of a much larger magnitude compared to the same purchase using only cash, theFederal Reserve Boardstepped in and promulgated a rule that limited the borrowing to be no greater than 50% of the securities purchase price.\n\nThe 50% requirement is called theinitial marginbecause it establishes a minimum borrowing level at the time of purchase. Certain brokers may have stricter requirements, with levels above 50%.\n\nRegulation T limits the amount of credit an investor can get from their broker to buy securities on margin.\n\nWhile the primary goal of Regulation T was to govern margin, it also introduced transaction rules for cash accounts. Because it takes up to one day for securities transactions to settle and the cash proceeds to be delivered to the seller of securities, a situation can arise when an investor buys and sells the same securities before paying for them from the cash account. This is calledfreeriding, and it is prohibited by Reg T.\n\nIn such cases, the investor's broker must freeze the cash account for 90 days, requiring the investor to fund their securities purchases with cash on the date of the trade.\n\nAn investor who wishes to purchase securities using broker-dealer credit must apply for a margin account that grants borrowing privileges. When investors borrow money in their margin account, they must pay interest based on the rate schedule established by the broker-dealer.\n\nSuppose an investor wishes to obtain a loan from a brokerage firm to purchase 10 shares of a certain company with a price per share of $100, resulting in a total purchase of $1,000. Regulation T states that the investor can borrow no more than 50% of the purchase price, or $500, from the broker, while the remaining balance must be paid in cash.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: Trading in Cash Accounts.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Bulletin: Understanding Margin Accounts.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"New \u201cT+1\u201d Settlement Cycle \u2013 What Investors Need To Know: Investor Bulletin.\"",
