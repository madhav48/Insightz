  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA rights offering (rights issue) is a group of rights offered to existing shareholders to purchase additional stock shares, known as subscriptionwarrants, in proportion to their existing holdings.\u00a0These are considered to be a type of option since they give a company's stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company.\n\nIn a rights offering, the subscription price at which each share may be purchased is generally discounted relative to the current market price. Before the shareholder has paid for the new shares, they are known asnil-paid shares. Once they pay for the shares, they are referred to as fully paid rights. Rights are often transferable, allowing the holder to sell them in the open market.\n\nIn a rights offering, each shareholder receives the right to purchase a pro-rata allocation of additional shares at a specific price and within a specific period (usually 16 to 30 days).Shareholders, notably, are not obligated to exercise this right.\n\nA rights offering is effectively an invitation to existing shareholders to purchase additional newsharesin the company. More specifically, this type of issue gives existing shareholders\u00a0securities\u00a0called \"rights,\" which, well, give the shareholders the right to purchase new shares at a discount to themarket priceon a stated future date. The company is giving shareholders a chance to increase their\u00a0exposure\u00a0to the\u00a0stock\u00a0at a discount price.\n\nBut until the date at which the new shares can be purchased, shareholders may trade the rights on the market the same way that they would tradeordinary shares. The rights issued to a shareholder have value, thus compensating current shareholders for the future\u00a0dilution\u00a0of their existing shares' value. Dilution occurs because a\u00a0rights offering spreads a company\u2019s net profit over a wider number of shares. Thus, the company\u2019s earnings per share, or EPS, decreases as the allocated earnings result in share dilution.\n\nThere are two general types of rights offerings: direct rights offerings and insured/standby rights offerings.\n\nIn some cases, rights issued are not transferable. These are known as \"non-renounceable rights.\"\u00a0In other cases, the beneficiary of a rights issue may sell them to another party.\n\nCompanies generally offer rights when they need to raise money. Examples include when there is a need to pay off debt, purchase equipment, or acquire another company. In some cases, a company may use a rights offering to raise money when there are no other viable financing alternatives.\n\nOther significant benefits of a rights offering are that the issuing company can bypassunderwriting fees, there is no shareholder approval needed, and market interest in the issuer's common stock generally peaks. For existing shareholders, rights offerings present the opportunity to purchase additional shares at a discount.\n\nSometimes, rights offerings present disadvantages to the issuing company and existing shareholders.\u00a0Shareholders may disapprove because of their concern withdilution.\u00a0The offering may result in more concentrated investor positions.\n\nThe issuing company, in an attempt to raise capital, may find that additional required filings and procedures associated with the rights offering are too costly and time-consuming; the costs of the rights offering may outweigh the benefits(cost-benefit principle).\n\nThe main reason to do a rights offering is to raise capital. The capital can be used to expand the business or pay down existing debt, or any other need. Companies may issue rights offerings to existing shareholders as a benefit to shareholders as well as a way to avoid the time-consuming and costly process of underwriting and releasing more shares to the public.\n\nRights offerings dilute the value of existing shares because more shares have been released through the rights offering. This can harm the stock price, as well as the fact that a rights offering can be associated with companies that are struggling financially, so investor confidence is diminished, reducing the stock price.\n\nExisting shareholders are not obligated to purchase additional stock through a rights offering; the offering simply offers them a chance to purchase more stock.\n\nRights offerings are additional shares of company stock offered to existing shareholders who are not obligated to buy the additional shares. The shares are offered at a discount, which is an incentive used to entice shareholders to buy stock. Companies issue rights offerings in order to raise capital for various reasons.",
