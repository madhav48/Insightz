  "term": "Simple Moving Average (SMA): What It Is and the Formula",
  "definition": "A simple moving average (SMA) calculates the average price of an asset, usually using closing prices, during a specified period of days.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA simple moving average (SMA) is an arithmeticmoving averagecalculated by adding recent prices and then dividing that figure by the number of time periods in the calculation average. For example, one could add the closing price of a security for a number of time periods and then divide this total by that same number of periods. Short-term averages respond quickly to changes in the price of the underlying security, while long-term averages are slower to react. There are other types of moving averages, including theexponential moving average(EMA) and theweighted moving average(WMA).\n\nSMA=A1+A2+...+Annwhere:An=the\u00a0price\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0asset\u00a0at\u00a0periodnn=the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0total\u00a0periods\\begin{aligned} &\\text{SMA}=\\dfrac{A_1 + A_2 + ... + A_n}{n} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &A_n=\\text{the price of an asset at period } n\\\\ &n=\\text{the number of total periods}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bSMA=nA1\u200b+A2\u200b+...+An\u200b\u200bwhere:An\u200b=the\u00a0price\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0asset\u00a0at\u00a0periodnn=the\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0total\u00a0periods\u200b\n\nFor example, this is how you would calculate the simple moving average of a security with the following closing prices over a 15-day period.\n\nWeek One (5 days): 20, 22, 24, 25, 23\n\nWeek Two (5 days): 26, 28, 26, 29, 27\n\nWeek Three (5 days): 28, 30, 27, 29, 28\n\n20 + 22 + 24 + 25 + 23 + 26 + 28 + 26 + 29 + 27 + 28 + 30 + 27 + 29 + 28 = 392\n\nThe 15-day simple moving average for this security would be $26.13.\n\nA 10-day moving average would average out theclosing pricesonly the most recent 10 days rather than using all 15. Each day when the stock market closes, there is a new most recent closing price. This replaces the oldest one being used, and a new, up-to-date moving average is calculated. A 50-day moving average would use 50 days worth of data to compute the average price on a rolling basis.\n\nA simple moving average is customizable because it can be calculated for different numbers of time periods. This is done by adding the closing price of the security for a number of time periods and then dividing this total by the number of time periods, which gives the average price of the security over the time period.\n\nA simple moving average smooths out volatility and makes it easier to view the price trend of a security. If the simple moving average points up, this means that the security's price is increasing. If it is pointing down, it means that the security's price is decreasing. The longer the time frame for the moving average, the smoother the simple moving average. A shorter-term moving average is more volatile, but its reading is closer to the source data.\n\nOne of the most popular simple moving averages is the 200-day SMA. However, there is a danger to following the crowd. AsThe Wall Street Journalexplains, since thousands of traders base their strategies around the 200-day SMA, there is a chance that these predictions could become self-fulfilling and limit price movements.\n\nMoving averages are an important analytical tool used to identify current price trends and the potential for a change in an established trend. The simplest use of an SMA in technical analysis is using it to quickly determine if an asset is in an uptrend or downtrend.\n\nAnother popular, albeit slightly more complex, analytical use is to compare a pair of simple moving averages with each covering different time frames. If a shorter-term simple moving average is above a longer-term average, an uptrend is expected. On the other hand, if the long-term average is above a shorter-term average then a downtrend might be the expected outcome.\n\nTwo popular trading patterns that use simple moving averages include the death cross and a golden cross. Adeath crossoccurs when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA. This is considered a bearish signal, indicating that further losses are in store. Thegolden crossoccurs when a short-term SMA breaks above a long-term SMA. Reinforced by high trading volumes, this can signal further gains are in store.\n\nIncontrasting an exponential moving average (EMA) and a simple moving averagethe major difference is the sensitivity each one shows to changes in the data used in its calculation. More specifically, the\u00a0EMA gives a higher weighting to recent prices,\u00a0while\u00a0the SMA assigns an equal weighting to all values.\n\nThe two averages are similar because they are interpreted in the same manner and are both commonly used by technical traders to smooth out price fluctuations. Since EMAs place a higher weighting on recent data than on older data, they are more reactive to the latestprice changesthan SMAs are, which makes the results from EMAs more timely and explains why the EMA is the preferred average among many traders.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not more emphasis should be placed on the most recent days in the time period or on more distant data. Many traders believe that new data will better reflect\u00a0the current trend the security is moving with. At the same time, other traders feel that privileging certain dates over others will bias the trend. Therefore, the SMA may rely too heavily on outdated data since it treats the10th or 200th day's impactthe same as the first or second day's.\n\nSimilarly, the SMA relies wholly on historical data. Many people (including some economists) believe thatmarkets are efficient. This is known as the efficient market hypothesis. It holds that current market prices already reflect all available information. If markets are indeed efficient, using historical data should tell us nothing about the future direction of asset prices. There are some economic and financial thinkers who support this hypothesis, and plenty of others who oppose it.\n\nTraders use simple moving averages (SMAs) to chart the long-term trajectory of a stock or other security, while ignoring thenoiseof day-to-dayprice movements. This allows traders to compare medium- and long-term trends over a larger time horizon. For example, if the 50-day SMA of a security falls below its 200-day SMA, this is usually interpreted as a bearish death cross pattern and a signal of further declines. The opposite pattern, the golden cross, indicates potential for a market rally.\n\nTo calculate a simple moving average, the sum of the prices within a time period is divided by the number of prices. For instance, consider shares of Tesla closed at $10, $11, $12, $11, $14 over a five day period. The simple moving average of Tesla\u2019s shares for this 5-day period would equal $10 + $11 + $12 + $11 + $14 divided by 5, which equals $11.6.\n\nWhile a simple moving average gives equal weight to each of the values within a time period, an exponential moving average places greater weight on recent prices. Exponential moving averages are typically seen as a more timely indicator of a price trend, and because of this, many traders prefer using this over a simple moving average. Common short-term exponential moving averages include the 12-day and 26-day. The 50-day and 200-day exponential moving averages are used to indicate long-term trends.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \"Does Chart Analysis Really Work?\"",
