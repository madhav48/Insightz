  "term": "Qualitative Analysis",
  "definition": "Qualitative analysis explores a company\u2019s nonnumerical data, helping it understand its value or prospects.\n\nIn business and management, qualitative analysis uses subjective judgment to analyze a company\u2019s value or prospects based on nonquantifiable information, such as management expertise, industry cycles, strength of research and development, and labor relations.\n\nQualitative analysis contrasts withquantitative analysis, which focuses on numbers found in reports such as balance sheets. The two techniques, however, will often be used together to examine a company\u2019s operations and evaluate its potential as an investment opportunity.\n\nPaige McLaughlin / Investopedia\n\nThe distinction between qualitative and quantitative approaches is similar to the difference between human and artificial intelligence. Quantitative analysis uses exact inputs such as profit margins,debt ratios, earnings multiples, and the like. These can be plugged into a computerized\u00a0model to yield an exact result, such as thefair valueof a stock or a forecast for earnings growth. Of course, for the time being, a human has to write the program that crunches these numbers, and that involves a fair degree of subjective judgment. Once they are programmed, though, computers can perform quantitative\u00a0analysis in fractions of a second, while it might take even the most gifted and highly trained humans minutes or hours.\n\nQualitative analysis, on the other hand, deals with intangible, inexact concerns that belong to the social and experiential realm rather than the mathematical one. This approach depends on the kind of intelligence that machines currently lack, since things like positive associations with a brand, management trustworthiness, customer satisfaction,competitive advantage, and cultural shifts are difficult, arguably impossible, to capture with numerical inputs.\n\nManysocial scientistsuse qualitative analysis in their research, and it is especially prominent among anthropologists and sociologists.\n\nQualitative analysis may sound almost like \u201clistening to your gut,\u201d and indeed, many qualitative analysts would argue that gut feelings have their place in the process. This does not mean, however, that it is not a rigorous approach. Indeed, it can consume much more time and energy than quantitative analysis.\n\nPeople are central to qualitative analysis. An investor might start by getting to know acompany\u2019s management, including their educational and professional backgrounds. One of the most important factors is their experience in the industry. More abstractly, do they have a record of hard work and prudent decision making, or are they better at knowing\u2014or being related to\u2014the right people? Their reputations are also key: Do their colleagues and peers respect them? Their relationships with business partners are also worth exploring, since these can have a direct impact on operations.\n\nThe way employees view the company and its management is important. Are they satisfied and motivated, or do they resent their bosses? The rate of employee turnover can indicate employees\u2019 loyalty or lack thereof. What doesworkplace culturesay about the company? Overly hierarchical offices promote intrigue and competition and sap productive energy; a sleepy, unmotivated environment can mean employees are mainly concerned with punching the clock. The ideal is a vibrant, creative culture that attracts top talent.\n\nGathering data for qualitative analysis can sometimes be difficult. Fortune 500 CEOs are not known for sitting down with retail investors for a chat or showing them around the corporate headquarters. In part,Warren Buffettcan use qualitative analysis so effectively because people are willing to give him access to their time and information. The rest of us have to sift through news reports and companies\u2019 filings to get a sense of managers\u2019 records, strategies, and philosophies.\n\nThemanagement discussion and analysis (MD&A)section of a company\u2019s10-Kfiling andquarterly earnings conference callsprovide a window into strategies and communication styles. Clear, transparent communication and coherent strategies are useful. Buzzwords, evasiveness, and short-termism, not so much.\n\nQualitative data can also be collected in a number of other ways, including interviews, panel groups, ethnography (participant observation), archival work, and document analysis. Qualitative data is often read carefully and coded thematically to identify themes, patterns, and trends.\n\nCustomers are the only group more crucial to a company\u2019s success than management and employees, since they are the source of itsrevenue. Ironically, if a company places customers\u2019 interests before shareholders, it may be a better long-term investment. If feasible, it\u2019s a good idea to try being a customer. Say you\u2019re considering investing in an airline that has reined in costs, beatearnings estimatesin three consecutive quarters, and plans tobuy back shares. When you try to actually use the airline, however, you find the website bug-ridden, the customer service representatives cranky, the extra fees petty, and your fellow passengers resentful. The negative experience tells you that the company has a lack of priority for its customers and to be careful investing in the airline.\n\nA company\u2019sbusiness modeland competitive advantage are vital components of qualitative analysis. What gives the firm an enduring leg up over its rivals? Has it invented a new technology that competitors will find hard to replicate, or that hasintellectual propertyprotection? Does it have a unique problem-solving approach for its customers? Is its brand globally recognized\u2014in a good way? Does its product have cultural resonance or an element of nostalgia? Will there still be a market for it in 20 years? If you can plausibly imagine another company stepping in and doing what this one does just a little bit better, then thebarrier to entrymay be too low. Why will an unestablished company be the one to create or disrupt its chosen market, and why won\u2019t it then be replaced in turn?\n\nThe idea behind quantitative analysis is to measure things; the idea behind qualitative analysis is to understand them. The latter requires a holistic view and a fact-based overarching narrative. Context is key. For example, aCEOwho dropped out of college would be a red flag in some cases, butMark ZuckerbergandSteve Jobsare exceptions.\u00a0Silicon Valley is, for better or worse, a different beast. A look at McDonald\u2019s Corp. (MCD) financials a few years ago would have told you nothing about a looming backlash against cheap, unhealthy\u00a0food. On the other hand, a purely qualitative approach is vulnerable to distortion by\u00a0blind spots and personal biases. Quantitative measures can act as a check on these tendencies.\n\nQualitative analysis relies on thick description and deep understanding of the subject being researched, obtained from in-depth interviews, observations, and/or close readings of text. This type of research typically looks at case studies and can be used to understand local phenomena.\n\nQuantitative analysis instead relies on the statistical analyses of numerical data obtained from surveys, experiments, or administrative records. From this, inferences can be made and correlations between variables analyzed to understand more generalized phenomena.\n\nAlthough the exact steps may vary, most researchers and analysts undertaking qualitative analysis will follow these steps:\n\nQualitative research encompasses a wide range of techniques and methodologies. The most common include:\n\nQualitative data can take many forms. Common types include transcripts generated from one-on-one interviews, free text responses on surveys, narratives, quotations, text documents, images, or observations taken down in a notebook or research journal.\n\nQualitative analysis can be applied to a wide range of research topics or practical settings. It is best used if you are interested in understanding human behavior from an informant or participant perspective to get a better understanding of what is going on in the social context around you.",
