  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nCreating a retirement plan begins with determining your long-term financial goals and tolerance for risk, and then starting to take action to reach those goals. The process can begin anytime during your working years, but the earlier, the better.\n\nThe process of creating a retirement plan includes identifying your income sources, adding up your expenses, putting a savings plan into effect, and managing your assets. By estimating your future cash flows, you can judge whether your retirement income goal is realistic.\n\nNeedless to say, a retirement plan is not a static document. You\u2019ll need to update it from time to time as well as review it to monitor your progress.\n\nA retirement plan is your preparation for a good life after you\u2019re done working to pay the bills or at least done working a full-time job. But it\u2019s not all about money.\n\nThe non-financial aspects include lifestyle choices such as how you want to spend your time in retirement and where you\u2019ll live. A holistic approach to retirement planning considers all these areas.\n\nThe goals for your retirement plan will change in focus over time:\n\nSome retirement plans change depending on where you are. The United States andCanadaeach have unique systems of workplace-sponsored plans.\n\nYour magic number, which is theamount you need to retire comfortably, is highly personalized. But there are rules of thumb that can give you an idea of how much to save.\n\nYour post-retirement expenses largely determine that \u201cmagic number.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a good idea tocreate a retirement budget, calculating estimated costs for housing, health insurance, food, clothing, and transportation.\n\nAnd since you\u2019ll have more free time on your hands, you may also want to factor in the cost of entertainment, hobbies, and travel.\n\nIt may be hard to come up with concrete figures, but a reasonable estimate will be helpful.\n\nRegardless of where you are in life, several keysteps apply to almost everyoneduring their retirement planning. The following are some of the most common:\n\nA retirement plan may be seen as a road map to a comfortable life after work. It entails accumulating enough money to pay for the lifestyle you want to enjoy in the future. Your retirement plan may well change over time, but the earlier you get started, the better.\n\nTax-advantaged retirement savings plans have become the keystone of long-term savings for Americans. You should have access to one or more of these plans depending on how you earn a living. Each has its own rules and regulations.\n\nMost large companies offer their employees401(k)plans. Nonprofit employers have similar403(b)plans.\n\nAn upfront benefit of thesequalified retirement plansis that your employer has the option to match what you invest up to a certain amount. For example, if you contribute 3% of your annual income to your plan account, your employer may match that amount, depositing the sum into your retirement account along with your contribution.\n\nYou can contribute more than the amount that will earn the employer match. Some experts recommend contributing upward of 10%.\n\nThe maximum is revised yearly by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Participants can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024 ($23,500 in 2025) to a 401(k) or 403(b), some of which may be added to with anemployer match.People age 50 and older can contribute an extra $7,500 per year as acatch-up contributionin 2024 and 2025. Those aged 60 to 63 can now make a catch-up contribution of $11,250 in 2025.\n\nThese accounts can earn a much higher rate of return than a savings account (although the investments are not risk-free). The funds in the account, if it is a traditional account rather than a Roth account, are not taxed until you withdraw them. Since your contributions are taken off your gross income, you will get an immediate income tax break.\n\nThose who are on the cusp of a higher tax bracket might consider contributing enough to lower theirtax liability.\n\nThe traditionalindividual retirement account (IRA)is similar to a 401(k) plan, but it can be obtained at virtually any bank or brokerage. It is primarily for self-employed people and others who have no access to a 401(k), but anyone with earned income can invest in an IRA.\n\nThe money you save in an IRA is deducted from your income for the year, lowering your taxable income and, therefore, your tax liability.\n\nThe tax benefit to this kind of account is upfront. So when it comes time to take distributions from the account, you are subject to your standard tax rate at that time. Keep in mind, though, that the money grows on a tax-deferred basis. There are nocapital gainsor dividend taxes that are assessed on the balance of your account until you begin making withdrawals.\n\nThe IRS sets limits on how much you can contribute to a traditional IRA each year. The limit for 2024 and 2025 is $7,000. People who are 50 and older can invest an additional $1,000 for a total of $8,000 in 2024 and 2025.\n\nDistributionsmust be taken at age 73 and can be taken as early as 59\u00bd. You will owe taxes on the withdrawal at your regular income tax rate for that year.\n\nARoth IRAis funded with post-tax dollars. This is a great variation on the IRA, with a little more pain upfront for a lot of gain down the road.\n\nThe Roth IRA eliminates the immediate tax deduction of the traditional IRA. The money you pay into it is taxed in that year.\n\nHowever, you should owe no taxes when you start withdrawing money, either on the amount you put in or the investment gains it accrued.\n\nStarting a Roth IRA early can pay off big time in the long run, even if you don\u2019t have a lot of money to invest at first. Remember, the longer the money sits in a retirement account, the more tax-free interest is earned.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 contribution limit for either IRA (Roth or traditional) is $7,000 a year, or $8,000 if you are age 50 or older. A Roth has other restrictions, related to income. For instance:\n\nNote that the income limits are higher for married couples filing jointly.\n\nAs with a 401(k), a Roth IRA has some penalties associated with taking money outbefore you hit retirement age. But there are a few notable exceptions that may be useful in an emergency. First, you can always withdraw the money you invested (but not the gains it earned) without paying a penalty.\n\nTheSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAis a retirement account available toemployees of small businesses. It\u2019s an alternative to the 401(k), which is expensive for an employer to manage. It works the same way a 401(k) does, allowing employees to save money automatically through payroll deductions with the option of an employer match.\n\nThis amount is capped at 3% of an employee\u2019s annual salary. The annual contribution limit for a SIMPLE IRA is $16,000 in 2024 and $16,500 in 2025. Catch-up contributions of $3,500 allow employees 50 or older to bump that limit up to $19,500 in 2024 and $20,000 in 2025.\n\nOnce you set up a retirement account, the question becomes where to invest the money. You will be offered a choice, usually among mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Many also offer target-date funds, which automatically alter your selections over time, allocating more money toward conservative choices as you approach retirement age.\n\nBelow are some guidelines for successful retirementplanning at different stagesof your life.\n\nThose embarking on adult life may not have a lot of money free to invest, but they do have time to letinvestments mature, which is a critical piece of retirement savings. This is the principle of compounding.\n\nCompound interest allows interest to earn interest, and the more time you have, the more interest you will earn. If you can only put aside $50 a month, it will be worth three times more if you invest it at age 25 than if you wait to start investing until age 45,thanks to the joys of compounding.\n\nYou might be able to invest more money in the future, but you\u2019ll never be able to make up for that lost time.\n\nSome federal agencies and uniformed services offerthrift savings plans.\n\nEarly midlife tends to bring financial strains, including mortgages, student loans, insurance premiums, and credit card debt.\n\nStill, it\u2019s critical to continue saving at this stage of retirement planning. The combination of earning more money and the time you still have to invest and earn interest makes these years some of the best for aggressive savings.\n\nPeople at this stage of retirement planning should continue to take advantage of any 401(k) matching programs that their employers offer. They should also try to max out contributions to a 401(k) or Roth IRA (you can have both at the same time). For those ineligible for a Roth IRA, consider atraditional IRA. As with your 401(k), this is funded with pretax dollars, and the assets within it grow tax-deferred.\n\nSome employer-sponsored plans offer a Roth option to set aside after-tax retirement contributions. You are limited to the same annual limit, but there areno income limitationsas with a Roth IRA.\n\nFinally, don\u2019t neglect life insurance and disability insurance. You want to ensure that your family can survive financially without pulling from retirement savings should something happen to you.\n\nAs you approach retirement, your investment accounts should become more conservative. Treasury bills (T-bills) are one of the most conservative investments, although their returns are also low compared to other investments.\n\nPeople in this age group have a few advantages. These often include higher wages as well as more disposable income than younger savers.\n\nIt\u2019s never too lateto set up and contribute to a 401(k) or an IRA. One benefit of this retirement planning stage is catch-up contributions. From age 50 on, you can contribute an additional $1,000 in 2024 and 2025 to your traditional or Roth IRA and an additional $7,500 a year to your 401(k) in 2024 and 2025.\n\nThose who have maxed out their tax-incentivized retirement savings options can consider other forms of investment to supplement their retirement savings. Certificates of deposit (CDs), blue-chip stocks, or real estate investments (like a vacation home that you rent out) can be reasonably safe ways to add to your nest egg.\n\nYou can also begin to get a sense of what yourSocial Security benefitswill be and at what age it makes sense to start taking them. Eligibility for early benefits starts at age 62, but the retirement age for full benefits is 66.\n\nThis is the time to look into long-term care insurance, which will help cover the costs of a nursing home or home care should you need it in your advanced years. If you don\u2019t properly plan for health-related expenses, especially unexpected ones, they can decimate your savings.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) offers anonline calculatorto estimate your eventual monthly payment.\n\nRetirement planning includes a lot more than simply how much you will save and how much you need. It takes into account your complete financial picture.\n\nFor most Americans, the single biggest asset they own is their home. How does that fit into your retirement plan?\n\nA home was considered an asset in the past, but since the housing market crash, planners see it as less of an asset than they once did. With the popularity of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), many homeowners areentering retirement in mortgage debtinstead of well above water.\n\nOnce you retire, there\u2019s also the question of whether you should sell your home and downsize. If you still live in the home where you raised a family, it might be bigger and costlier than you need or want.\n\nYour retirement plan should include an unbiased look at your home and what to do with it.\n\nYourestate planaddresses what happens to your assets after you die. It should include awillthat lays out your plans.\n\nBut even before that, you should set up a trust or use some other strategy to keep as much of it as possible shielded from estate taxes.\n\nAs of 2024, the first\u00a0$13.61 million of an estate is exempt fromestate taxes($13.99 million in 2025), but many people are finding ways to leave their money to their children in a way that doesn\u2019t pay them in a lump sum.\n\nOnce you reach retirement age and begin taking distributions, taxes become a bigger problem. Most of your retirement accounts are taxed as ordinary income tax.\n\nThat\u2019s one good argument for considering a Roth IRA or a Roth 401(k), as both allow you to pay taxes upfront rather than upon withdrawal.\n\nIf you believe you will have a higher taxable income later in life, it may make sense to do a Roth conversion. An accountant or financial planner can help you work through such tax considerations.\n\nMedical expenses tend to increase with age. You will have government-sponsoredMedicarecoverage at a modest cost to you, but many supplement its coverage with a Medicare Advantage orMedigappolicy.\n\nYour choices are many and complex. It\u2019s a good idea to start checking out your options well in advance of retiring.\n\nRetirement planning isn\u2019t difficult. It\u2019s as easy as setting aside some money every month\u2014and every little bit counts.\n\nYou can start with a tax-advantaged savings plan, either a 401(k) through an employer or an IRA through a bank or brokerage firm.\n\nYou may also want to consider talking to a professional, such as a financial planner or investment broker who can steer you in the right direction.\n\nThe earlier you start, the better. That\u2019s because your investments grow over time by earning interest. And you\u2019ll earn interest on that interest.\n\nA retirement plan helps yousock away enough money to maintain the same lifestyleyou currently have after you retire. While you may work part-time or pick up the odd gig here or there, it probably won\u2019t be enough to sustain your current lifestyle. Social Security benefits will only take you so far. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to have a viable long-term plan for a financially comfortable retirement.\n\nA retirement plan is about accumulating enough money to enable you to enjoy a comfortable life after work. There are a couple of key issues to keep in mind:\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to a 401(k), you have a few options. You could open an individual retirement account (IRA); however, the contribution limit for IRAs is much lower than for 401(k)s: $7,000 versus $23,000 in 2024 ($7,000 versus $23,500 in 2025), respectively. There\u2019s also thesolo 401(k)for self-employed workers. You might consider an annuity, but be careful: They\u2019re typically illiquid and come with high fees. You can also put money in a brokerage account, though this won\u2019t benefit from the tax advantages of the accounts listed above.\n\nEveryone dreams of the day they can finally say goodbye to the workforce. But doing so costs money. That\u2019s where retirement planning comes into play. It doesn\u2019t matter at what point you are in your life. Setting aside money now means you\u2019ll have less to worry about later.\n\nGovernment of Canada. \u201cRegistered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Limit Increases to $23,500 for 2025, IRA Limit Remains $7,000.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cMaximize Your Salary Deferrals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 550, Investment Income and Expenses.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 557, Additional Tax on Early Distributions from Traditional and Roth IRAs.\u201d\n\nThrift Savings Plan. \u201cHomepage.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \u201cSavings Fitness: A Guide to Your Money and Your Financial Future,\u201d Page 6 (Page 10 of PDF).\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plans FAQs on Designated Roth Accounts.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \u201cSavings Fitness: A Guide to Your Money and Your Financial Future,\u201d Page 9 (Page 13 of PDF).\n\nSocial Security Administration. \u201cRetirement Benefits.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u2014Estate and Gift Tax.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRoth Comparison Chart.\u201d",
