  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe term personal guarantee refers to an individual\u2019s legal promise to repaycreditissued to a business for which they serve as an executive or partner. Providing a personal guarantee means that if the business becomes unable to repay thedebt, the individual assumes personal responsibility for the balance. Personal guarantees provide an extra level of protection to credit issuers who want to make sure they will be repaid.\n\nPersonal guarantees are used in credit deals to secure funding for businesses. They are used by new andsmall businesses\u2014generally, for companies that may not be as established or for those with inadequatecredit historyto qualify for loans and other credit on their own. When a personal guarantee is given, the principals of the company pledge their own assets and agree to repay a debt from personal capital in case the company defaults. In short, the business owner or principal becomes acosigneron the credit application.\n\nHere's how it works. Lenders may require business owners or executives to provide a personal guarantee in order to access credit if the company is too new or has a bad credit history. The businessprincipalincludes their own credit history and profile as part of the credit application which forms the primary basis for underwriting. When a personal guarantee is used, the applicant includes their Social Security Number (SSN) for a hard credit inquiry as well as details about the individual\u2019s personal income. This information is in addition to the company'semployer identification number(EIN) and financial statements.\n\nAn executive may also pledge their own personalassets\u2014checking accounts, savings accounts, cars, and real estate\u2014and agree to repay a debt from personal capital in case the companydefaultsas part of their personal guarantee. Not only does this make credit more accessible to businesses, but it also mitigates theriskto creditors since they have a legal claim to the individual's personal assets. It also improves the terms which will be based on the profile of both the business and the individual in theunderwritingprocess.\n\nSmall business owners and executives normally make a substantial initial investment using their owncapital. That's one of the reasons why they offer personal guarantees to get credit\u2014because they have a vested interest in the launch and development of their businesses. As such, businesses may be required to pay creditors monthly installment payments rather than generating a return forequityinvestors.\n\nAlthough well-established businesses with significantcommercial creditprofiles may be able to obtain credit without a personal guarantee, they may still use them in their applications. Credit with a personal guarantee can be a low-cost way for a business to obtain funds. But if the business isn't able to generate enoughrevenueand earnings, an individual could suffer significant losses. Remember, if a personal guarantee is used, the principal is personallyliableif a default occurs. It gives creditors a legal right to all of an individual's pledged personal assets.\n\nTheNew York Timesreport on former President Trump's taxes indicates that he took this route, personally guaranteeing \"loans and other debts totaling $421 million\" by 2018.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff This provided a benefit, as well\u2014taking responsibility enables a business owner to use those losses to offset current and future taxes they owe.\n\nHaving said this, business owners should be especially careful when they apply for credit as terms may require a personal guarantee. Applicants should look for language in thecredit applicationsuch as \u201cyou, as an individual and the authorizing officer of the company...are agreeing to be jointly and severally liable with the company for all charges to the account.\u201d\n\nMany private lenders require personal guarantees before they advance any credit to certain types of businesses. What many people may not realize is that theSmall Business Administration(SBA) also requires principals to offer personal guarantees in order to get an SBA loan. Anyone with an interest in a business of 20% or more must provide the SBA with an unconditional personal guarantee.These loans are backed by the SBA but are issued by the administration's lending partners.\n\nThe Small Business Administration requires a personal guarantee from anyone with an interest of 20% or more in a company.\n\nThere are two common types of personal guarantees\u2014limited and unlimited. Limited guarantees allow lenders to collect a certain amount of money or a certain percentage of the outstanding balance from a principal or business owner. These guarantees are common when there are multiple principals who can pay a certain portion of the debt. For instance, if a business defaults on its loan, thelendercan go after each principal for 25% of the balance.\n\nUnlimited guarantees, however, require that the principal is liable for the full outstanding balance. Personal guarantees required by the SBA are considered unlimited guarantees. So if a business can't fulfill its obligations on a loan with a personal guarantee, the lender can go after the principal to recoup the full outstanding balance. If there aren't enoughliquid assetsavailable\u2014through checking and other, similar accounts\u2014the lender can seize other assets such asreal estateor vehicles.\n\nNew York Times. \"Long-Concealed Records Show Trump's Chronic Losses and Years of Tax Avoidance.\" Accessed Feb. 4, 2021.\n\nSBA. \"Unconditional Guarantee.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.",
