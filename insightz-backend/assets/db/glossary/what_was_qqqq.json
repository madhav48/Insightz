  "term": "What Was QQQQ?",
  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nQQQQ was the original\u00a0ticker symbol for the\u00a0Invesco QQQ Trust, anETFthat trades on the Nasdaq exchange. This security offered broad exposure to the tech sector by tracking theNasdaq 100 Index. The ticker QQQQ has since been replaced with its current ticker symbol, QQQ which it adopted in March 2011.\n\nQQQQ\u00a0no longer exists as a ticker symbol, having been shortened to QQQ in 2011. The exchange-traded fund is known officially as\u00a0the Invesco QQQ Trust and was launched in 1999.QQQ still tracks the Nasdaq 100, a stock index listing the 100 largest Nasdaq companies by market cap. The Nasdaq 100 Index comprises companies from all sectors, with the exception of financial services.These industries include consumer discretionary, industrial, technology, health care, and others.\n\nThe current replacement of the ETF provides an especially viable investment choice for investors seeking\u00a0exposure to the tech sector, because many of the largest companies listed on the Nasdaq areblue-chiptech behemoths such as Google (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Qualcomm (QCOM).\n\nAll companies in the Invesco QQQ Trust must be listed on the Nasdaq 100 exchange for at least two years. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. Namely, companies that have been listed for only one year\u00a0but have extraordinarily highmarket capitalizationsmay make the cut.\n\nAll stocks need to have anaverage daily trading volumeof 200,000 shares, and they are likewise required to report earnings on both quarterly and annual bases. Companies with bankruptcy issues are omitted from the Invesco QQQ Trust.\n\nThe Invesco QQQ Trust was launched in March 1999. As of June 2024, QQQ had $282 billion total assets under management.\n\nWhile the Invesco QQQ Trust has a technology focus, it includes companies from various sectors and industries. Here are the sectors that it invests in, as of June 2024\n\nIt's worth\u00a0remembering that\u00a0the Invesco QQQ Trust tracks just those stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. That's a limited number of stocks\u00a0compared to other Nasdaq ETFs. Case in point: the popularNasdaq Composite Indextracks every stock listed on the Nasdaq, including financial services names, which amounts to more than 3,000 public companies.\n\nHere are the ETF's top ten holdings, as of April 3, 2023.\n\nDiversification:With a single investment, QQQ investors get exposure to the 100 stocks found in the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nCost:The relatively low .20% expense ratio won't diminish investors' returns as much as higher expense ratios found with other ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nAttractive return potential:The focus on technology and transformative industries offers investors the possibility of higher returns compared to funds with less of a tech focus and greater diversification.\n\nLiquidity:Millions of QQQ shares trade every day, making the ETF efficiently priced, and easy to buy and sell.\n\nNarrow focus:While QQQ is diversified, it owns only 100 stocks and the group is heavily weighted in technology industries.\n\nNasdaq stocks only:Those seeking tech sector exposure miss out on major tech stocks listed elsewhere, e.g., Oracle Corp., Salesforce, Uber Technologies, and SAP, which are on theNYSE.\n\nHigher risk:The higher return potential of the tech sector can subject investors to greatervolatilityandgreater sector risk.\n\nUnderperformance:Like any index fund, QQQ can underperform its target index due to fees and costs. Also, due to its composition, it may perform less well when the market declines than other ETFs/indexes, e.g., SPDR/the S&P 500 Index.\n\nEasy diversification with a single investment\n\nAttractive return potential of tech sector focus\n\nHighly liquid and priced efficiently\n\nDiversified with just 100 stocks\n\nNasdaq-only tech stocks excludes returns of other tech companies\n\nVolatility associated with tech industries\n\nUnderperformance potential from fees and in down markets\n\nQQQ is the stock ticker symbol for the Invesco 100 Trust exchange-traded fund. QQQQ is the ticker used previously and replaced in 2011.\n\nSome of the benefits of QQQ include targeted and convenient diversification, the potential for greater returns compared to those offered by less transformative industries and companies, and the greater liquidity offered by an actively traded security.\n\nYes, it does. In fact, QQQ's target index's growth in dividends measured 433% over the 10 years from Dec. 31, 2011, to Dec. 31, 2021.\n\nQQQQ is the former stock ticker symbol for the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF. It was shortened to QQQ in 2011. While the symbol changed, the ETF did not. It continues to attempt to track the performance of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nETF.com. \"'Q's' ETF Ticker Changes to 'QQQ'.\"\n\nInvesco QQQ. \"Sector Allocations.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"Invesco QQQ Celebrates 20 Years of Curating Innovation.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"Nasdaq\u00ae 100 Companies.\"\n\nInvesco. \"QQQ - Invesco QQQ; Fund Holdings.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"NASDAQ-100 Index\u00ae NDX,\" Page 2.\n\nNasdaq. \"Nasdaq Composite Index.\"\n\nInvesco QQQ. \"Top Ten Holdings.\"\n\nInvesco QQQ. \"How QQQ can fit into your portfolio.\"",
