  "term": "Synthetic Put: What it is and How it Works",
  "definition": "A synthetic put is an options strategy that combines ashortstock position with along call optionon that same stock to mimic along put option. It's also called a synthetic long put. Essentially, an investor who has a short position in a stock purchases anat-the-moneycall option on that same stock. This action is taken to protect against appreciation in the stock's price.\u00a0A synthetic put is also known as a married call or protective call.\n\nThe synthetic put is a strategy that investors can utilize when they have abearishbet on a stock and are concerned about potential\u00a0near-term strength in that stock.\u00a0It is similar to an insurance policy except that the investor wants the price of the underlying stock to fall, not rise. The strategy combines theshort saleof a security with a long-call position on the same security.\n\nA synthetic put mitigates the risk that the underlying price will increase. It does not, however, deal with other dangers, which may leave\u00a0the investor exposed.\u00a0Because it involves a short position in the underlying stock, it carries with it all those associated risks\u2014fees, margin interest, and the possibility of having to paydividendsto the investor from whom the shares were borrowed to sell short.\n\nInstitutional investors can use synthetic puts to disguise their trading bias\u2014be it bullish or bearish\u2014on specific securities. However, for most investors, synthetic puts are best suited for use as an insurance policy. An increase involatilitywould be beneficial to this strategy whiletime decaywould impact it negatively.\n\nThe maximum profit for both a simple short position and a synthetic put is if the stock's value falls to zero. Note that any benefit from a synthetic put must be\u00a0weighted against the options'premium.\n\nA synthetic put strategy helps protect against an increase in the stock's price, effectively putting a cap on the stock price. The cap limitsupsiderisk for the investor (i.e. the risk that the short position's stock price rises).\n\nThe risk of a synthetic put strategy is limited to the difference between the price at which the underlying stock was shorted and the option'sstrike price(as well as any commissions). Put another way, at the time of the purchase of the option, if the price at which the investor shorted the stock was equal to the strike price, the loss for the strategy would be the premiums paid for the option.\n\nRather than a profit-making strategy, a synthetic put is a capital-preserving strategy. With that, the cost of the call portion (the option premium) becomes a built-in cost. Theoption'sprice reduces the profitability of the method\u2014assuming the underlying stock moves in the desired direction, lower.\n\nThus, synthetic puts are often used as insurance policies against short-term spikes in stock prices (in an otherwise bearish stock), or as a protection against an unforeseen move upward in the stock price.\n\nNewer investors may benefit from knowing that their losses in the stock market are limited. This\u00a0safety net can give them confidence as they learn more about different investing strategies. Of course, any protection will come\u00a0at a cost, which includes the price of the option,commissions, and other possible fees.",
