  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn own-occupation insurance policy\u00a0covers individuals who become disabled and are unable to perform the majority of the occupational duties that they have been trained to perform. This type of insurance policy is contingent on the individual being employed at the time thedisabilityoccurs. Own-occupation insurance policies are\u00a0also known as a \"pure own-occupational policy\" and \"own-occupation disability insurance\" in some circles. Doctors will often purchase these policies for protection against injuries.\n\nWhen an own-occupation policy goes into effect, the policyholder\u00a0and the insurance carrier sign a contract\u00a0that says the insurance carrier will pay the policyholder\u00a0a monthly benefit if they become disabled. But what determines a disability?\n\nThe key factor in an own-occupation policy is how \"disabled\" is defined in an insurance contract.\u00a0Because the definition of own-occupation is very flexible, persons covered under an own-occupation policy may find another job and still receive full benefit payments.\n\nUnder the own-occupation disability insurance definition, a policyholder\u00a0will receive benefits if you are unable to work in your \u201cown occupation,\u201d\u00a0regardless of whether you find employment in another profession. This\u00a0language\u00a0will typically look something like this:\u00a0\"You will be considered disabled if you are unable to perform the material and substantial duties of your occupation, even if you are gainfully employed in another occupation.\"\n\nThe definition of own-occupation depends on an important aspect of an insurance policy, namely how the insurance contract defines \"disabled\" as a status.\n\nSometimes, if a person isn't\u00a0working at the time\u00a0they are disabled, they will not be able toclaim insuranceunder a conventional\u00a0own-occupation policy. However,\u00a0if they are covered under a modified own-occupational policy, they will be covered. Under a modified policy, the definition of \"disabled\" includes persons not working at the time of their disablement. These types of insurance policies apply to highly trained individuals, such as surgeons.\n\nConsider Mark,\u00a0a surgeon who loves to do home improvement projects\u00a0when he's not in the operating room. One weekend, Mark\u2019s hand slips on a saw, and his finger has to be amputated. Mark won't be able to do surgery anymore but may be able to work\u00a0in another medical specialty or even a profession outside the medical profession.\n\nUnder the own-occupation\u00a0insurance definition, Mark\u00a0cannot perform the\u00a0substantial duties of his occupation as\u00a0a surgeon. If Mark had\u00a0an own-occupation disability insurance policy, he would\u00a0receive full benefits, regardless of whether he chooses to work in another medical specialty or another profession altogether. This is why\u00a0own-occupation policies\u00a0provide\u00a0the most flexibility for\u00a0policyholders and are critically important for\u00a0doctors to have.",
