  "term": "Gilt-Edged Securities: Definition, History, and Current Uses",
  "definition": "Gilt-edged securities are high-grade bonds issued by certain national governments and private organizations. In the past, these instruments referred to the certificates issued by theBank of England(BOE) on behalf of the Majesty's Treasury, so named because the paper they were printed on customarily featured gilded (golden) edges.\n\nBy nature, a gilt-edged\u00a0denotes a high-quality item whose value remains fairly constant over time. As an investment vehicle, this equates to high-grade securities with relatively low yields compared to riskier, below-investment-grade securities.\n\nFor that reason, gilt-edge securities were once solely issued byblue-chip companiesand national governments with proven track records of turning profits.\u00a0Aside from conventional gilts, the British government issues index-linked gilts that offer semi-annual coupon payments adjusted for inflation.\n\nGovernment bonds in the U.K., India, and several other commonwealth countries are still known asgilts.\n\nGilt-edged securities are high-gradeinvestment bondsoffered by governments and large corporations as a method of borrowing funds. The issuing institutions typically boast strong track records of consistent earnings that can cover dividend or interest payments. In many ways, these are the next safest bonds toU.S. Treasury securities.\n\nThe United Kingdom and other Commonwealth nations still rely on these securities, in much the same way the U.S. uses Treasury bonds to raise revenue. A conventional gilt issued by the U.K. government pays the holder a fixed cash payment biannually until maturity, at which point the principal is returned in full. The coupon payment reflects the market interest rate at the time of issuance and indicates the cash payment that the holder will receive each year.\n\nSimilar to Treasury securities, the duration of gilt-edged assets can range from a few years up to 50 years. After the 2008 recession, large quantities of gilts were created and repurchased by the Bank of England in its campaign to jump-start economic relief efforts.\n\nAbout 20% of all U.K. gilts are held by pension funds.\n\nAlthough gilt-edged securities are offered by reliable government bodies and large corporations, they present certain drawbacks. Primarily, thebondstend to fluctuate with interest rates, where rate hikes will cause the price of a gilt to decline, and vice versa.\n\nDuring periods when global economic conditions are improving, interest rates tend to rise. In this case,gilt ETFs and mutual fundsare likely to fall in value. For this reason, investors looking to generate substantial returns during periods of economic growth may source better value in index funds.\n\nThe greatest advantage of gilt-edge securities is the fact that these instruments are typically tied to interest rates. Consequently, they are ideal investments for retirees seeking reliable returns with minimal risk.\n\nIn business or financial terms, \"gilt-edged\" refers to a financial product of high quality and low risk. Typically, these are securities of the highest value. They are most commonly associated with U.K. government bonds.\n\nU.K. government bonds, known as \"gilts\" are termed as such because the original bond certificates had gilded edges, hence the name of \"gilt-edged\" security.\n\nThe primary advantage of gilt-edged securities is their safety. They are low-risk investments with a better asset quality than equities, and as such, come with low yields, which can be seen as a disadvantage. To earn more yield, one would need to invest in higher-risk securities, such as stocks or high-yield bonds.\n\nGilt-edged securities are high-quality bonds issued by governments or blue-chip companies and are primarily associated with the U.K., as they are government bonds, similar to U.S. Treasuries. Investors looking for safe securities with low yields can consider investing in gilts.\n\nBank of England. \"Working Paper No. 466.
