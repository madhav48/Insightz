  "definition": "Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nA quintile is defined as \u201cequal-sized segments of a population.\u201d It\u2019s one of\u00a0five values that divide a range of data into equal parts. The first quintile represents the lowest fifth of the data (1% to 20%), the second quintile represents the second fifth (21% to 40%), and so on to 100%.\n\nQuintiles are\u00a0used to create cutoff points for a given population;\u00a0a government-sponsored socioeconomic study may use quintiles to determine the maximum wealth a family could possess to belong to the lowest quintile of society. This cutoff point can then be used as a prerequisite for a family to receive a special governmentsubsidyaimed at helping society\u2019s less fortunate.\n\nOne of the most common metrics in statistical analysis, the median, is just the result of dividing a population into two quantiles. A quintile is one of\u00a0five values that divide a range of data into five equal parts, each being one-fifth (20%) of the range. A population split into three equal parts is divided into tertiles, while one split into fourths is divided intoquartiles. The larger the data set, the easier it is to divide into greater quantiles. Economists often use quintiles to analyze very large data sets, such as the population of the United States.\n\nFor example, if we were to look at all of the closing prices for a specific stock for every day in the last year, the top 20% of those prices would represent the upper quintile of the data. The bottom 20% of those prices would represent the lower quintile of the data. There would be three quintiles in between the upper and lower quintiles. While the average of all the stock prices typically falls between the second and fourth quintiles, which is the middle point of the data, outliers on either the high end or the low end of the data may increase or decrease the average value. As a result, it is worth considering the distribution of the data points\u2014and accounting for any significant outliers\u2014when trying to understand the data and the average values.\n\nPoliticians invoke quintiles to illustrate the need for policy changes. For example, a politician who champions economic justice can divide the population into quintiles to illustrate how the top 20% of income earners control what is, in their opinion,\u00a0an unfairly large share of the wealth. On the other end of the spectrum, a politician calling for an end to progressive taxation might use quintiles to make the argument that the top 20% shoulder too large a share of the tax burden.\n\nInThe Bell Curve, a 1994 book on intelligence quotient (IQ), the authors use quintiles throughout the text to illustrate their research, which contends that IQ is heavily correlated with positive outcomes in life. The assertions, however, have been disputed and are considered controversial.\n\nFor certain populations, the use of other methods to examine how the data is distributed makes more sense than using quintiles. For smaller data sets the use of quartiles or tertiles helps prevent the data from being spread too thin. Comparing themean, also known as the \u201caverage,\u201d of a data set to itsmedian, which is the cutoff point where the data is divided into two quantiles, reveals if the data is evenly distributed or skewed toward the top or bottom. A mean that is significantly higher than the median indicates the data is top-heavy, while a lower mean suggests the opposite.\n\nIf you divide a data set into five equal parts, each one is a quintile.\n\nThe fifth quintile is the top data set out of five.\n\nIf you divide a data set into three equal parts, each one is a tertile. It is used for smaller data sets, where dividing into five parts might stretch the data too thin.\n\nA quintile is one-fifth of a data set or 20%. It\u2019s often used to analyze large data sets, such as the population of a country. Politicians might use quintiles to argue for such laws as progressive taxation, using them to show that the upper portion of the population controls too much wealth as opposed to the lower portions. This in turn could lead to advocacy for government subsidies or even the redistribution of wealth through changes in tax policy.\n\nCambridge Dictionary. \"Quintile.\"\n\nBrookings Institute. \"Does 'The Bell Curve' Ring True?
