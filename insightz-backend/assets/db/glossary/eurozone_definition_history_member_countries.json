  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe eurozone, officially known as the euro area, is a geographic and economic region that consists of all the European Union\u00a0countries that have fully incorporated theeuroas their national currency. As of 2022, the eurozone\u00a0consists of 19 countries in theEuropean Union(EU):\u00a0Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.Approximately 340 million people live in the eurozone area.\n\nThe eurozone is one of the largest economic regions in the world and itscurrency, the euro, is considered one of the mostliquidwhen compared to others. This region's currency continues to develop over time and is taking a more prominent position in the reserves of manycentral banks. It is often used as an example when studyingtrilemmas, an economic theory that postulates that nations have three options when making decisions regarding their international monetary policies.\n\nIn 1992, the countries\u00a0making up theEuropean Community (EC)signed\u00a0theMaastricht Treaty, thereby creating the EU. The creation of the EU had a few areas of major impact\u2014it promoted greater coordination and cooperation in policy, broadly speaking, but it had specific effects on citizenship, security and defense policy,\u00a0and economic policy.\n\nRegarding economic policy, the Maastricht Treaty aimed to create a common economic and monetary union, with a central banking system\u2014theEuropean Central Bank(ECB)\u2014and a common currency (the euro).\n\nIn order to do this, the treaty called for the free\u00a0movement of capital between the member states, which then graduated into increased cooperation between\u00a0national central banks and the increased alignment of economic policy among member states. The final step was the introduction of the euro itself, along with the implementation of a singularmonetary policycoming from the ECB.\n\nFor various reasons, not all EU nations are members of the eurozone. Denmark has opted out from joining, although it can do so in the future.Some EU nations havenot yet met the conditions neededto join the eurozone. Other countries choose to use their own currency as a way tomaintain their financial independenceregarding key economic and monetary issues.\n\nSome countries that are not EU nations have adopted the euro as their national currency.The Vatican City, Andorra, Monaco, and San Marino have monetary agreements with the EU allowing them to issue their own euro currency under certain restrictions.\n\nIn order to join the eurozone and use the euro as their currency, EU nations must meet certain criteria consisting of fourmacroeconomicindicators that focus on price stability, sound and sustainable public finances, the durability of convergence, and exchange rate stability.\n\nFor an EU nation to demonstrate price stability, it must demonstrate sustainable price performance and average inflation no more than 1.5 percent above the rate of the three best-performing member states. To demonstrate sound public finances, the government must run abudget deficitno greater than 3% of GDP and hold public debt no greater than 60% of GDP.\n\nA nation's durability of convergence is assessed through its long-term interest rates, which cannot be more than 2 percent above the rate in the three member states with the most stable prices. Lastly, the nation must demonstrate exchange rate stability by participating in theExchange Rate Mechanism(ERM) II for at least two years \"without severe tensions\" and without devaluing against the euro.\n\nEuropean Commission. \"What is the euro area?\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"Euro area.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"Convergence criteria for joining.\"\n\nEurostat. \"Glossary: Excessive Deficit Procedure.\"",
