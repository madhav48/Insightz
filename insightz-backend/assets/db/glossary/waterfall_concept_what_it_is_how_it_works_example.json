  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe waterfall concept is a popularestate planningstrategy in which apermanent life insurancepolicy is transfered\u4e00or rolled over\u4e00from the policyholder to their child or grandchild.\n\nThe purpose of the waterfall concept is to ensure that wealth is passed on from one generation to another in atax-efficientmanner. It does so by structuring a tax-exempt insurance policy, such aswhole lifein a manner that permits its tax-deferred cash value to be withdrawn by the child or grandchild at a future date, after the original policyholder has died.\n\nWhole-life policies have two components. In addition to thedeath benefitthat pays out when the insured passes away, whole-life life insurance policies also accumulate a tax-deferred cash value as the insured pays premiums. Eventually, the insured individual transfers the life insurance policy to a descendant, at which point the funds become taxable on withdrawal.\n\nIn addition to its tax advantages, the waterfall concept can help avoid some of the pitfalls that can apply to gifts and other large-scale transfers of wealth.For example, waterfall concepts can be carried out using only the terms and conditions of the original insurance contract, without requiring the involvement of potential costly lawyers and intermediaries.\n\nTransferring wealth through a waterfall conceptcan help prevent those assets from being allocated to other parties as part of theprobate process.\n\nA typical example of the waterfall concept would be one in which the policy is transferred from a grandparent to a grandchild. The grandchild would then pay taxes only when withdrawing funds from the policy. To the extent that the grandchild\u2019s tax rate is lower than that of their grandparent, this would result in tax savings overall.\n\nWhen using the waterfall concept, it is important to structure the policy in a manner that protects against the risk that the original policyholder might die before the policy is transferred. One method to do so is by designating a third party, such as the child\u2019s parent, as a contingent or irrevocable beneficiary, with the intention that the parent would then transfer the policy to the grandchild once he or she comes of age. This process could be entirely stipulated using the terms of the life insurance contract itself, without requiring the use of atrustor other such legal entity.\n\nThe cash value of a whole life insurance policy is tax-deferred, which means no taxes are owed as long as the money remains in the account. Asavings accountorcertificate of deposit, by contrast, would have earnings that are taxed annually. If beneficiaries pay taxes at a lower rate than the policyholder, withdrawals could be made at that lower tax rate.\n\nWhole life insurance provides a guaranteed death benefit as long as the policy is current, while term life insurance provides a death benefit only if the insured dies within a specified period of time, such as 10 years or 20 years. Because of this difference, term policies typically cost less than whole policies.\n\nCosts can vary depending on several factors, but whole-life policies typically can cost as much as five to 15 times as much as a term policy. And for a term policy,Investopedia researchshows that an average premium is about $30 per month.\n\nThe waterfall concept is a means of transferring wealth from one generation to a subsequent generation by using whole life insurance. In this strategy, the insurance policy is transferred from the policyholder to a child or grandchild. This can reduce probate issues and ultimately reduce taxes since the cash value of the insurance policy is tax-deferred.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \"Life Insurance.\" Accessed March 18, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Estate Tax.\" Accessed March 18, 2021.",
