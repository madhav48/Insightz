  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nErika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nNet settlement is a bank's routine resolution of the day's transactions at the end of the business day.\n\nSince many or most bank transactions are now sent electronically, this is no longer a matter of counting the cash in the drawer. Instead, the bank has to add up all of their electronic credits and debits.\n\nThe bank then sends its settlement file to a Federal Reserve Bank, which credits it with any funds that are due to be paid to it via the interbank settlement system.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe net settlement system permits banks to accumulate credits and debits with each other throughout the business day. Only at the end of the business day are the totals calculated, and only the net differential needs to be transferred between the banks.\n\nNet settlement also finds its place in the trading activity of the stock markets. TheNational Securities Clearing Corporation(NSCC) usescontinuous net settlementat the close of each day to account for security trades made through member entities throughout out the trading day.\n\nA bank's net settlement is similar to balancing an individual\u2019s checkbook. The balancing process gets complicated if you have money coming in as cash, checks, and direct deposits and money going out ascash purchases, checks, and credit card purchases. All of those transactions, including purchases, returns, bills paid, and paychecks received, must be netted to get the full picture.\n\nNet settlement makes it easier for banks to manage theirliquidity. That is, they need to know that they have enough real cash on hand to pay out to their customers over the counter and at the ATMs.\n\nThere are two types of net settlement systems:\n\nIn banking, gross settlement is not the same as net settlement. In particular, areal-time gross settlement systemdiffers from a net settlement .\n\nLarge interbank transfers usually occur in real-time rather than as net settlements.\n\nFor example, the U.K.'s BACS\u00a0Payment Schemes Limited (previously\u00a0the Bankers' Automated Clearing Services\u00a0or BACS) allows transactions among institutions to accumulate during the day. At the close of business, the central bank will adjust the active institutional accounts by the net amounts of the funds exchanged.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nLarge-value interbank funds transfers usually use real-time gross settlement. These often require immediate and complete clearing, which are typically organized by the nation's central bank.\n\nReal-time gross settlement can reduce a bank'ssettlement riskoverall as the interbank settlement occurs in real-time throughout the day, rather than all together at the end of the day as with net settlement. This type of gross settlement eliminates the risk of a lag in completing the transaction.\n\nReal-time gross settlement often incurs a higher charge than net settlement processes.\n\nFederal Reserve Banks. \"National Settlement Service.\" Accessed Nov. 12, 2020.\n\nBacs Payment Schemes Limited. \"An Introduction to the UK's Interbank Payment Schemes,\" Pages 4-5.
