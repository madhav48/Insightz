  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nFast fashion describes low-priced but stylish clothing that moves quickly from design to retail stores to meet and capitalize on trends. Collections are often based on styles presented at Fashion Week runway shows or worn by celebrities. Fast fashion allows mainstream consumers to purchase a new look at an affordable price.\n\nFast fashion resulted from cheaper, speedier manufacturing and shipping methods, the consumer's appetite for up-to-the-minute styles, and increasing purchasing power, especially that of young people. Fast fashion challenges the established clothing labels' tradition of introducing new collections and lines on an orderly, seasonal basis.\n\nShopping for clothingwas once considered an event for which consumers would save over time to buy new clothes periodically. The style-conscious could get a preview of the styles to come by reading fashion magazines and seeing fashion shows that displayed new collections and clothing lines several months before their appearance in stores.\n\nIn the late 1990s, as shopping increasingly became a form of entertainment, discretionary spending on clothing increased. Fast fashion emerged, offering cheap, trendy knock-off garments,mass-produced at low cost. Consumers could wear something similar to what they saw on the runway.\n\nFast fashion was boosted by innovations insupply chain management (SCM)among fashion retailers. The assumption is that consumers want high fashion at a low cost. Fast fashion follows the concept of category management, linking the manufacturer with the consumer in a mutually beneficial relationship.\n\nThe size of the fast fashion market is projected to reach $197 billion by 2028.\n\nMajor players in the fast fashion market include UNIQLO, GAP, Forever 21, Topshop, Esprit, Primark, Fashion Nova, and New Look. Two of the leaders are:\n\nZara:Spanish retail chain Zara, the flagship brand of textile giant Inditex, is synonymous with fast fashion. Due to its short supply chain, Zara's designers can have a finished piece appear on store racks in as little as four weeks. Or can modify existing items in as little as two weeks.\n\nOver half of its factories are located near its corporate headquarters in A Coru\u00f1a, Spain. It produces more than 11,000 pieces annually versus an industry average of 2,000 to 4,000 pieces.\n\nH&M:Founded in 1947, Sweden-based H&M Group (short for Hennes & Mauritz\u00a0) is one of the oldest fast fashion companies. As of 2024, H&M Group operated in 76 countries and had over 4,200 stores.\n\nH&M Group functions like a department store, selling clothing, cosmetics, and home furnishings. It does not own any factories but relies on independent suppliers for its products. H&M production offices oversee suppliers with state-of-the-art IT systems that trackinventoryand communicate with corporate HQ. The factories that it works with are based all over Europe, Asia, and North America.\n\nThe traditional clothing industry model operates seasonally, with Fall Fashion Week and Spring Fashion Week showcasing looks for the four traditional seasons. Fast fashion labels produce about 52 micro-seasons a year\u2014or one new collection of clothes a week meant to be worn immediately.\n\nProfitable for manufacturers and retailers\n\nOffers fast, efficient delivery\n\nDecline in domestic manufacturing\n\nEncourages \"throwaway\" consumer mentality\n\nNegatively impacts the environment\n\nConsumers may find it difficult to avoid products manufactured by companies that practice fast fashion. However, they can investigate fast fashion brands to see if they use sustainable processes and support fair labor practices. They can determine for themselves the impact that fast fashion may have on the environment and people who work in the industry.\n\nShopping for clothes at secondhand stores helps to reduce the amount of garment waste and to extend usage.\n\nAccording to statistics from the\u00a0United Nations Environment Programme\u00a0and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation:\n\nSlow fashion\u2014a concept first introduced in 2008 by fashion and sustainability consultant Kate Fletcher\u2014uses environmentally friendly processes and materials through mindful manufacturing, focusing on quality rather than quantity.Mindful manufacturing, an idea championed by3D printing companyStratasys, is the concept of developing more efficient production, sound chemical and solid waste disposal practices, reusable materials, and recycled packaging.\n\nSome examples of companies in fast fashion are Stradivarius,Victoria's Secret, Urban Outfitters, and Zara.\n\nConsumers who enjoy the latest fashion with the advantage of low prices benefit, but the primary beneficiaries are investors, owners, and other stakeholders who profit from the practice.\n\nFast fashion increases consumer spending and profits. It satisfies the consumer's need to participate in a fashion trend.\u00a0However, critics say the industry contributes to\u00a0climate change,\u00a0pesticide pollution, and\u00a0waste. The debate around fast fashion and its alternatives will continue as long as consumers seek to buy the latest styles at low prices and rapid replenishment rates.\n\nResearch and Markets. \"Fast Fashion Global Market Report 2021-30: COVID-19 Growth and Change to 2030.\"\n\nSCM Globe. \"Zara Clothing Company Supply Chain.\"\n\nThe Good Trade. \"What Is Fast Fashion, Anyway?\"\n\nThe New York Times. \"What Do Gen Z Shoppers Want?
