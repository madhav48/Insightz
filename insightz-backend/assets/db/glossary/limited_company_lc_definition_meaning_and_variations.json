  "definition": "A limited company (LC) is a type of business structure that keeps the personal finances and property of its owners legally distinct from the company's own finances and liabilities.\n\nA limited company (LC) is a general form of incorporation that limits the amount ofliabilityundertaken by the company's shareholders. It\u00a0refers to a legal structure that ensures that the liability of company members or subscribers is limited to their stake in thecompanyby way of investments or commitments. In a legal sense, a limited company is a person.\n\nThe naming convention for this type of corporate structure is commonly used in the United Kingdom, where a firm's name is followed by the abbreviated \"Ltd.\" In the United States, limited companies come in several forms, including the limited liability corporation (LLC).\n\nAs noted, in a limited company, the assets and debts of the company are separate from those of the shareholders. As a result, should the company experiencefinancial distressbecause of normal business activity, the personal assets ofshareholderswill not be at risk of being seized by creditors.\n\nOwnership in the limited company can be easily transferred, and many of these companies have been passed down through generations. Unlike a public company, in which anyone can buy shares, membership in a limited company is governed\u00a0by a company's rules and law.\n\nA limited company can be \"limited by shares\" or \"limited by guarantee.\" When limited by shares, a company is owned by one or more shareholders and managed by at least one director. In a limited by guarantee arrangement, a company is owned by one or more guarantors and managed by at least one director.\n\nThe primary benefit of a limited company is the separation of assets and income from the corporation and the owners and investors throughlimited liability. This means that if a company goes bust, shareholders can only lose as much as their original investment and no more;creditorsor otherstakeholderscannot claim the owners' personal assets or income. Because of limited liability, investors are more eager to risk capital since their losses are limited in that sense.\n\nFiling as a limited company comes with a number of benefits. They include:\n\nFor the privilege, limited companies in the U.K. must pay a variety of taxes, such asvalue-added tax (VAT)and capital gains tax, and must contribute to National Insurance. Limited companies in the U.K. receive favorable tax treatment once their income reaches a certain threshold. The corporate tax rate is a flat rate of 19%.\n\nBy comparison, unincorporated businesses, such assole proprietorshipsand traditionalpartnerships, do not afford full limits on liability for owners because there is no legal distinction between the business and its owners. If such a business were to become insolvent, its owners would be responsible for its debts.\n\nLimited company structures are codified in many nations, though the regulations governing them can differ widely from one nation to the next. For example, in the United Kingdom, there are private limited companies and public limited companies.\n\nPrivate limited companies are not permitted to offer shares to the public. They are, however, the most popular structures for a small business. Public limited companies (PLCs) may offer shares to the public to raise capital. Those shares may trade on a stock exchange once a total share value threshold is met (at least GBP 50,000).Such a structure is widely employed by larger companies.\n\nIn the United States, a limited company is more commonly known as a corporation (Corp.)\u00a0or as incorporated (Inc.).\u00a0Some states permit the use ofLtd.\u00a0(limited)after a company name. Such a designation depends on filing the correct paperwork; just adding the suffix to a company name does not provide any liability protection. Limited companies in the U.S. are required to file corporate taxes annually with regulators.Limited liability companies (LLCs)and limited companies have different structures.\n\nMany countries differentiate between public and private limited companies. For example, in Germany, theAktiengesellschaft(AG) designation is for public limited companies that can sell shares to the public, whileGmbHis for private limited companies that cannot issue shares.\n\nGov.uk. \"Guidance: Rates and allowances for Corporation Tax.\"\n\nThomson Reuters Practical Law. \"Glossary: Public limited company (PLC).\"",
