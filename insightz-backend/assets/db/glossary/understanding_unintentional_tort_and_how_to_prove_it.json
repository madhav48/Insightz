  "term": "Understanding Unintentional Tort and How to Prove It",
  "definition": "An unintentional tort is a type of unintended accident that leads to injury, property damage, or financial loss. In the event of an unintentionaltort, the person who caused the accident did so inadvertently and typically because they were not being careful.\n\nThe person who caused the accident is considered negligent because they failed to exercise the same degree of care that a reasonable person would have in the same situation.\n\nThe most common type\u00a0of unintentional tort isnegligence. Someone is\u00a0negligent if they\u00a0unintentionally cause injury to someone in a situation where a \"reasonable\" person would have been aware of their actions enough to not cause harm.\u00a0To prove a defendant was negligent, a\u00a0plaintiff must prove three factors.\n\nTo prove unintentional negligence in a court of law, a\u00a0plaintiff must first prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff\u00a0a \"duty of care\" or anobligation to avoid careless actions that could cause harm to one or more persons. Second, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant failed to provide the\u00a0standard of care\u00a0of a reasonable person. Standard of care is a gauge of\u00a0how much care one person owes another, and it's higher for some people than others.\u00a0Doctors, for example, owe\u00a0a higher standard of care toward others than a regular\u00a0person.\n\nLast, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions caused their\u00a0injuries. Determining the cause, known as\u00a0cause-in-fact,\u00a0is often done by applying the \u201cbut for\u201d test, as in an injury would not have happened \u201cbut for\u201d the defendant\u2019s actions.\n\nChildren can be held responsible for the damage they cause, but\u00a0the courts place a different standard of care on a child. Courts will consider the child\u2019s age, life experience, and what a child of a similar age would have done under similar circumstances. Children under age 6\u00a0are rarely foundliablefor their actions.\n\nParents\u00a0can be held liable if they fail to train their children or properly supervise their activities, but they are not automatically held liable for a child's actions. However, a\u00a0child can sue a parent if they were\u00a0injured because of a parent\u2019s negligence.\n\nTo illustrate this concept, consider\u00a0a camp counselor that\u00a0takes a group of campers\u00a0on a river rafting\u00a0trip but\u00a0fails to provide life jackets. If a\u00a0camper\u00a0falls in and drowns, a court might contend\u00a0that the camper\u00a0would not have drowned \u201cbut for\u201d the camp\u00a0counselor\u2019s failure to provide a life jacket. In this example, the camp counselor's\u00a0negligence was the cause-in-fact of the injury.",
