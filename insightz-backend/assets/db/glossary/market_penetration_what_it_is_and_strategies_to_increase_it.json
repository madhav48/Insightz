  "term": "Market Penetration: What It Is and Strategies to Increase It",
  "definition": "Market penetration measures how many customers buy or use a product or service out of the total market.\n\nMarket penetration is a measure of how much a product or service is being used by consumers compared to its total estimatedtarget market. Put simply, it refers to how well a product or service sells in the market. Generally expressed as a percentage, market penetration can be used to develop strategies employed to increase the market share of a particular product or service. Focusing on marketing penetration can increase sales but also runs the risk of backfiring if strategies aren't properly executed.\n\nMarket penetration can determine the size of the potential market for a product or service. New entrants to the industry believe they can gainmarket shareor a percentage of the total number of potential customers in the industry in a large market.\n\nFor example, if there are 300 million people in a country and 65 million of them own cell phones, the market penetration of cell phones would be approximately 22%. In theory, there are 235 million customers (78% of the population) without cell phones. The penetration numbers might indicate the potential for growth for cell phone makers.\n\nMarket penetration can assess an industry to determine the potential for companies to gain market share or grow their revenue through sales. For instance, the global cell phone market penetration is often used to estimate whether cell phone producers can meet their earnings and revenue estimates. If the market is saturated, the existing companies have the vast majority of the market share\u2014leaving little room for newsales growth.\n\nA key component of market penetration is quantifying a company's market penetration. You can do this by calculating a firm's market penetration rate (discussed below). The rate is a ratio that compares a company's performance against the total market. This rate allows companies to compare where they are currently, where they have been, where they want to be, and how their competitors are performing.\n\nThe market penetration rate allows a company to set a SMART goal that can be calculated and tracked over time.\n\nMarket penetration describes what proportion of the market is saturated by a company. To calculate market penetration, you must know the number of customers a company secures in addition to the total market size.\n\nMarket\u00a0Penetration\u00a0Rate=Customers\u00a0NumberTTMS\u00d7100where:TTMS=Total\u00a0Target\u00a0Market\u00a0Size\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Market Penetration Rate} = \\frac {\\text{Customers Number} }{ \\text{TTMS} } \\times 100 \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&\\text{TTMS} = \\text{Total Target Market Size} \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bMarket\u00a0Penetration\u00a0Rate=TTMSCustomers\u00a0Number\u200b\u00d7100where:TTMS=Total\u00a0Target\u00a0Market\u00a0Size\u200b\n\nThe number of customers is a unique customer that the company secures. Some may choose to only userepeat customersto analyze the stronger consumer base. Others may choose any customer that transacts in a given period (e.g. over the past five years).\n\nThe total market size may be difficult to define, especially if the company has a broad geographical area or sells goods online. The total market size is not necessarily the population of the area. Rather, it is the total potential customers the company could have.\n\nAn alternative but similar way to calculate market penetration is to focus on dollars as opposed to people. Sometimes, industries may be quoted as having a certain value or sales potential, which means companies can compare what they've sold and compare it to this market potential.\n\nMarket\u00a0Penetration\u00a0Rate=Total\u00a0Sales\u00a0DollarsTTMSP\u00d7100where:TTMSP=Total\u00a0Target\u00a0Market\u00a0Sales\u00a0Potential\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Market Penetration Rate} = \\frac {\\text{Total Sales Dollars} }{ \\text{TTMSP} } \\times 100 \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&\\text{TTMSP} = \\text{Total Target Market Sales Potential} \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bMarket\u00a0Penetration\u00a0Rate=TTMSPTotal\u00a0Sales\u00a0Dollars\u200b\u00d7100where:TTMSP=Total\u00a0Target\u00a0Market\u00a0Sales\u00a0Potential\u200b\n\nIn the latter formula, a company may care less about the number of customers it secures. This may be important for companies that want to secure the largest customers or biggest market participants. Though they may receive a small penetration rate, companies that transact with the largest customers may be in better shape when using the second formula.\n\nMarket penetration can also be used by companies to assess their product's market share. As a metric, it relates to the number of potential customers who purchased a specific company\u2019s product instead of a competitor\u2019s product\u2014or no product at all.\n\nMarket penetration is typically expressed as a percentage, meaning the company's product represents a certain percentage of the total market for those products. To calculate market penetration, the current sales volume for the product or service is divided by the totalsales volumeof all similar products, including those sold by competitors. The result is multiplied by 100.\n\nMarket penetration is often cited as a percentage representing the total share of target customers attracted.\n\nIf a company has a high market penetration for its products, they're considered a market leader in that industry. Market leaders have a marketing advantage because they can reach more potential customers due to theirwell-established products and brands.\n\nFor example, a market leader and manufacturer of cereal will have far more shelf space and better positioning than competitorbrandsbecause their products are so popular.\n\nMarket leaders can also negotiate better terms with their suppliers because of their significant sales volume. As a result, market leaders can often produce a product cheaper than their competitors, given the scale of their operation.\n\nThere are often four ways of implementing growth strategies: developing new markets, diversifying product lines, penetrating existing markets, or developing new products. These four strategies are often depicted in an Ansoff Matrix.\n\nBecause the strategies that require new markets or products are considered riskier, market penetration is often the lower-risk option for growth. This is because the market has already been created and can be studied. The company may already offer a product or a variation. Using some of the techniques below, a company may experience growth through market penetration.\n\nA company won't be able to increase market share by increasing its price. However,Veblen goodscontradict the law of supply and demand, and a company can increase market penetration by increasing its prices for such goods. For other goods, it would need to lower prices.\n\nThis requires the company to sufficiently understand its input costs andprofit margins. It also requires an understanding of its consumer base and whether a lower price will attract the audience the company intends to have for the long term.\n\nThough market penetration often occurs with existing products, a company may be able to solve a customer's problem with a new product innovation.\n\nThough this riskier option does not guarantee market adoption, a company may invest inresearch and development (R&D) to study existing products, analyze gaps in value, detect where existing products fall short of consumer expectations, and manufacture a new product.\n\nBusinesses may already have access to wider markets thanks to online sales. But, service companies that may be restricted to one geographic region may employ the market penetration strategy of moving,developing, and expanding to a new area.\n\nWithout having to leave their original location, they may be able to fund operations in a new site by leveraging success at an existing site.\n\nInstead of seeking new places to operate, companies may penetrate new markets by seeking new people to work with. Consider the Barnes & Noble and Starbucks partnership. By agreeing to share in the success of internally operated cafes within bookstores, Starbucks entered a different market it otherwise couldn't have accessed.\n\nIn the example above, it would have been critical for Starbucks to consider how its brand image integrated with Barnes & Noble. Without careful consideration, customers may have been confused to see it within other types of stores (i.e. consider a Starbucks inside of a Home Depot).\n\nCompanies may simply need to revamp an existing product. This is evident with the frequent releases of updated smartwatches, cellphones, gaming consoles, and other technological devices.\n\nWith each iteration, a company can simply improve on the previous one and offer new benefits. Existing customers who experience the old devices may be further inclined to upgrade after a positive experience.\n\nThough partnerships entail two separate entities temporarily coming together to share in the success, acquisitions result in two separate entities legally joining together. Byacquiringa company, the acquirer may instantly have access to new products, markets, labor skill sets, intangible assets like goodwill, or research & development.\n\nCompanies that do not want to permanently discount their prices can penetrate markets by offering temporary promotional opportunities. This strategy lures consumers in by attracting them to low prices.\n\nBe advised that though this may result in short-term success, it is more likely to lead to the incorrect audience having been attracted, especially if a company strives to be a higher-quality (and therefore higher price) company.\n\nCompanies may have everything they need to successfully bring a product to market. But, their product may fail if they don't have enough staff. No matter how strong a manufactured product is, a company must be able to bring it to market, communicate its value, and close sales. This may require an increase in the headcount of sales reps or investing in stronger talent.\n\nMay attract the wrong customers\n\nRequires alignment of all departments\n\nAs of the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple (AAPL) had a 23% market share of the smartphone market, second to Samsung, which has a 16% market share.\n\nApple consistently introduces new versions of its iPhone every year, with added enhancements and upgrades, making the phone a compelling product to buy for consumers. As a result of its market penetration, Apple has maintained a large market share when compared to some other competitors, such as Xiaomi and Vivo.\n\nHowever, the company still has opportunities to add to its customer base by targeting its competitors' clients, primarily Samsung, to woo them over to the iPhone and grab further market share.\n\nMarket penetration strategies are used to ultimately increase the number of customers and sales dollars of a company. Market penetration is the act of gaining a deeper presence in a market; by employing strategies to increase how deep a company is engrained in a market, that company often has greater short-term and long-term financial health, is better in tune with what its customers want, and is often better positioned compared to its competition.\n\nThough both terms are used interchangeably, market penetration and market share are different. Market penetration is often used to describe just the percentage of target audience a company sells to, while market share takes a more holistic approach and looks at the percentage of the total addressable market a company sells to.\n\nBecause market penetration is a more specific measurement of how much of a given market a company sells to, increasing market penetration often increases market share potential. For example, consider Apple moving into the smartwatch industry. Not only does this increase its market penetration potential, but it is now part of an entirely new market and could potentially land parts of this new market share.\n\nMarket penetration is a measurement of how much of a product is used compared to a company's target audience. There are many strategies a company can use to increase its market penetration including changing its pricing, marketing, manufacturing, or operating strategies. A company must be mindful to stay true to its target audience and broadly communicate penetration strategies across the company.\n\nCounterpoint. \"Global Smartphone Shipment Market Data (Q2 2023 - Q4 2024).\"",
