  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nFinancial exposure is the amount an investor stands to lose\u00a0in an\u00a0investment should the investment fail. For example, the financial exposure involved in purchasing a car would be the initial investment amount\u00a0minus the insured portion. Knowing and understanding financial exposure, which is an alternative name forrisk, is a crucial part of the investment process.\n\nInvestors are always seeking to limit their financial exposure while trying to maximize profits, which\u00a0helps to maintain a balance of risk and reward.\n\nFor instance, if 100 shares of stock purchased at $10 a share appreciated to $20, selling 50 shares would eliminate the financial exposure. The original purchase cost the investor $1,000. As the shares appreciate, selling 50 shares at $20 returns the investor's initial stake.\n\nThis method is what is meant by \"taking money off the table.\" It is also sometimes colloquially referred to as \"playing with the house's money.\"\n\nThe only risk going forward would be for the profit made as the investor has already recouped the principal amount. Conversely, if the stock decreased from the original purchase price of $10 to $5 per share, the investor would have lost half the original principal amount.\n\nFinancial exposure applies not only to investing in the stock market but exists whenever an individual stands to lose any of the principal value spent. Purchasing a home is an excellent example of financial exposure. If the value of real estate declines and the homeowner sells at a lower price\u00a0than the original purchase price, the homeowner recognizes a loss on the investment.\n\nThe simplest way to minimize financial exposure is to put money into principal-protected investments with little to no risk. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or savings accounts are two ways to\u00a0reduce financial exposure drastically.Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) guarantees both the investment in CDs and the savings account up to the qualified coverage amounts of $250,000.\n\nHowever, with no risk, an investment provides little return. Also, if there is little financial exposure, this\u00a0leaves a conservative investor vulnerable\u00a0to other risks\u00a0such as inflation.\n\nAnother way to reduce financial exposure is todiversifyamong many investments and asset classes. To build a less volatile portfolio, an investor should have a combination of stocks, bonds, real estate, and other various asset classes.\n\nWithin equities, there should be further diversification among sectors,market capitalizations, and exposure to\u00a0domestic and international markets. When an investor diversifies their portfolio successfully among many asset classes, it should reduce overall volatility. If the market turns bearish, non-correlating asset classes willminimize the downside.\n\nHedgingis another way to reduce financial exposure. There are many ways to hedge a portfolio or an investment. Airlines purchase crude oil futures contracts at current prices in anticipation of future passenger load as a hedge.\n\nLater, if oil prices skyrocket and cause the airline industry to raise ticket prices and shrink margins, those hedged Airlines\u00a0may be able to maintain lower ticket prices and grab market share from the competition.\n\nAn investor can hedge in the stock market by using options, inverse exchange-traded funds,\u00a0or bear-oriented funds. Gold is one of the most common hedges, and it typically appreciates\u00a0with an inflating dollar or volatile markets.\n\nFinancial exposure is the potential loss of the total amount invested. For example, if an individual invests $2,000 into a stock, their financial exposure is $2,000, and if the stock drops, they could lose the entire $2,000 value.\n\nOne of the best ways to limit your financial exposure is to diversify your portfolio. Rather than having your investments concentrated in one stock, invest in multiple stocks; rather than having your investments in one sector, invest in multiple sectors, and rather than having your investments be in only one type of security, invest in multiple securities, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and art.\n\nHedging is a strategy used to reduce financial exposure by taking the opposite position in a security one has invested in. For example, if you expect the price of oil to rise, you will purchase oil futures (go long); however, just in case oil prices fall, you hedge your financial exposure by selling oil futures (go short). So if oil prices do fall and you were wrong, you will lose money on your long oil futures but make money on your short oil futures, reducing the money you lost.\n\nInvestors must consistently manage risk and reward. The higher the risk, generally the upside potential is greater, but so are the chances for losses. Understanding one's financial exposure when picking investments is critical to success. Investors can take actions to mitigate financial exposure, such as through diversification and hedging, ensuring that their losses are minimal.\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Are My Deposit Accounts Insured by the FDIC?\"",
