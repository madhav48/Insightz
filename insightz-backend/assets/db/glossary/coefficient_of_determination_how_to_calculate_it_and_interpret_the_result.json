Investors use this measure to understand what percentage of a stock\u2019s price movement can be explained by broader movements of that index.\n\nThe coefficient of determination is a measurement that's used to explain how much the variability of one factor is caused by its relationship to another factor. This correlation is represented as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 or 0% and 100%.\n\nA value of 1.0 indicates a 100% price correlation and is a reliable model for future forecasts. A value of 0.0 suggests that the model shows that prices aren't a function of dependency on the index.\n\nA value of 0.20 suggests that 20% of an asset's price movement can be explained by the index. A value of 0.50 indicates that 50% of its price movement can be explained by it.\n\nThe coefficient of determination is the square of the correlation coefficient, also known as \"r\" in statistics. The value \"r\" can result in anegative number, but r2can't result in a negative number because r-squared is the result of \"r\" multiplied by itself or squared. The square of a negative number is always a positive value.\n\nCalculating the coefficient of determination is achieved by creating a scatter plot of the data and a trend line.\n\nFor example, you could collect the prices as shown in this table to plot the closing prices for the S&P 500 and Apple (AAPL) stock for trading days from Dec. 21, 2022, to Jan. 20, 2023 (Apple is listed on the S&P 500).\n\nYou'd then create a scatter plot. How well the data fits the regression model on a graph is referred to as thegoodness of fit. It measures the distance between a trend line and all the data points that are scattered throughout the diagram.\n\nMost spreadsheets use the same formula tocalculate the r2of a dataset. If the data reside in columns A and B on your sheet:\n\nYou get an r2 of 0.347 using this formula and highlighting the corresponding cells for the S&P 500 and Apple prices, suggesting that the two prices are less correlated than if the r2was between 0.5 and 1.0.\n\nCalculating the coefficient of determination manually involves several steps. First, gather the data as in the previous table, then calculate all the values you need as shown in this table:\n\nUse this formula and substitute the values for each row of the table wherenequals the number of samples taken. That's 20 in this case:\n\nr2=(n(\u2211xy)\u2212(\u2211x)(\u2211y)[n\u2211x2\u2212(\u2211x)2]\u00d7[n\u2211y2\u2212(\u2211y)2])2\\begin{aligned}&r ^ 2 = \\Big ( \\frac {n ( \\sum xy) - ( \\sum x )( \\sum y ) }{ \\sqrt { [ n \\sum x ^ 2 - ( \\sum x ) ^ 2 ] } \\times \\sqrt { [ n \\sum y ^ 2 - ( \\sum y ) ^ 2 ] } } \\Big ) ^ 2 \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200br2=([n\u2211x2\u2212(\u2211x)2]\u200b\u00d7[n\u2211y2\u2212(\u2211y)2]\u200bn(\u2211xy)\u2212(\u2211x)(\u2211y)\u200b)2\u200b\n\nWhere \u221a represents the square root of the product in the brackets that follow it.\n\nr2=(20(10,262,772.73)\u2212(77,781.69)(2,638.05)[20(302,584,424)\u2212(77,781.69)2]\u00d7[20(348,307.23)\u2212(2,638.05)2])2\\begin{aligned}&r ^ 2 = \\Big ( \\tiny { \\frac {20 ( 10,262,772.73) - ( 77,781.69 )( 2,638.05 ) }{ \\sqrt { [ 20 ( 302,584,424 ) - ( 77,781.69 ) ^ 2 ] } \\times \\sqrt { [ 20 ( 348,307.23 ) - ( 2,638.05 ) ^ 2 ] } } } \\Big ) ^ 2 \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200br2=([20(302,584,424)\u2212(77,781.69)2]\u200b\u00d7[20(348,307.23)\u2212(2,638.05)2]\u200b20(10,262,772.73)\u2212(77,781.69)(2,638.05)\u200b)2\u200b\n\n1.(20\u00d710,262,772.73)\u2212(77,781.69\u00d72,638.05)=63,467.322.((20\u00d7302,584,424)\u2212(77,781.69)2=1,697,180.74=1,302.763.((20\u00d710,262,772.73)\u2212(2,638.05)2=6,836.85=82.69\\begin{aligned}&1. \\tiny { ( 20 \\times 10,262,772.73 ) - ( 77,781.69 \\times 2,638.05 ) = 63,467.32 } \\\\&2. \\tiny { (\\sqrt { ( 20 \\times 302,584,424 ) - ( 77,781.69 ) ^ 2 } = \\sqrt { 1,697,180.74 } = 1,302.76 } \\\\&3. \\tiny { (\\sqrt { ( 20 \\times 10,262,772.73 ) - ( 2,638.05 ) ^ 2 } = \\sqrt { 6,836.85 } = 82.69 }\\\\\\end{aligned}\u200b1.(20\u00d710,262,772.73)\u2212(77,781.69\u00d72,638.05)=63,467.322.((20\u00d7302,584,424)\u2212(77,781.69)2\u200b=1,697,180.74\u200b=1,302.763.((20\u00d710,262,772.73)\u2212(2,638.05)2\u200b=6,836.85\u200b=82.69\u200b\n\nNow multiply steps two and three, divide step one by the result, and square it:\n\n(63,467.321,302.76\u00d782.69)2=0.347\\begin{aligned}&\\Big ( \\frac { 63,467.32 }{ 1,302.76 \\times 82.69 } \\Big ) ^ 2 = 0.347\\end{aligned}\u200b(1,302.76\u00d782.6963,467.32\u200b)2=0.347\u200b\n\nYou can see how this can become very tedious with lots of room for error, particularly if you're using more than a few weeks of trading data.\n\nOnce you have the coefficient of determination, you use it to evaluate how closely the price movements of the asset you're evaluating correspond to the price movements of an index or benchmark. The coefficient of determination for the period was 0.347 in the Apple andS&P 500example.\n\nApple is listed on many indexes, so you can calculate the r2to determine if it corresponds to any other index's price movements.\n\nA coefficient of determination of 0.347 indicates that Apple stock price movements are somewhat correlated with the index, as 1.0 represents a high correlation and 0.0 indicates no correlation.\n\nOne aspect to consider is that r-squared doesn't tell analysts whether the coefficient of determination value is intrinsically good or bad. It's at their discretion to evaluate the meaning of this correlation and how it may be applied in future trend analyses.\n\nThe coefficient of determination shows the level of correlation between one dependent and one independent variable. It's also called r2or r-squared. The value should be between 0.0 and 1.0. The closer it is to 0.0, the lesscorrelatedthe dependent value is. The closer to 1.0, the more correlated the value.\n\nR-squared in regression tells you whether there's a dependency between two values and how much dependency one value has on the other.\n\nThe coefficient of determination can't be more than one because the formula always results in a number between 0.0 and 1.0. Something is incorrect if it's greater or less than these numbers.\n\nThe coefficient of determination is a ratio that shows how dependent one variable is on another. Investors use it to determine howcorrelated an asset's price movementsare with its listed index.\n\nIt doesn't demonstrate dependency on the index when an asset's r2is closer to zero. It's more dependent on the price moves the index makes if its r2is closer to 1.0.\n\nPennsylvania State University Eberly College of Science. \"STAT 462 Applied Regression Analysis: 2.5 - The Coefficient of Determination, R-Squared.\"\n\nLibreTexts Statistics. \"10.6: The Coefficient of Determination.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"APPL Historical Data.\"",
