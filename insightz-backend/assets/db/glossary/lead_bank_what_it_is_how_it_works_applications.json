She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA lead bank is a bank that oversees the arrangement ofloan syndication. The lead bank receives an additional fee for this service, which involves recruiting the syndicate members and negotiating the financing terms. In theEurobondmarket, the lead bank acts in an agent capacity for an underwriting syndicate.\n\nA lead bank is also known as alead underwriter.\n\nA lead bank usually refers to aninvestment bankthat manages the process of underwriting a security in conjunction with other banks, known as syndicate banks. In this sense, the lead bank can also be referred to as a lead manager or managingunderwriter. A more general meaning of this term is simply the primary bank of an organization that uses several banks for several different purposes.\n\nThe lead\u00a0underwriting bank\u00a0will usually work with other investment banks to establish anunderwriter\u00a0syndicate, and thereby create the initial sales force for a company's securities. These bonds or shares will then be sold to institutional and retail clients.\u00a0The lead bank will usually be the one to assess the company financials and current market conditions to arrive at the initial value and quantity of shares to be sold. These securities often carry a hefty sales commission (as much as 6 to\u00a08 percent) for the syndicate, with the majority of shares being held by the lead bank.\n\nIn loan syndication, multiple banks will work together to provide a borrower with the capital needed. Loan syndications generally form for corporate borrowing purposes, including formergers,acquisitions,buyouts, and other capital projects. Situations that require loan syndication will usually involve a borrower who needs a large sum of capital that may be too much for a single lender to provide and/or outside the scope of this lender's risk exposure levels.\n\nA lead bank, in this case, is often responsible for all aspects of the deal, including the initial transaction, fees, compliance reports, repayments throughout the duration of the loan, loan monitoring and overall reporting for all lenders within the deal. Lead banks of loan syndications may charge high fees because of the vast reporting and coordination efforts needed to complete and maintain loan processing. These fees can be as high as 10% of the loan principal.\n\nAt times the lead bank may rely on a third party and/or additional specialists throughout various points of the loan syndication or repayment process to assist with reporting and monitoring.\n\nIn aninitial public offering (IPO)or other forms of issuing securities, a lead bank may organize a group of underwriters, also called the underwriting syndicate, for the deal. As with a loan syndicate, the purpose of an underwriting syndicate is often to spread outriskand/or merge funds in a large deal.\n\nLead banks will assess an issuing company\u2019s financials and current market conditions to arrive at an initial value and quantity of shares to be sold. Newly issued shares may carry a hefty sales commission for an underwriting syndicate (at times, nearly 6%\u20138%); however, the largest portion of shares will go to the lead bank.",
