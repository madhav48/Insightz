  "definition": "Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia\n\nNet profit margin is a metric that includes all factors of a company\u2019s operation and predicts profits based on current revenue.\n\nNet profit margin (otherwise known as net margin) is a measure of how much profit (ornet income) a business generates. Most often, the net profit margin is shown as a percentage but it may also be represented by a decimal.\n\nThe net profit margin shows how much of each dollar a business earns actually translates into profit. It\u2019s calculated by dividing a company\u2019s net income by its total revenue and multiplying that figure by 100.\n\nWe\u2019ll take a deeper dive into the net profit margin formula, including both hypothetical and real examples later in this article.\n\nTake a look at a company\u2019s net profit margin as a first assessment of its overall value.\n\nNet profit margin is one of the most comprehensive profitability metrics, as it includes all factors of a company\u2019s operation. Carefully tracking fluctuations in net profit margin allows businesses to determine whether their current strategy is effective and accurately predictprofitsbased on current revenue.\n\nSince net profit margin is typically expressed as a percentage, it\u2019s simple to compare the profitability of two or more companies even if they vary in size and scope.\n\nNet profit margin includes all the below factors in a business's operations:\n\nA business\u2019s net profit margin is an important metric for investors to determine the profitability of a company and whether or not the business is a good investment. Generally, if a business has a growing revenue, but its operating expenses are increasing, its net profit margin will decrease. Maintaining a strong record of increasing profit margins coupled with shrinking expenses may make a business more attractive to prospectiveinvestors.\n\nA company can regularly review costs and pricing strategies to optimize revenue and increase its net profit margin.\n\nTo calculate net profit margin, use the following formula:\n\nNet\u00a0profit\u00a0margin=R\u2212COGS\u2212E\u2212I\u2212TR\u2217100=Net\u00a0incomeR\u2217100where:R=RevenueCOGS=The\u00a0cost\u00a0of\u00a0goods\u00a0soldE=Operating\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0expensesI=InterestT=Taxes\\begin{aligned} \\text{Net profit margin} &= \\frac{R - COGS - E - I - T}{R}*100\\\\ &= \\frac{\\text{Net income}}{R}*100\\\\ \\textbf{where:}\\\\ R &= \\text{Revenue}\\\\ COGS &= \\text{The cost of goods sold}\\\\ E &= \\text{Operating and other expenses}\\\\ I &= \\text{Interest}\\\\ T &= \\text{Taxes} \\end{aligned}Net\u00a0profit\u00a0marginwhere:RCOGSEIT\u200b=RR\u2212COGS\u2212E\u2212I\u2212T\u200b\u2217100=RNet\u00a0income\u200b\u2217100=Revenue=The\u00a0cost\u00a0of\u00a0goods\u00a0sold=Operating\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0expenses=Interest=Taxes\u200b\n\nHere\u2019s a hypothetical example of net profit margin for Company X:\n\nIn this case, Company X\u2019s net profit margin is 44.6% ($67,000 \u00f7 $150,000 x 100). A 44.6% profit margin indicates that a business earns around 44 to 45 cents in profit for every dollar it collects.\n\nHere\u2019s a real-world example of net profit margin:\n\nPictured above is the financial statement for Microsoft Corporation for the three months ending Sept. 30, 2024 (left column labeled 2024):\n\nGross profit marginis how much money is left over from total revenue after subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS measures the direct costs associated with the production of goods and services. It may include elements such as labor costs and material costs, and it is deducted from the total revenue to calculate profit.\n\nHowever, it doesn\u2019t include a company\u2019soverheadcosts, including employee salaries or advertising expenses, for example. It often appears as a second line item on a company\u2019s income statement, after the sales revenue.\n\nGross profit margin is calculated by subtracting net sales from the COGS (which equals the gross margin) and dividing that figure by the net sales.\n\nHere\u2019s how to calculate the gross profit margin:\n\nIt\u2019s represented as a percentage of net income remaining as profit after accounting for the COGS. Unlike net profit margin, gross profit margin helps determine how much profit is generated from a business\u2019s goods and services since it does not include overhead costs whereas net profit margin does.\n\nNet profit margin includes all expenses like employee salaries, debt payments, andtaxeswhereas gross profit margin identifies how much revenue is directly generated from a business\u2019s goods and services but excludes overhead costs. Net profit margin may be considered a more holistic overview of a company\u2019s profitability.\n\nInvestors should consider a company\u2019s net profit margin because it\u2019s a key indicator of a company\u2019sprofitabilityand whether investing in it is a wise decision. If a business shows increasing profits and decreased expenses over time, this may make it more worthwhile and profitable to potential investors.\n\nA company can positively impact its net profit margin by increasing its revenue, whether through price increases or an increased sale volume, while simultaneously eliminating unnecessary expenses and increasing efficiencies.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to recognize that cutting expenses may negatively impact profits if the cuts are too dramatic. For example, if a companylays offhalf its staff to save on salary costs, it may be more difficult to drive company profits with fewer workers. Alternatively, if a company finds cheaper supplies for its materials, perhaps that may result in producing a lower quality product which, in turn, could decrease sales.\n\nThe net profit margin indicates a business\u2019s profits as a percentage of total revenue. In addition to other measures, the net margin is a key indicator of a company\u2019s profitability and can be used to determine whether a business\u2019s strategy is working or whether changes to increase profitability are needed. For investors, a healthy and stable net profit margin is a positive sign of financial strength and operational efficiency.\n\nSalesforce. \"What Is Net Profit Margin, and Why Does It Matter?\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Microsoft Corporation, Form 10-Q, For the Quarterly Period Ended September 30, 2024.\" Page 3.\n\nHarvard Business School Online. \"13 Financial Performance Measures Managers Should Monitor.\"",
