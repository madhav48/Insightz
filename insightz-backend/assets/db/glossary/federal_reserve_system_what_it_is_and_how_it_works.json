Often called the Fed, it is arguably the most influential financial institution in the world. It was founded to provide the country with a safe, flexible, and stable monetary and financial system.The Fed has a board of seven members and 12 Federal Reserve banks, each operating as a separate district with its own president.\n\nThere is a common misconception that the Federal Reserve System is privately owned. In fact, it combines public and private characteristics: The central governing board of the FRS is an agency of the federal government and reports to Congress. The Federal Reserve Banks that it oversees are set up like private corporations.\n\nA central bank is a financial institution given privileged control over the production and distribution of money and credit for a nation, union, or group of countries. In modern economies, the central bank is usually responsible for formulating\u00a0monetary policy\u00a0and regulating member banks. The Fed is composed of 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks that are each responsible for a specific geographic area of the U.S.\n\nThe Fed was established by theFederal Reserve Act, which was signed by President Woodrow Wilson on Dec. 23, 1913, in response to the financial panic of 1907.Before that, the U.S. was the only major financial power without a central bank.\u00a0Its creation was precipitated by repeated financial panics that afflicted the U.S. economy over the previous century, leading to severe economic disruptions due to bank failures and business bankruptcies. A\u00a0crisis in 1907 led to calls for an institution that would prevent panics and disruptions.\n\nThe Fed has broad power to act to ensure financial stability, and it is the\u00a0primary regulator\u00a0of banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System. It also serves as the\u00a0lender of last resort\u00a0to member institutions. Often referred to simply as the Fed, it has what is often called its \"dual mandate\" of ensuring price stability and maximum employment.\n\nThe system's 12 regional Federal Banks are based in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, and San Francisco.\n\nThe monetary policygoals of the\u00a0Federal Reserveare twofold: to foster economic conditions that achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.\n\nThe Fed's duties can be further categorized into four general areas:\n\nThere are seven members of the Board of Governors. These individuals are nominated by the President and approved by the U.S. Senate. Each\u00a0governor serves a maximum of 14 years. Their\u00a0appointment\u00a0is staggered by two years, which is intended to limit the political influences it might be subjected to when control of appointments shifts to different political parties during elections.The law also dictates that appointments represent all broad sectors of the U.S. economy.\n\nAt times, there may be an empty seat on the board, but as of May 2025, all board positions were occupied.\n\nIn addition to the governors of the Fed's board, each of the 12 regional banks has a president. Each of these banks is set up in a different Federal Reserve district.\n\nCentral bank independence refers to the question of whether the overseers of monetary policy should be completely disconnected from the realm of government. Those who favor independence recognize the influence of politics in promoting monetary policy that can favor re-election in the near term but cause lasting economic damage down the road. Critics say that the central bank and government must tightly coordinate their policies and that central banks must have regulatory oversight.\n\nThe Fed\u00a0is also considered independent because its decisions do not have to be ratified by the president or any other government official. However, it is still subject to congressional oversight and must work within the framework of the government's monetary and fiscal policy objectives.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is composed of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve Banks, the Federal Open Market Committee, and all the programs created by the Fed as a whole to accomplish its dual mandate.\n\nTheFederal Open Market Committee(FOMC) is the Federal Reserve's main monetary policymaking body. It is responsible for open market operations, which is buying and selling government securities to influence the amount of money banks keep in reserve.\n\nThe FOMC includes the Board of Governors (or the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) as it's also called), the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and the presidents of four other regional Federal Reserve Banks who serve on a rotating basis.\n\nThe committee is responsible for monetary policy decisions, which are categorized into three areas: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates.\n\nThe Fed's main income source is interest charges on a range of U.S. government securities acquired through itsopen market operations(OMO). Other income sources include interest on foreign currency investments, interest on loans to depository institutions, and fees for services, such as check clearing and fund transfers, provided to these institutions. After paying expenses, the Fed transfers the rest of its earnings to the U.S. Treasury.\n\nThe Federal Reserve payments system, commonly known as the Fedwire, moves trillions of dollars daily between banks throughout the U.S. Transactions are for same-day settlement.In the aftermath of the 2008\u00a0financial crisis, the Fed has paid increased attention to the risk created by the time lag between when payments are made early in the day and when they are settled and reconciled. The Fed is pressuring large financial institutions to improve real-time monitoring of payments and\u00a0credit risk, which has been available only on an end-of-day basis.\n\nThe Fed developed a payment system calledFedNow, designed to replace the traditional and slower settlement systems. FedNow was launched in July 2023.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is designed to regulate banks and financial institutions and to maintain the stability of the country's financial system.\n\nGenerally, the president influences the Fed through appointments only. The president nominates the Federal Reserve Chair and the seven members of the Board of Governors. The Senate confirms these appointments, and they cannot easily be removed.\n\nBefore the Federal Reserve existed, the financial system was in chaos. Without it, there would be no lenders of last resort and no governance over interest rates or money supply.\n\nThe Federal Reserve sets a rate range using three figures to adjust its rate range. The rate for its Overnight Reverse Repurchase (ON RREP) Agreement Facility sets the floor for the rate range. The Fed's discount rate, or the rate it charges banks for overnight loans, sets the top number for the range. The Fed uses its Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) rate in conjunction with ON RREP to keep the effective federal funds rate in its target range. Open Market Operations are used to keep enough money in reserve so that the Fed's rates implement monetary policy.\n\nThe Federal Reserve System is the central banking system of the United States. The Fed uses the system and the tools it has to set interest rates and regulate the money supply to accomplish its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"About the Fed.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Board Members.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Structure of the Federal Reserve System.\"\n\nUnited States Senate. \"The Senate Passes the Federal Reserve Act.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Federal Reserve Act Signed into Law.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"The Fed Explained: What the Central Bank Does.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"The Twelve Federal Reserve Districts.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"What Economic Goals Does the Federal Reserve Seek to Achieve Through Its Monetary Policy?\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Who Are the Members of the Federal Reserve Board, and How Are They Selected?\"\n\nFederal Reserve System. \u201cBoard of Governors Members, 1914-Present.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve. \"Current Fed Leaders.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"About the FOMC.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Monetary Policy Principles and Practice.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago. \"The Federal Reserve's Dual Mandate.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"What Does It Mean That the Federal Reserve Is \"Independent Within the Government?\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Finance and Economics Discussion Series: Fedwire Funds Service: Payments, Balances, and Available Liquidity.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Fedwire Funds Services.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank Services. \"About the FedNow Services.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"How the Fed Implements Monetary Policy With Its Tools.\"",
