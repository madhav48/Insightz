  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA\u00a0gain is a general increase in the value of an asset or property. A gain arises if the current price of something is higher than the original purchase price. For accounting and tax purposes, gains may be classified in several ways, such as gross vs. net gains or realized vs. unrealized (paper) gains. Capital gains may additionally be classified asshort-termvs.long-termin nature.\n\nA gain can be contrasted with a loss, which occurs when property or assets held lose value compared to their purchase price. A loss can thus be construed as a negative gain.\n\nA gain refers generally to the positive difference between the price of something at acquisition and its current price. A net gain takes transaction costs and other expenses into consideration. A gain may also be either realized or unrealized. Arealized gainis the profit that is received when the asset is sold and anunrealized gain, also known as a paper gain, is an increase in value since purchase while the asset is still owned by the buyer and not yet disposed of.\n\nAnother important distinction between gains is when they are taxable or non-taxable, as taxes can have a large impact on how much of a gain actually ends up in an investor's pocket.\n\nFor investors and traders, a gain can occur anytime in the life of an asset. If an investor owns a stock purchased for $15 and the market now prices that stock at $20, then the investor is sitting on a $5 gain. That said, a gain only truly matters when the asset is sold and the gains are realized asprofit. An asset may see many unrealized gains and losses between purchase and sale because the market is constantly reassessing the value of assets.\n\nIn most jurisdictions, realized gains are subject tocapital gains tax. As well as applying to traditional assets, capital gains tax may also apply to gains inalternativeassets, such as coins, works of art, and wine collections.\n\nCapital gains tax varies depending on the type of asset,\u00a0personal income tax rate, and how long the asset gets held. Short-term gains are generally taxed asordinary income, while long-term gains (held longer than one year) are taxed more favorably.\n\nA capital gain can typically be offset by acapital loss. For instance, if\u00a0an investor realized a $50,000 capital gain in stock A and realized a $30,000 capital loss in stock B, they may only have to pay tax on the net capital gain of $20,000 ($50,000 - $30,000).\n\nIf the gains accrue in a non-taxable account\u2014such as anIndividual Retirement Accountin the U.S. or a Retirement Savings Plan in Canada\u2014gains will not be taxed.\n\nFor taxation purposes, net realized gains rather than gross gains are taken into consideration.\u00a0In a stock transaction in a taxable account, thetaxable gainwould be the difference between the sale price and purchase price, after considering brokerage commissions.\n\nHere is an example of how a taxable gain works:\n\nLegendary investor Warren Buffet attributescompoundinggains as one of the key factors to accumulating wealth. The basic concept is that gains add to existing gains.\n\nFor example, if $10,000 is invested in a stock and it gains 10% in a year, it generates $1,000. After another 10% return in the following year, the investment generates $1,100 ($11,000 x 10% gain), and after the third year of a 10% gain, the investment now generates $1,210 ($12,100 x 10% gain). Investors who start compounding gains at a young age have time on their side to build substantial wealth.\n\nTax Foundation. \"An Overview of Capital Gains Taxes.\" Accessed Sept. 25, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Traditional IRAs.\" Accessed Sept. 25, 2021.\n\nFINRA. \"Capital Gains Explained.\" Accessed Sept. 25, 2021.",
