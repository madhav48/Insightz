  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA guarantor is an individual or entity who promises to pay a debt if the main party defaults. They act as a backup source of payment if the borrower can\u2019t cover the debt.\n\n\u201cGuarantor\u201d is a financial term describing an individual who promises to pay a borrower\u2019s debt if the borrower defaults on their loan obligation. Guarantorspledge their own assetsas collateral against the loans. On rare occasions, individuals act as their own guarantors, by pledging their own assets against the loan.\n\nThe term \u201cguarantor\u201d is often interchanged with the term \u201csurety.\u201d\n\nA guarantor is typically over the age of 18 andresides in the countrywhere the payment agreement occurs. Guarantors generally exhibit exemplarycredit historiesand sufficientincometo cover the loan payments if and when the borrowerdefaults, at which time the guarantor\u2019sassetsmay be seized by the lender. And if the borrower chronically makes payments late, the guarantor may be on the hook for additionalinterestowed or penalty costs.\n\nThere are many different scenarios in which a guarantor would need to be used. This ranges from assisting people with poor credit histories to simply assisting those without a high-enough income. Guarantors also don\u2019t necessarily need to be liable for the entire monetary obligation in the guarantee. Below are different situations that would require a guarantor, as well as the type of guarantor in a specific guarantee.\n\nIn addition to pledging their assets as collateral against loans, guarantors may also help individuals land jobs and secure passport documents. In these situations, guarantors certify that they personally know the applicants and corroborate their identities by confirming photo IDs.\n\nAs defined under the terms of the loan agreement, a guarantor can either be limited or unlimited concerning timetables and levels of financial involvement. Case in point: A limited guarantor may be asked to guarantee aloanonly up to a certain time, after which the borrower alone assumes responsibility for the remaining payments and suffers the consequences of defaulting.\n\nA limited guarantor may also only be responsible for backing a certain percentage of the loan, referred to as a penal sum. This differs from unlimited guarantors, who are liable for the entire amount of the loan throughout the entire duration of the contract.\n\nGuarantors aren\u2019t solely used by borrowers with poor credit histories. Pointedly, landlords frequently require first-time property renters to provide lease guarantors. This commonly occurs with college students whose parents assume the role of the guarantor, in case the tenant is unable to make the rent or prematurely breaks theleaseagreement.\n\nA guarantor differs from aco-signer, who co-owns the asset, and whose name appears on titles. Co-signer arrangements typically occur when the borrower\u2019s qualifying income is less than the figure stipulated in the lender\u2019s requirement. This differs from guarantors, who step in only when borrowers have sufficient income but are thwarted by lousy credit histories. Co-signers share ownership of an asset, while guarantors have no claim to the asset purchased by the borrower.\n\nHowever, in the event the borrower has a claim against a third party that has caused the default, the guarantor has the right to invoke a process calledsubrogation(\u201cstep into the shoes of the borrower\u201d) to recover damages.\n\nFor example, in a rental agreement, a co-signer would be responsible for the rent from day one, whereas a guarantor would only be responsible for the rent if the renter fails to make a payment. This also applies to any loan. Guarantors are only notified when the borrower defaults, not for any payment before that.\n\nIn the event of a default, the guarantor\u2019s credit history may be adversely affected, which may limit their chances of securing loans in the future.\n\nIn essence, a co-signer takes on more financial responsibility than a guarantor does, asa co-signer is equally responsiblefrom the onset of the agreement, whereas a guarantor is only responsible once the primary party to the contract fails to meet their obligation.\n\nIn an agreement with a guarantor, the advantages usually lie with the primary party in the contract, whereas the disadvantages usually lie with the guarantor. Having a guarantor means that the loan or agreement has a higher and much quicker chance of being approved. Most likely, it can allow for borrowing more and receiving a betterinterest rate. However, loans with guarantors tend to have higher interest rates.\n\nIn a rental agreement, one way to avoid needing a guarantor is by paying a few months ofrentupfront if you are in a position to do so.\n\nThe disadvantages lie with the guarantor. If the person you are guaranteeing fails to pay their obligations, then you are on the hook for the amount. If you are not in a financial situation to make the payments, then you are still liable for the amount, yourcredit scorewill be negatively impacted, and legal action may be taken against you. Also, if you guarantee a loan, then your ability to borrow additional money for something else is limited because you are tied to an existing obligation.\n\nHelps a borrower obtain a loan or a rental much easier\n\nAllows for the ability to borrow a higher amount\n\nCan help the borrower improve their credit history\n\nGuarantor may be liable for the outstanding obligation\n\nGuarantor\u2019s credit score could be negatively impacted\n\nAbility to obtain another loan for separate use is limited\n\nThough the terms are used interchangeably, they are different. A co-signer takes on equal responsibility in an agreement, co-owns the asset, and is responsible for payments from the start of the agreement. A guarantor is only responsible for payments once the primary party of the agreement defaults and is then notified by the lender. A co-signer has more financial responsibility than a guarantor.\n\nA parent can act as a guarantor and often does for a child for their child\u2019s first rental property, as the child\u2019s income is usually not high enough at a young age.\n\nDifferent agreements and different lenders have different requirements for a guarantor. At the minimum, a guarantor will need to have a high credit score without any issues in theircredit report. They will also have to have an income that is a certain multiple of the monthly or annual payments.\n\nThere is no specific amount that an individual needs to earn to be a guarantor. The amount relates directly to the loan in question or the rent on a property. For rental agreements,landlordsusually expect the guarantor to have an annual income that is at least 40 times the monthly rent.\n\nIf a guarantor cannot pay, both they and the tenant are liable for the obligations. Thelenderwill begin collection proceedings against both the guarantor and the tenant, which will adversely impact the credit profile of both.\n\nA guarantor is an individual who agrees to pay a borrower\u2019s debt if the borrower defaults on their obligation. A guarantor is not a primary party to the agreement but is considered to be an additional comfort for a lender. A guarantor will have a strong credit score and earn sufficient income to meet the obligation.\n\nHaving a guarantor on a loan agreement greatly benefits the borrower. It allows for an agreement to be approved much faster and often at a higher amount.\n\nIn the event a borrower defaults, the guarantor must meet the obligation. If they do not, they are still liable and can have a lawsuit brought against them for the outstanding amount. They will also see a negative hit on their credit score.",
