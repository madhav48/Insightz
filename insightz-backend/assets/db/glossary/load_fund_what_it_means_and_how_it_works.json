  "term": "Load Fund: What it Means and how it Works",
  "definition": "A load fund is a mutual fund that comes with asales chargeor commission. The fund investor pays the load, which goes to compensate a sales intermediary, such as abroker,financial planner, or investment advisor, for his time and expertise in selecting an appropriate fund for the investor. The load is either paid upfront at the time of purchase (front-end load), when the shares are sold (back-end load), or as long as the fund is held by the investor (level-load). Load funds may be contrasted withno-load funds, which do not carry a sales charge.\n\nIf a fund limits itslevel loadto no more than 0.25% (the maximum is 1%) it can call itself a \"no-load\" fund in its marketing literature. Front-end andback-end loadsare not part of a mutual fund'soperating expensesand are typically paid out to the selling broker and the broker-dealer as a commission. However, level-loads, called12b-1 fees, are included as operating expenses. Funds that do not charge a load are called no-load funds, which are typically sold directly by the mutual fund company or through their partners.\n\nInvestors may automatically assume no-load funds are the better choice over load funds, but that may not be the case. Fees on load funds go to pay the investor or fund manager who does research and makes investment decisions on the client's behalf. These experts can sort through mutual funds and help investors make smart investment decisions they may not have the skill or knowledge to make on their own. Paying upfront fees can also eliminate the need to sap investment returns by paying continual expense fees on the returns the fund achieves.\n\nThe main disadvantage, of course, is the load itself. No-load mutual funds now exist as options that carry no sales charge.\n\nIn the 1970s, mutual fund companies came under criticism for the high front-end sales loads they charged along with excessive fees and other hidden charges. As a result, they introduced multiple share classes giving investors several options for paying sales charges.",
