  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nGBP is the abbreviation for the British pound sterling, the official currency of the United Kingdom, the British Overseas Territories of South Georgia, the South Sandwich Islands, and British Antarctic Territory and the U.K. crown dependencies, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.\n\nThe British pound sterling is symbolized by the pound sign (\u00a3) and is sometimes referred to as \u201csterling\u201d or by the nickname \u201cquid.\u201d\n\nThe British pound competes with the U.S. dollar (USD),euro (EUR), andJapanese yen (JPY)in daily volume trading. The most commoncurrency pairsinvolving the British pound are the euro (EUR/GBP) and the U.S. dollar (GBP/USD).GBP/USDis referred to ascableby foreign exchange traders.\n\nThe penny sterling or pence is 1/100th of a pound. Many stocks are traded in pence rather than in pounds. Stock exchanges may use GBX to indicate pence. Though the official name of GBP is pound sterling, \u201csterling\u201d or STG may be used more commonly in accounting orforeign exchange (forex)settings.\n\nCurrenciespeggedto the British pound include the Falkland Islands pound, Gibraltar pound, Saint Helena pound, Jersey pound (JEP), Guernsey pound (GGP), Manx pound, Scotland notes, and Northern Ireland notes.\n\nThe GBP, or British pound sterling, is the oldest activelegal tenderin the world.\n\nThe British pound became the official currency of the United Kingdom when England and Scotland united to form a single country in 1707, but the pound was used as a form of money in the year 760.Until 1855, when printing began, theBank of Englandwrote all banknotes by hand.\n\nThe British pound served as currency in the colonies of the British Empire, including Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many countries tied the value of their currencies to the price of gold. Thegold standardoffered a uniform way to determine value among world currencies. Before World War I, the United Kingdom used the gold standard to set the value of the British pound.\n\nAt the outbreak of World War I, the country abandoned the gold standard, then reinstated it in post-war 1925, only to abandon it again during theGreat Depression. In 1971, the United Kingdom allowed the British pound tofloatfreely, allowing market forces to determine its value. In 2002, when the euro became the common currency of most European Union (EU) member nations, the U.K. kept the GBP as its official currency. This turned out to be a good decision for the U.K., as it officially left the EU in 2020.\n\nIn a June 2016 referendum, British voters supported a measure to leave the European Union through a process calledBrexit.The GBP declined significantly upon the U.K.\u2019s split from the EU, andthe value fluctuatedin response to trade negotiations.\n\nThe pound sterling declined again in Sept. 2022 after Prime MinisterLiz Trussannounced economic policies on tax cuts. Although the Truss government aimed to boost U.K. economic productivity, investors and forex traders were concerned that tax cuts would increase already-high inflation and debt. The GBP/USD sank to an all-time low of 1.03 on Sept. 26, 2022.\n\nThe Spring Budget 2024, delivered by UK Chancellor Jeremy Hunt, introduced several key changes aimed at boosting economic growth and reducing the tax burden on individuals. Major announcements include cuts to National Insurance contributions, the abolition of the \"non-dom\" tax regime, the introduction of a UK ISA, and changes to capital gains tax on residential property. The budget also outlined transitional arrangements for existing non-doms and announced the launch of British savings bonds. These measures are designed to stimulate investment, create jobs, and lower taxes, potentially impacting the UK economy and the value of the British pound in the coming years.\n\nThe Bank of England plays a big part role in influencing the value of GBP through its monetary policy decisions. As the central bank of the United Kingdom, the BoE is responsible for setting interest rates, controlling inflation, and ensuring financial stability.\n\nThe bank's primary tool for affecting GBP is the base interest rate, which influences borrowing costs and overall economic activity. When the BoE raises interest rates, it makes borrowing more expensive, which tends to slow down consumer spending and reduce inflationary pressures. Conversely, lowering rates can stimulate economic growth by encouraging borrowing and spending. As of September 2024, the Bank of England held interest rates at 5%.\n\nIn addition to interest rate policies, the Bank of England also uses quantitative easing (QE) to influence GBP. QE involves the BoE purchasing government bonds and other securities to inject liquidity into the economy, encouraging lending and investment. A higher supply of GBP in circulation tends to reduce its value compared to other currencies. For example, the Bank of England infused billions of GBP into the economy during the pandemic.\n\nYes. The official name of the U.K. currency is pound sterling, but it is often called the British pound or sterling.\n\nReportedly, the U.K.'s currency evolved from sterling silver pennies that were used in the late 700's.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be a definitive answer, similar to the dollar being referred to as \"buck.\" Some believe it originates from quid pro quo, Latin for \"something for something,\" while others think it came from Quidhampton, where there was once aroyal paper mill.\n\nThe GBP\u2060, or British pound sterling, is the official currency of the United Kingdom.
