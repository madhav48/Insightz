  "definition": "A warranty deed is a legal real estate document that protects the buyer and ensures that the seller holds a cleartitleto the property, has no outstanding liens or mortgages, and there will be no future claim to the title of the property.\n\nThe two parties involved in a warranty deed are the seller, known as the grantor, and the buyer, or the grantee, and either party can be an individual or a business.\n\nMostlendersrequire a warranty deed for properties they finance.\n\nA deed is a legal document that transfersreal estate propertyfrom one entity\u00a0to another as a seller to a buyer. During a real estate transaction, a title company provides a full title search of current and past ownership of the property to see if there are any defects or issues affecting the title during past ownership of the property.\n\nA warranty deed holds the seller, or grantor, responsible for any breach after the title search, even if the breach occurred without their knowledge or during a period before the grantor owned the property. It ensures that the buyer will not be responsible for any past title defects orencumbrances.\n\nThe warranty deed is delivered to the grantee during theclosing of the sale. It contains an accurate legal description of the property being conveyed, is signed and witnessed following the state law where the property is located, contains legal words of conveyance that the seller is granting the property to the buyer, and shows proof of the amount of money or consideration paid for the property.\n\n\u2022 The grantor warrants that they are the rightful owner of the property and have the legal right to transfer the title of the property in a sale.\n\n\u2022 The grantor warrants that the property is free and clear of all liens and that there are no outstanding claims on the property from a creditor who may claim it as collateral.\n\n\u2022 A guarantee that the title can withstand any third-party claims to ownership\u00a0of the property.\n\n\u2022 Conveys that the grantor holds the title and there has been noencumbranceof the property during the grantor\u2019s ownership period of the property.\n\n\u2022 The grantor does not guarantee against any defects inclear titlethat existed before they took possession of the property.\n\nA real estate agent or real estate lawyer can help both buyers and sellers obtain a warranty deed. Whether buying or selling a property, a warranty deed can guarantee against problems with the title.\n\nAs a seller or grantor, having a warranty deed in place will give potential buyers some assurance concerning the property. A buyer will likely look for the highest level of protection and peace of mind when investing in real estate. If there are no outstanding liens or claims on the title of the property, a warranty deed can lead to a mutually successful transaction.\n\nA title company completes a title search and examines public records for any issues or errors. The guarantees and disclosures in a general warranty deed allow the new owner to hold the former owner responsible if there is a title defect or if a claim is made against the title. Title insurance covers a wider range of potential claims than the general warranty deed does, including conflicting estatewillsortax liens.\n\nA buyer, or new owner, will be protected from previous owner's fines issued because of code violations, or if a previous owner failed to payHOAfees.\n\nUnlike a general warranty deed, the seller is not liable for any title issues that could have occurred before they took ownership. This creates a risk for a buyer because they will have no legal protection for any potential title issues that could arise after the real estate transaction is complete.\n\nA warranty deed is a real estate document that ensures that the property has a clear title and the seller has no outstanding liens or mortgages. A combination of a warranty deed, a title search, and title insurance provides the highest protection to a buyer of real estate and ensures that defects in the title do not exist and that there will be no future claims to the property title.",
