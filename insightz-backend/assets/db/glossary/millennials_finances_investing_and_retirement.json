  "term": "Millennials: Finances, Investing, and Retirement",
  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nMillennials are the generation that came of age near the dawn of the 21st century\u2014the new millennium. As the first to be born into a digital world, members of this group are considereddigital natives. Technology has always been a part of their everyday lives\u2014it\u2019s been estimated that they check their phones as many as 150 times daily\u2014and serving them has been a major contributing factor to the growth of Silicon Valley and other technology hubs.\n\nThe Pew Research Center defines millennials as those born from 1981 to 1996, although researchers include those born as early as 1980 or as late as 2004.Also known as Generation Y (Gen Y),\u00a0the millennial generation follows Generation X (Gen X) and is followed by Generation Z (Gen Z). In terms of numbers,\u00a0it has edged out the baby boomers as the most significant generation in American history.\n\nResearch has shown the millennial generation to be the most ethnically and racially diverse in U.S. history. Gen Y tends to be progressive in their political views and voting habits and less religiously observant than their predecessors,Gen X.\n\nMillennials face the most uncertain economic future of any generation in America since theGreat Depression. Three decades of stagnant wages were followed by theGreat Recession(which\u00a0left more than 15% of those in their early 20s out of work). They then came the coronavirus pandemic, which upended the financial and housing markets plus impacted employment across multiple sectors.\n\nThe job market\u00a0has improved since the recession and rebounded since the pandemic. Still, millennials and everyone else face wage stagnation, thanks\u00a0in part to a 20-year trend of decreasing labor market mobility. Labor market mobility started to stagnate in 2000, just as the oldest millennials entered the job market.When workers don\u2019t move around, from both job to job and region to region, employers have more power when negotiating wages\u2014a phenomenon called monopsony\u2014which translates into employees getting paid less.\n\nUnfortunately for young people whose careers coincided with this trend, it\u2019s difficult to make up lostearningsfrom early, slow years. Add to this financial reality the record amount of debt (mainly from student loans) that this generation is carrying, and there is one reason for financial stress.\n\nHowever,millennials have been working hardas they entered their thirties. According to a 2021 quarterly report, Millennials live in the present. They focus on their immediate financial well-being by maintaining a budget setting up emergency funds. As a whole, they lead by the most significant margins on long-range financial goals.\n\nThe increasing wealth gap has meant that millennials start with lesshousehold income. So, their most popular personal finance priority is to have enough money for day-to-day living expenses. During the recession, some millennials postponed getting higher education or additional degrees due to a sluggish job market.\n\nAs the job market improved, many millennials chose the gig economy. When the pandemic hit and social distancing regulations were implemented, many millennials found their jobs went remote. And many millennials \"flourished,\" and 74% of millennials didn't plan to return to the workplace five days a week, according to a 2020 Gallup poll.\n\nOf course, some millennials struggle to land full-time positions and are making do with part-time positions, but overall, this group is earning more than other generations. According to the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median income for someone aged 25 to 34\u2014which roughly approximates the millennial generation\u2014was $82,000 in 2022.\n\nAs many younger millennials and Generation Z, their younger siblings, do, living paycheck to paycheck doesn\u2019t make financial independence easy. Gaining independence should be income-driven rather than frugality-fueled. While spending frivolously is never advisable, cutting back on your Starbucks\u00a0intake isn\u2019t going to make your fortune. Accumulating wealth requires broader, long-term thinking.\n\nFor instance, if you\u2019re making $30,000 a year, it will be nearly impossible to amass a large sum of money\u2014even if you were to save all of your extra pennies. For instance, broadening your earning capacity\u2014via education or work experience\u2014can help increase your worth and broaden your income horizons.\n\nPaying offstudent loan debthas become increasingly difficult, even for those with a job. While it\u2019s natural to prioritize paying off debt as soon as possible, that may not be the best course. You need to have your money working for you, too.\n\nOne approach is to leverage what funds you have: Extend your college loan repayment period to lower your monthly payments and use the extra cash to start building a retirement nest egg. In your 20s, you\u2019re at thetime when compound interest is most in your favorbecause you have decades for even small amounts of money to grow.\u00a0It\u2019s also a good time to take risks because if an investment does tank, then your portfolio has time to recover from losses.\n\nAlso, being in debt is not all bad. Particular sorts of installment debt\u2014like student or auto loans\u2014can be helpful. As long as you pay them in a timely and regular fashion, they help you establish a good credit history. You need a good history and credit score to obtain everything from a residential lease to a bank loan (and the most favorable interest rate possible for it). Not only is it OK to have the right kind of debt, but it can also make a lot of financial sense. Take a basiccapital investment, such as a car. You could obtain a low-interest auto loan and pay it off in small, regular installments while more of your cash remains available to put toward something else.\n\nPaying your monthly credit card bills on time is crucial to building your credit rating. Try to pay your bill in full at the end of each month to avoid racking up interest charges that can quickly snowball. Also, having several cards (but not owing anything close to your credit limit\u2014charge no more than 35% of your limit on each card) will help your credit utilization ratio. This percentage is another important factor when being evaluated for a car loan or a mortgage.\n\nThe net worth gulf between the rich and themiddle classhas been at its highest level since 1941, as well.\n\nSaving for big-ticket items, like a home of one's own, is another goal. Unfortunately,lendersare imposing stricter guidelines for significant types of financing, especially mortgages. Therefore, millennials may need to make a substantial down paymentif they want to purchase a home. Most savings accounts do not provide a high yield on returns, which means you could lose money over time if the interest rates don't pace with inflation.\n\nSavings accountscause you to lose money over timebecause their low interest rates do not keep pace with inflation. They're also subject to maintenance fees that can nibble away at your balance. It's not terrible to keep a small emergency fund in the bank\u2014after all, it's still Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured\u2014but the bulk of savings should be elsewhere.\n\nMillennials often see their career trajectories and retirement differently from their parents and grandparents saw theirs. Frequently dubbed the \u201cinstant gratification generation,\u201d they don\u2019t want to work first for a big company and later try to do their own thing and enjoy life. They want to pursue ambitions now, whether going for a dream job right out of college, working for someone else\u2019s promising startup, or creating a location-independent business. They want a job that allows an outstanding work/life balance while they\u2019re young, so they don\u2019t have to wait to travel, create their ownnonprofit, or pursue hobbies. They may even be planning not to retire because they love their work.\n\nAnother smart financial move is buyinglong-term disability insurancewhile you\u2019re young and healthy, which qualifies you for better premiums.\n\nMany millennials see themselves working forever, but not because they expect to be forced into that situation by a bad economy or poor financial planning. They envision a lifelong career because of their passion for what they do.\n\n\"I have taken a very different approach than my parents,\" said Michael Solari,Certified Financial Plannerand principal withSolari Financial Planning, a New Hampshire-based, fee-only financial planning firm with offices in Bedford and Nashua, NH. \"Initially, when I got out of college, I took the normal path working for a large company, but after I got laid off in 2009, I decided to take my career into my own hands. I love financial planning, so I started working toward creating my own firm.\" Solari's company caters to young professionals. \"I'm so happy with my decision, and I plan to work until I can't physically,\" he said.\n\nThe firm provides Solari the ability to create his schedule to give him a work/life balance, which is most important because he observed his parents being strapped to their companies. \"Retirement is for people who are unhappy with their careers,\" he adds.\n\nEven if you're planning to work throughout your life, you still need to save for retirement; you also need a safety net in case you can't work forever because of illness or disability\u2014or because you're pushed out of your job and can't find another. And if you change your mind one day, you'll appreciate having the flexibility that retirement savings will give you. Investing in the stock market, using ladder CDs, or opening a high-yield money market account, are all ways to grow your money. Investing $100 per month in the stock market for the next 30 years would give you approximately $122,000, assuming a 7% return.\n\nYou would thinkretirement planningwould be a no-brainer for this young group, which has watched parents and grandparents struggle so much with recessions, saving money, and real estate booms and busts. They should know that Social Security and company pension plans areno longer reliable retirement income options\u2014especially the latter, as private-sector employers eschew defined-benefit plans in favor of defined-contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, which shift much, if not all, of the savings burden onto the employee.\n\nStill, this is not the case for all millennials and their families. Some of them used retirement accounts when they lost their jobs during the pandemic, which impacted employment and housing for millions of Americans.\n\nMillennials areplanning for their future, but not enough of them. Approximately 21% of millennials do not have a job that provides an employer-sponsored retirement plan, according to a 2021 Transamerica study.\n\nAnother cause for concern: A full 70% of the folks surveyed believed that once they\u2019re retirees, they\u2019ll be able to survive on $36,000 a year.According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the problem with this perception is that in 2022, the average yearly expenses for those ages 65 to 74 were $60,844 a year.\n\nIf you even saved up enough to live on $36,000 a year from a retirement account, it will likely not be enough. \u201cWith the cost of goods, food, and housing at such inflated prices now, millennials will not be able to live off of $36,000 a year in retirement,\u201d said Carlos Dias Jr., founder and managing partner ofDias Wealth LLCin Lake Mary, FL. \u201dBased on an inflation rate of 3%, the value of $36,000 today will be reduced to $14,831.52 in 30 years.\u201d The disparity in perceived retirement funding needs could easily lead to financial pain for retirement-age millennials.\n\nMillennials who invest in the stock market may see a rosier retirement picture. Over the long haul, the stock market has producedreturn rateshovering in the 10% range, and those who start investing while young benefit from those extra years.\n\nLiving a partially retired lifestyle is the most moderate approach. You will probably need a part-time job with a decent salary that allows you to work less and continue saving for the future. You might achieve this goal throughfreelancingon your schedule or by running or working for a location-independent business that lets you combine work and travel or hobbies.\n\nYour long-term saving and investment strategy should be based on whether you want. Do you aspire to a partial retirement plus working forever as a freelancer, or partial retirement now plus a conventional retirement down the road? These are questions to ask yourself before leaving a full-time job.\n\nThose considering any form of early retirement need to perform a considerable amount of research and consider numerous variables to ensure its financial feasibility. In addition toextensively planning aheadto live frugally, it\u2019s crucial to still have enough money set aside in the form of an emergency fund. Individuals who don\u2019t account for unexpected expenses in their budgets may find their retirement plans derailed by a single car accident or injury.\n\nWhile millennials can sometimes be wary about investing, the availability of social media tools is making it easier and more comfortable for this age group to learn. To ensure that they do not experience the same problems as previous generations, millennials are approaching investing inan entirely different mannerfrom parents and grandparents.\n\nGiven their love for anything tech-related, it should come as little surprise that millennials are taking advantage of a variety of high-tech and social media tools that allow them to plow their wealth into the investment vehicles of their choice. They are now leveraging social networking platforms, websites, and mobile apps to do everything from following stock-picking tips to finding financial planners. All it takes is clicks on an app for millennials to review a prospectus, get advice, and even commit funds\u2014and they reward companies that let them do so. Factors such associal responsibilityand\u00a0environmental responsibility also frequently play a crucial role in millennials' money.\n\nMillennials are also more likely to take advantage of online tools for monitoring their investments. With such tools, investors can review their portfolios anytime they desire rather than waiting forquarterly reportsto arrive in the mail\u2014and this group takes full advantage. Sixty-one percent of millennials approved of robo-advisors for investing their money.\n\nMillennials are comfortable with digital banking and robo-advisors, as they came of age during the technology boom. Millennials use a variety of apps, including.\n\nAccording to the Pew Research Center, \u201cmillennial\u201d applies to anyone born from 1981 through 1996.\n\nMillennials are so named due to them being the first generation to come of age in the new millennium, according to the Pew Research Institute. The term Generation Y (Gen Y) is also used in reference to this generation, due to them following Generation X (Gen X).\n\nAccording to 2020 data from the\u00a0U.S. Census Bureau, millennials earn a pretax income of $71,566 in their households.\n\nAt the end of the day, many millennials areplanning for retirement, even if it looks a little different than their parents' or grandparents' post-work lives. For some, working extra hard by building passive income streams, like investing in real estate, may help cushion the potential for early or partial retirement. Other millennials whodon't anticipate a robust financial exitfrom their jobs may incorporate travel and enjoyable activities throughout their working life.\n\nMillennials who weathered the recession or watched their parents' struggle may have values that force them to be mindful of how they spend, focusing ondiscretionary income, taking at least one vacation each year, and pursuing different activities and experiences as often as they can. Overall, as a generation, data shows most millennials are presentlysaving for retirementand remaining hopeful about their financial futures.\n\nQualtrics. \u201cMillennials and Technology at Home,\u201d Page 2.\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cDefining Generations: Where Millennials End and Generation Z Begins.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cMillennials in Adulthood.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cFor Young Americans, Unemployment Returns to Pre-Recession Levels.\u201d\n\nRoosevelt Institute. \u201cDeclining Entrepreneurship, Labor Mobility, and Business Dynamism: A Demand-Side Approach: Executive Summary,\u201d Pages 1\u20132.\n\nBloomberg. \u201cMillennials Are Running Out of Time to Build Wealth.\u201d\n\nMorning Consult. \"State of Consumer Banking & Payments.\"\n\nGallup. \"Will Millennials Finally Get the Workplace They Want?\"\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data. \"Wages and Salaries by Age: 25 to 34.\"\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cFor Young Americans, Unemployment Returns to Pre-Recession Levels.\u201d\n\nWorld Inequality Database. \u201cIncome Inequality, USA, 1913\u20132021.\u201d\n\nTransamerica Center for Retirement Studies. \"Living in the COVID-19 Pandemic: the Health, Finances, and Retirement Prospects of Four Generations,\" Page 28-29.\n\nInsured Retirement Institute and The Center for Generational Kinetics. \u201cWill Millennials Ever Be Able to Retire?,\u201d Page 10.\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data: \"Total Average Annual Expenditures by Age: 65 to 74.\"\n\nVanguard. \"Generational views on financial advice, investing, and retirement.\"\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cThe Whys and Hows of Generations Research.\u201d\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"Income and Poverty in the United States: 2020.
