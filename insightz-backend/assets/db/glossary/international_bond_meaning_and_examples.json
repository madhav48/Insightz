  "definition": "International investing involves selecting global investment instruments as part of a diversified portfolio. People often invest internationally to increase thediversificationof their portfolios and spread investment risk among foreign markets and companies.\n\nInternational investing provides investors with a broader investment universe for selecting portfolio selections. It can broaden an investor\u2019s diversification, potentially adding new sources of return. In some cases, it can also help mitigate some systematic risks associated with a specific country\u2019s economy.\n\nInternational investing provides a wide range of eligible instruments for an investment portfolio beyond just domestic investments.

Emerging markets are often a category in high demand for international investors. These markets have higher risks due to their emerging growth but have greater potential for returns.\n\nMSCI is an index provider that is well known for its international indexes and provides global indexes such as theMSCI All Country World Index, the MSCI EAFE Index, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, and the MSCI Frontier Markets Index.\n\nAll types of investments involve risk and international investing may include the following:",
