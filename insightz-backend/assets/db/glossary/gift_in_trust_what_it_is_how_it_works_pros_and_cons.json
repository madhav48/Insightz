  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA gift in trust is an indirect way to give assets to a beneficiary.\n\nA gift in trust is a special legal andfiduciaryarrangement that allows for an indirectbequestof assets to a beneficiary. The purpose of a gift in trust is to avoid gift/estate taxes, as there is alifetime gift/estate tax exemptionlimit. For 2025, that limit is $13.99 million.There's also an annual gift exclusion limit\u2014the most you can give in 2025 without reporting it to the IRS (or it counting against your lifetime limit), which is $19,000.This type of trust is commonly used to transfer wealth to the next generation.\n\nGifts in trust are commonly used by parents or grandparents who want to establish atrust fundfor their children or grandchildren. Establishing a trust is anestate planningstrategy that can be used to pass assets or wealth from thegrantor\u2014the owner of theassetscreating the trust\u2014to a beneficiary who receives the wealth.\n\nTypically, theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)taxes the distribution of assets from anestateif the value of the assets is more than a specific amount called the annual estate tax exemption amount. This amount is $13.99 million for calendar year 2025 and $13.61 million for 2024. The annual gift tax exclusion amount\u2014the most you can give to another person without reporting it to the IRS\u2014is $19,000 in 2025. Any gifts over that amount must be reported to the IRS, and they count against your lifetime gift tax/exemption amount ($13.99 million in 2025).\n\nA gift in trust is a viable method of avoiding gift/estate taxes. By establishing a trust, such as a Crummey trust, you can give assets to beneficiaries in excess of the annual gift tax exclusion amount without it counting against your lifetime exemption amount.\n\nA gift to a Crummey trust allows a beneficiary to withdraw the assets for a limited time, which makes the gift considered to be a present interest and eligible for the gift tax exclusion. If the gift did not have these limited-time withdrawal rights, it would be considered a future interest and be subject togift taxes.\n\nFor example, the trust could be set up so that the beneficiary can make withdrawals within a set time period, such as within 60 or 90 days. After that, the gift\u00a0funds held in the trust fall under the stipulated withdrawal rules as set by the trust's grantor.\n\nFor example, let's say a parent designates that a child can't access their trust fund until they turn 21. Even if the child decides to tap into the trust immediately, they only have access to the most recent gift, as all previous gift funds remain protected within the trust account.\n\nACrummey provisioncan also be housed within another type of trust. For example, traditional life insurance trusts often contain a Crummey provision.\n\nIn addition to tax benefits, a gift in trust is one method of establishing a financial cushion for future generations.Transferring wealthfrom one generation to the next via awillor other means of inheritance is a complicated endeavor. At the same time, these rules can bring enormous benefits to individuals, families, and communities. Understanding the nuances of gifting can bring added value to both grantors and beneficiaries.\n\nOne potential drawback to a gift in trust is that providing beneficiaries\u2014in particular, children\u2014with immediate access to sizable sumsmay jeopardize the fund's ability to accumulate long-term wealth. Some families bypass this by setting restrictions, such as limiting the amount or frequency of withdrawals or ending future gifts to recipients who withdraw funds immediately.\n\nThe most amount of money that you can give to another person in 2025 without reporting it to the IRS\u2014that is, the gift tax exclusion amount\u2014is $19,000. (In 2024, it was $18,000.) This is also the maximum amount you can give without the gift counting against your lifetime exemption amount (see below).\n\nThe most amount you can give during your lifetime or leave to beneficiaries in your estate after you die without paying lifetime gift / estate taxes\u2014that is, the lifetime gift / estate tax exemption amount\u2014is $13.99 million in 2025. (In 2024, it was $13.61 million.)\n\nA trust is a legal arrangement where a grantor entrusts a trustee with assets for a beneficiary. At some point, typically upon the grantor's death, the assets are distributed to the beneficiary.\n\nWith a gift in trust, assets can be transferred based on the grantor's wishes, meaning limitations can be established so that the recipient can access the money only when the stipulated instructions outlined in the trust have been met. For example, a parent might establish a trust in which the funds can't be accessed by the child until their 21st birthday. If you have questions about setting up a trust and its potential for avoiding gift/estate taxes, consult with an estate planning attorney.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nThe National Law Review. \"Trust Protection for Gifts to Children and Grandchildren.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"Description of Revenue Provisions Contained in the President's Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Proposal.\"",
