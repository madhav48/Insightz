  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nDaniel Rathburn is an editor at Investopedia who works on tax, accounting, regulatory, and cryptocurrency content.\n\nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) are costs incurred by an insurance company that cannot be attributed to the processing of a specific claim. They are among\u00a0the expenses\u00a0for which\u00a0an insurer has to set aside reserve funds, in addition toallocated loss adjustment expensesandcontingent commissions.\n\nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses combined with allocated loss adjustment expenses represent an insurer's estimate of the money it will pay out in claims in addition to the expenses associated with processing the claims.\n\nAllocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE)\u00a0are expenses\u00a0linked directly to the processing of a specific claim. Insurers that use third parties to investigate the veracity of claims or to act as loss adjusters may include this expense in its allocated loss adjustment expenses.\n\nULAE expenses are more general and may include overhead and salaries. The most common expenses fall into the categories of operations and field adjusters.\n\nBecause unallocated loss adjustment expenses do not apply to a specific claim, there's no\u00a0loss date or report date for them. This makes calculations tricky. Any of several methods are available for calculating ULAE:\n\nLiability policies may contain a clause that allows the insurer to charge the client for some unallocated loss adjustment expenses.\n\nThe process of loss reserve development requires the insurer to adjust estimates to its loss and loss-adjustment expense\u00a0reserves over a period of time. Analysts can determine how accurate an insurance company has been at estimating its reserves by examining itsloss reservedevelopment.\n\nSome liability policies contain a clause, called an endorsement, that requires the policyholder to reimburse the insurance company for unallocated or allocated loss adjustment expenses. These expenses may include fees charged by attorneys, investigators, experts, arbitrators, mediators, and other costs incidental to adjusting a claim.\n\nIt is important to carefully read the\u00a0endorsement language, which\u00a0may say that a loss adjustment expense\u00a0is not intended to include the policyholder\u2019s attorney fees and\u00a0costs if an\u00a0insurer denies coverage and a\u00a0policyholder successfully sues the insurer.\n\nIn this situation, the insurance company has done no actual adjusting\u00a0of the claim, and should not be entitled to apply its deductible to the expenses incurred by the policyholder in defending the claim denied by the\u00a0insurance company.",
