Operational activities are those tasks that must be undertaken from day to day to operate the business and generate revenue. Operating expenses are different from expenses relating to, for example, investing in projects and borrowing.\n\nOperating expenses can differ according to what a company does. In fact, some activities (and expenses) might be considered operational in one industry but not so in another. It's important to understand the distinction due to the tax-deductibility of operating expenses. Some common types of operating expenses include:\n\nOne of the responsibilities that management must contend with is determining how to reduce operating expenses without significantly affecting a firm's ability to compete with its competitors.\n\nOperating expenses are necessary and unavoidable for most businesses.\u00a0Some firms successfully reduce operating expenses to gain a competitive advantage and increaseearnings.\u00a0However, reducing operating expenses can also compromise the integrity and quality of operations.\u00a0Finding the right balance can be difficult but can yield significant rewards.\n\nAnincome statementtracks the income and expenses of a company over a certain period to provide an image of its profitability.

The most common types of non-operating expenses are interest charges or other costs of borrowing and losses on the disposal of assets. Accountants sometimes remove non-operating expenses to examine the performance of the business, ignoring the effects offinancing and other irrelevant issues.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)allows businesses to deduct operating expenses if the business operates to earn profits. However, the IRS and most accounting principles distinguish between operating expenses and capital expenditures.\n\nHere's a look at a simple income statement that shows the operating expenses for a company.\n\nSource: Harvard Business School Online\n\nAbbreviated asCapEx, capital expenditures are purchases that a business makes as an investment.\u00a0Capital expenditures include costs related to acquiring, maintaining, or upgrading tangible and intangible assets. Tangible business assets include real estate, factory equipment, computers, office furniture, and other physical capital assets. Intangible assets include intellectual property, copyrights, patents, and trademarks.\n\nThe IRS treats capital expenses differently than it treats operating expenses. According to the IRS, operating expenses must be ordinary (common and accepted in the business trade) and necessary (helpful and appropriate in the business trade).\u00a0In general, businesses are allowed to write off operating expenses for the year in which the expenses were incurred. Alternatively, businesses mustcapitalizecapital expenses/costs.\n\nFor example, if a business spends $100,000 on payroll, it can write off the entirety of that expense the year it is incurred, but if a business spends $100,000 buying a large piece of factory equipment or a vehicle, it must capitalize the expense or write it off over time. The IRS has guidelines related to how businesses must capitalize assets, and there are different classes for different types of assets.\n\nA non-operating expense is a cost that is unrelated to the business's core operations.
