These organizations are typically created by legislative action, but may initially be set up by presidential order as well. The directors of these agencies are typically selected by presidential appointment.\n\nFederal agencies are created by the government to regulate industries or practices that require close oversight or specialized expertise. Some organizations, such as theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation(FDIC) and theGovernment National Mortgage Association(GNMA), have their operations explicitly backed by theU.S. Treasury.Other organizations, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae are only provided with an implicit guarantee from the U.S. Treasury.\n\nA number of the organizations which are an actual part of the government issue securities such as stocks and bonds. These have been historically popular with investors.Federal agency bonds, which are bonds that are backed by thefull faith and creditof the United States government, are examples of federal agency securities. Investors expect to receive regular interest payments from holding an agency bond. At maturity, the fullface valueof the agency bond is repaid to the bondholder. Because federal agency bonds are less liquid thanTreasury bonds, they offer a slightly higher rate of interest than Treasury bonds. Examples of federal agencies that guarantee certain bonds or securities include theFederal Housing Administration(FHA),Small Business Administration(SBA), andGovernment National Mortgage Association(GNMA or Ginnie Mae).\n\nAnother type of bond issued by government agencies is thegovernment-sponsored enterprise(GSE) bond. These bonds are issued by corporations that are not quite part of the government but are set up by Congress to work for the common good of the country. These enterprises mostly operate on their own and are publicly held on the major exchanges. GSEs include the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae),Federal Home Loan Mortgage(Freddie Mac), Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, and theFederal Home Loan Bank(FHLB). The government guarantee that applies to agency bonds does not apply to GSE bonds, which therefore havecredit riskanddefault risk.For this reason, the yield on these bonds is typically higher than the yield on Treasury bonds.\n\nMortgage loans are backed by federal agency securities issued by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or the FHLB, and hold a very high credit rating. Agency securities are also used as collateral for the supply of money released by theFederal Reserve.Sold by a nationwide group of banks and dealers, these securities raise money to fund public needs such as road building, low-cost housing, urban renewal, and also to provide low-interest rate loans to farmers, small business owners, and veterans.\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Full Faith and Credit of U.S. Government Behind the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund.\" Accessed Aug. 16, 2021.\n\nGinnie Mae. \"Our History.\" Accessed Aug. 16, 2021.\n\nFreddie Mac. \"GSE Debt Securities,\" Page 1.
