  "definition": "Ricardian equivalence is an economic theory that says that financing government spending out of current taxes or future taxes (and current deficits) will have equivalent effects on the overall economy.This means that attempts to stimulate an economy by increasing debt-financed government spending will not be effective because investors and consumers understand that the debt will eventually have to be paid for in the form of future taxes.\n\nGovernments can finance their spending either by taxing or by borrowing (and presumably taxing later to service the debt). In either case, real resources are withdrawn from the private economy when the government purchases them, but the method of financing is different. Ricardo argued that under certain circumstances, even the financial effects of these can be considered equivalent, because taxpayers understand that even if their current taxes are not raised in the case of deficit spending, their future taxes will go up to pay the government debt. As a result, they will be forced to set aside some current income to save up to pay the future taxes.\n\nBecause these savings necessarily involve forgone current consumption, in a real sense they effectively shift the future tax burden into the present. In either case, the increase in current government spending and consumption of real resources is accompanied by a corresponding decrease in private spending and consumption of real resources. Financing government spending with current taxes or deficits (and future taxes) are thus equivalent in both nominal and real terms.\n\nEconomist Robert Barro formally modeled and generalized Ricardian equivalence, based on the modern economic theory ofrational expectationsand the lifetime income hypothesis.Barro\u2019s version of Ricardian equivalence has been widely interpreted as undermining Keynesian fiscal policy as a tool to boost economic performance. Because investors and consumers adjust their current spending and saving behaviors based on rational expectations of future taxation and their expected lifetime after-tax income, reduced private consumption and investment spending will offset any government sending in excess of current tax revenues. The underlying idea is that no matter how a government chooses to increase spending, whether through borrowing more or taxing more, the outcome is the same and aggregate demand remains unchanged.\n\nThere are several assumptions to the Ricardian equivalence. The top five assumptions include the following:\n\nThe theory states that individuals can borrow and lend freely at the same interest rate as the government. In this idealized scenario, there are no credit constraints, and everyone has equal access to financial markets. This allows consumers to smooth their consumption over time, borrowing when their income is low and saving when it's high.\n\nThe theory suggests that individuals make economic decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of future economic conditions. Consumers are expected to accurately anticipate futuretax changesor increases and adjust their saving behavior accordingly.\n\nThe theory assumes that taxes are levied as lump-sum amounts that do not affect individuals' economic choices. This means that taxes don't influence decisions about work, savings, or consumption. If someone gets a lump sum tax payment, it won't actually influence their spending habits.\n\nThe theory holds that individuals either live forever or care about future generations as much as they care about themselves. This obviously means that the assumption is the current generations fully account for the tax burdens that will be faced by their descendants and make the decisions for these individuals in the future (even at short-term deficits such as paying agift tax).\n\nThe model assumes that individuals have perfect knowledge about their future income streams and tax liabilities. This allows them to make precise calculations about their lifetime resources and adjust their current consumption and saving accordingly.\n\nMany modern economists acknowledge that Ricardian equivalence depends on assumptions that may not always be realistic.\n\nSomeeconomists, including Ricardo himself, have argued that Ricardo's theory is based upon unrealistic assumptions. For instance, the Ricardian equivalence assumes that individuals can borrow and lend freely at the same interest rate as the government. However, capital markets are far from perfect. Many individuals face credit constraints, higher interest rates, or may be unable to borrow at all due to factors such as low income, poor credit history, or lack of collateral. This imperfection means that people can't always smooth their consumption over time as the theory suggests, leading to a breakdown of the equivalence.\n\nThe theory also assumes that people consider the tax burdens of future generations as if they were their own. However, individuals have finite lifespans and may not factor in tax increases that will occur after their death.\u00a0Behavioral economics may suggest that some people exhibit myopic behavior, focusing more on short-term benefits and immediate gratification rather than long-term financial planning.\n\nLast, the Ricardian equivalence doesn't account for potential Keynesian multiplier effects of government spending. In Keynesian economics, government spending can have a stimulative effect on the economy. This means the government can aid in increasing aggregate demand and potentially leading to higher output and employment. These effects could outweigh any increase in private saving, especially in times of economic downturn when there's significant slack in the economy. The presence of these multiplier effects challenges the Ricardian notion that government borrowing is fully offset by private saving.\n\nThe theory of Ricardian equivalence has been largely dismissed by Keynesian economists and ignored by public policy makers who follow their advice. However, there is some evidence that it has validity.\n\nIn a study of the effects of the2008 financial crisison European Union nations, a strong correlation was found between government debt burdens and net financial assets accumulated in 12 of the 15 nations studied. In this case, Ricardian equivalence holds up. Countries with high levels of government debt have comparatively high levels of household savings.\n\nIn addition, a number of studies of spending patterns in the U.S. have found that private sector savings increase by about 30 cents for every additional $1 of government borrowing. This suggests that the Ricardian theory is at least partially correct.\n\nOverall however, the empirical evidence for Ricardian equivalence is somewhat mixed, and likely depends on how well the assumptions that consumers and investors will form rational expectations, base their decisions on their lifetime income, and not face liquidity constraints on their behavior will actually hold in the real world.\n\nRicardian equivalence is an economic theory proposing that the method of financing government spending (whether through taxes or debt) does not affect the overall economy. It suggests that rational consumers will save any extra money from tax cuts to pay for anticipated future tax increases.\n\nThe concept was first introduced by British economist David Ricardo in the early 19th century. However, the modern version of the theory is largely attributed to Harvard economist Robert Barro, who formalized and expanded upon Ricardo's original ideas in a 1974 paper.\n\nIf Ricardian equivalence holds, it implies that fiscal policy (changes in government spending or taxation) would be ineffective in stimulating the economy.\n\nUnder Ricardian equivalence, consumers are assumed to be forward-looking and rational. When the government cuts taxes and increases borrowing, consumers anticipate future tax increases and save the extra income rather than spending it.\u00a0However, behavioral economics suggests this may not always happen because individuals are not always rational.\n\nThe Ricardian equivalence theorem states that government deficit spending is counterbalanced by increased private saving, as individuals anticipate future tax hikes to repay the debt. Consequently, the choice between tax-financed or debt-financed government expenditure becomes economically neutral, as rational consumers adjust their behavior to offset fiscal policy changes.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Modeling and Testing Ricardian Equivalence.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \"Interview With Robert Barro.\"\n\nResearchGate. \"The Effects of the Global Financial Crisis on the Central and Eastern European Union Countries.\"\n\nPressBook. \"Principles of Economics.\"",
