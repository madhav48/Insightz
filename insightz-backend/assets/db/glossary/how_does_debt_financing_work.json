  "term": "How Does Debt Financing Work?",
  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nDebt financing involves companies selling fixed-income products such as bonds, bills, or notes to creditors, including investors.\n\nDebt financing occurs when a firm raises money forworking capitalor capital expenditures by selling debt instruments to individuals and/or institutional investors. The individuals or institutions becomecreditorsin return for lending the money and they receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid.\n\nA company can obtain financing in three ways when it needs money. It can sell equity, take ondebt, or use some hybrid of the two.\n\nEquity represents an ownership stake in the company. It gives the shareholder a claim on future earnings but it doesn't have to be paid back. Equity holders are last in line to receive money if the company goesbankrupt.\n\nThe other way to raise capital in debt markets is to issue shares of stock in a public offering. This is referred to asequity financing.\n\nA company can choose debt financing, which entails sellingfixed-incomeproducts such asbonds, bills, or notesto investors to obtain the capital necessary to grow and expand its operations. When a company issues a bond, the investors that purchase it are effectively lenders who are either retail or institutional investors that provide the company with debt financing.\n\nThe amount of the investment loan is also known as theprincipal. It must be paid back at some agreed date in the future. Lenders have a higher claim on anyliquidated assetsthan shareholders if the company goes bankrupt.\n\nSeveral factors influence and affect debt financing.\n\nA firm's capital structure consists of equity and debt. Thecost of equityis the dividend payments to shareholders, and thecost of debtis the interest payments to bondholders.\n\nA company not only promises to repay the principal amount when it issues debt. It also promises to compensate its bondholders by annually making interest payments known ascoupon paymentsto them. The interest rate paid on these debt instruments represents the cost of borrowing to the issuer.\n\nThe sum of the cost of equity financing and debt financing is a company'scost of capital. It represents the minimum return that a company must earn on its capital to satisfy its shareholders, creditors, and other providers of capital.\n\nA company's investment decisions relating to new projects and operations should always generate returns greater than the cost of capital. The firm isn't generating positive earnings for its investors if its returns on its capital expenditures are below its cost of capital. The company may have to re-evaluate and re-balance its capital structure in this case.\n\nThe formula for the cost of debt financing is:\n\nKD = Interest Expense x (1 - Tax Rate)\n\nThe interest on the debt istax-deductiblein most cases, so the interest expense is calculated on an after-tax basis to make it more comparable to the cost of equity, as earnings on stocks are taxed.\n\nOne metric used to measure and compare how much of a company's capital is being financed with debt financing is thedebt-to-equity ratio(D/E).\n\nThe D/E ratio is $2 billion / $10 billion = 1/5 or 20% if total debt is $2 billion and total stockholders' equity is $10 billion. There's $5 of equity for every $1 of debt financing. A low D/E ratio is generally preferable to a high one, although certain industries have a higher tolerance for debt than others. Both debt and equity can be found on thebalance sheetstatement.\n\nCreditors tend to look favorably on a low D/E ratio, which can increase the likelihood that a company can obtain funding in the future.\n\nCommon types of debt financing include more than just issuing a bond. Some options may be harder for small businesses to secure especially if they haven't been in operations for long or if their financial position isn't as strong as those of larger companies.\n\nSome investors in debt are only interested in principal protection while others want a return in the form of interest. The interest rate is determined by market rates and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Higher rates of interest imply a greater chance ofdefaultand therefore carry a higher level of risk. They help to compensate the borrower for this increased risk.\n\nDebt financing often requires that the borrower adhere to certain rules regarding financial performance. These rules are referred to as covenants.\n\nDebt financing can be difficult to obtain but it provides funding at lower rates than equity financing for many companies, particularly in periods of historically low interest rates. Another advantage is that the interest on the debt istax-deductible. Adding too much debt can increase the cost of capital, however, and this reduces thepresent valueof the company.\n\nThe main difference between debt and equity financing is that equity financing provides extra working capital with no repayment obligation. Debt financing must be repaid, but the company doesn't have to give up a portion of ownership to receive funds.\n\nMost companies use a combination of debt andequity financing. They choose debt or equity financing or both, depending on which type of funding is most easily accessible, the state of theircash flow, and the importance of maintaining ownership control. The D/E ratio shows how much financing is obtained through debt versus equity. Creditors tend to look favorably on a relatively low D/E ratio, which benefits the company if it has to access additional debt financing in the future.\n\nDebt financing comes with some notable pros and cons just like any other type of financing.\n\nOne advantage of debt financing is that it allows a business toleveragea small amount of money into a much larger sum, enabling more rapid growth than might otherwise be possible. Another advantage is that the payments on the debt can be tax-deductible.\n\nDebt financing also allows businesses to retain ownership and control, unlike equity financing where ownership stakes are sold to investors. The business owners don't have to give up any control or decision-making power in the company.\n\nDebt financing can be more cost-effective compared to equity financing and the relationship with the lender ends and there are no further obligations when the debt is repaid. Equity investors typically expect ongoing dividends and a share of the profits which can be more expensive in the long run. The only way to extinguish this is through share reacquisition.\n\nThe main disadvantage of debt financing is that interest must be paid to lenders, so the amount paid will exceed the amount borrowed. Payments on debt must be made regardless of business revenue, and this can be particularly risky for smaller or newer businesses that have yet to establish a secure cash flow.\n\nHigh levels of debt can negatively impact a company\u2019s balance sheet and its financial ratios. This can make the business appear riskier to investors and lenders and potentially lead to higher borrowing costs in the future. High debt levels can also limit a company\u2019s flexibility because much of its revenue will be tied up in servicing debt.\n\nDebt financing also often involves restrictive covenants. Lenders may impose conditions that restrict additional borrowing, dictate certain financial ratios that must be maintained, or limit the types of investments or expenditures a company can undertake. This is arisk managementstrategy to ensure that the lender has security in how the company is being run.\n\nDebt financing allows a business to leverage a small amount of capital to create growth\n\nDebt payments are generally tax-deductible\n\nA company retains all ownership control\n\nDebt financing is often less costly than equity financing\n\nInterest must be paid to lenders\n\nPayments on debt must be made regardless of business revenue\n\nDebt financing can be risky for businesses with inconsistent cash flow\n\nDebt financingincludes bank loans, loans from family and friends, government-backed\u00a0loans such as SBA\u00a0loans, lines of credit, credit cards, mortgages, and equipment\u00a0loans.\n\nDebt financing can be in the form of installment loans, revolving loans, and cash flow loans. Installment loans have set repayment terms and monthly payments. The loan amount is received as a lump sum payment upfront. These loans can be secured or unsecured.\n\nRevolving loans provide access to an ongoing line of credit that a borrower can use, repay, and repeat. Credit cards are an example of revolving loans.\n\nCash flow loansprovide a lump-sum payment from the lender. Payments on the loan are made as the borrower earns the revenue used to secure the loan. Merchant cash advances\u00a0and invoice financing are examples of cash flow loans.\n\nSome companies may prefer to keep the equity ownership intact and not dilute stakes in the company by issuing more shares. It may also be more cost-effective to raise capital with debt compared to issuing stock and having to potentially pay dividends in the future.\n\nDebt financing can be both good and bad. It's a good option if a company can usedebt to stimulate growth, but the company must be sure that it can meet its obligations regarding payments to creditors. A company should use the cost of capital to decide what type of financing it should choose.\n\nMost companies need some form of debt financing. Additional funds allow them to invest in the resources they need to grow. Small and new businesses especially need access to capital to buy equipment, machinery, supplies, inventory, and real estate.\n\nThe main concern with debt financing is that the borrower must be sure they have sufficient cash flow to pay the principal and interest obligations tied to the loan.\n\nSBG Funding. \"Cost of Debt Explained: Formula, Factors, and Examples.\"",
