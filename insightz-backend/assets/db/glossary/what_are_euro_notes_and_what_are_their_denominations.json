  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nThe euro is the official currency of theEuropean Union (EU), adopted by 19 of its 27 member nations.It is the world's second most popular reserve currency after theU.S. dollar, and thesecond most traded.\n\nLaunched in 1999 as part of the EU's integration as theEuropean Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), the euro was strictly an electronic currency until the introduction of paper notes and coins denominated in euros in 2002. The euro is sometimes abbreviated as \"EUR.\"\n\nThe euro is the solelegal tenderin the EU member states that have adopted it, including Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. These countries form theeurozone, a region where the euro serves as the common currency. Four small non-EU nations (Andorra, Vatican City, San Marino, and Monaco) also use the euro as their official currency and several countries havecurrencies peggedto the euro.\n\nTheEuropean Central Bank(ECB) has an EU mandate to maintain price stability by preserving the value of the euro.The ECB is part of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) along with the national central banks of all the EU member states, including those that have not adopted the euro.\n\nAdopting the euro eliminated foreign exchange risk for European businesses andfinancial institutionswith cross-border operations in the increasingly integrated EU economy. The fiscal and monetary prerequisites for adopting the euro have also encouraged deeper political integration of member states.\n\nOn the other hand, the eurozone brought together economies with disparate characteristics and national budgets without the authority for the sort of cross-borderfiscal transfersthat take place between the U.S. federal government and U.S. states.\n\nThat has forced the EU to introduce measures like ECB guarantees for the debt issued by member states in response to market turmoil caused by theEuropean sovereign debt crisis.National governments and central banks remain constrained in responding to economic conditions in their country by their reliance on the ECB's monetary policy and budget rules set by the EU.\n\nFor example, the central bank of a country experiencing an economic slowdown can no longer cut interest rates, devaluing a national currency against that of its major European trading partners to stimulate exports.\n\nWhile the euro can't be devalued to facilitate economic adjustments within the EU, that's also made the common currency a more reliable store of value. The euro remains overwhelmingly popular among the residents of the countries that have adopted it.\n\nEuropean Union. \"Official EU Currency.\"\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"Triennial Central Banking Survey - Foreign Exchange Turnover in April 2019.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Currency Composition of Official Foreign Exchange Reserves.\"\n\nEuropean Central Bank. \"Primary Objective.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"A Comprehensive EU Response to the Financial Crisis: Substantial Progress Towards a Strong Financial Framework for Europe and a Banking Union for the Eurozone.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"Flash Eurobarometer 501 Summary,\" pp. 9-12.",
