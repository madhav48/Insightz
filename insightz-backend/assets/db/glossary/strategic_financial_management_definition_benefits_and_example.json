If a company considers strategic considerations instead of tactical ones, it makes financial decisions based on long-term objectives rather than short-term metrics. To realize those results, a firm sometimes must tolerate losses in the present.\n\nPart of effective strategic financial management may involve sacrificing or readjusting short-term goals to attain the company's long-term objectives more efficiently. For example, a company that suffers a net loss may reduce its asset base by closing facilities or reducing staff and decreasing its operating expenses.
