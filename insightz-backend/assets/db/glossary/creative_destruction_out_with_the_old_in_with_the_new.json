  "term": "Creative Destruction: Out With the Old, in With the New",
  "definition": "Creative destruction is the dismantling of long-standing practices in order to make way for innovation and is seen as a driving force ofcapitalism.\n\nThe term creative destruction was first coined by Austrian economistJoseph Schumpeterin 1942. Schumpeter characterized creative destruction as innovations in the manufacturing process that increaseproductivity, describing it as the \"process of industrial mutation that incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.\"\n\nBasically, the theory of creative destruction assumes that long-standing arrangements and assumptions must be destroyed to free up resources and energy to be deployed for innovation. To Schumpeter, economic development is the natural result of forces internal to the market and is created by the opportunity to seekprofit.\n\nCreative destruction theory treatseconomicsas an organic and dynamic process. This stands in stark contrast with the static mathematical models of traditional Cambridge-tradition economics.Equilibriumis no longer the end goal of market processes. Instead, many fluctuating dynamics are constantly reshaped or replaced by innovation and competition.\n\nAs is implied by the word destruction, the process inevitably results in losers and winners. Producers and workers committed to the older technology will be left stranded.Entrepreneursand workers in new technologies, meanwhile, will inevitably createdisequilibriumand highlight new profit opportunities.\n\nIn describing creative destruction, Schumpeter was not necessarily endorsing it. In fact, his work is considered to be heavily influenced byThe Communist Manifesto, the pamphlet byKarl Marxand Friedrich Engels which decried the bourgeoisie for its \"constant revolutionizing of production [and] uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions.\"\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nNetflix is a modern example of creative destruction, having overthrown disc rental and traditional media industries.\n\nCreative destruction can be seen across many different industries. As all companies often strive to be better, many businesses seek new ways to disrupt the status quo and seek new paths to better business opportunity. Some examples of those industries are below.\n\nCompanies don't technically need to embark on creative destruction; however, by not doing so, they risk the occurrence of falling behind their competition.\n\nThough creative destruction can lead to many long-term positive aspects of economic growth and innovation, it does come with downsides. As old industries and technologies are replaced, jobs may be lost. This can lead to unemployment and hardship for those who are displaced due to the nature of their previous employment relating to an antiquated industry. It can also take time for new jobs and industries to emerge.\n\nThe benefits of creative destruction may also not be evenly distributed. Wealth and power may become concentrated in the hands of a few individuals or companies that are able to succeed in the new markets. This is often the case for those who have the best access to power, capital, or influence. Those who have already succeeded are also the most likely to have the best opportunity to embark on creative destruction.\n\nThe process of creative destruction may also have negative environmental consequences. New technologies and products may have unforeseen environmental impacts that are not immediately apparent, and the process of replacing old technologies with new ones may also have an environmental cost. It may sometimes take years for enough evidence has been collected to truly see the long-term implications of certain forms of innovation.\n\nExamples of creative destruction in history include Henry Ford'sassembly lineand how it revolutionized the automobile manufacturing industry. However, it also displaced older markets and forced many laborers out of work.\n\nThe internet is perhaps the most all-encompassing example of creative destruction, where the losers were not only retail clerks and their employers but also bank tellers, secretaries, and travel agents. The mobile internet added many more losers, from taxi cab drivers to mapmakers.\n\nThe winners, beyond the obvious example of programmers, might be just as numerous. The entertainment industry was turned upside down by the internet, but its need for creative talent and product remains the same or greater. The internet destroyed many small businesses but created many new ones online.\n\nThe point, as Schumpeter noted, is that an evolutionary process rewards improvements and innovations and punishes less efficient ways of organizing resources. Thetrend lineis toward progress, growth, and higherstandards of livingoverall.\n\nWhile creative destruction can cause short-term pain and job losses, it is generally seen as a positive force for long-term economic growth and progress. Creative destruction is driven by innovation, which is a key driver of economic growth. \u00a0Creative destruction also encourages competition, which helps to keep prices low and quality high.\u00a0Last, it may help the economy become more resilient by breaking up monopolies and reducing reliance on outdated industries or technologies.\n\nCreative destruction can give rise to entirely new industries that did not exist before. For example, the rise of the internet has created new industries, such as e-commerce, social media, and digital marketing. This also means that existing products and services are replaced by new innovations which can lead to brand new business models. Last, each of these items mentioned above can result in new jobs or employment sectors.\n\nCreative destruction can occur within almost any industry, leading to the destruction of existing companies and the emergence of new ones.\u00a0It can further happen at a lower level such as individual products and services, leading to the replacement of existing products and services with new ones.\u00a0By extension, this all has an impact on jobs and employment. Simply put, all industries, markets, and sectors are subject to innovation and can be the subject matter to creative destruction.\n\nConsider Apple's frequent product releases. When the company deems it necessary, they release new gadgets, hardware, or software that usually takes the place of prior offerings. This is an example of Apple embarking on creative destruction where they make their older items obsolete in favor of coming up with innovative, new solutions for long-term benefit.\n\nCreative destruction is a concept introduced by economist Joseph Schumpeter that refers to the process of innovation and technological change that leads to the destruction of existing economic structures, such as industries, firms, and jobs. This destruction paves the way for new structures to emerge, thereby creating long-term economic growth and progress. Though potential short-term downsides, creative destruction has the intention of creating long-term value.\n\nKarl Marx. \"Manifesto of the Communist Party,\" Page 16. Sept. 24, 2020.",
