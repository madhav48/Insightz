  "term": "What Is Green Tech? How It Works, Types, Adoption, and Examples",
  "definition": "Green tech, or green technology, generally refers to environmentally friendly technologies designed to reduce negative impacts on the planet through sustainable practices and innovation.\n\nGreen tech refers to\u00a0a type of technology that is considered environmentally friendly based on its production process or itssupply chain. Green tech\u2014an abbreviation of \"green technology\"\u2014can also refer toclean energy production, the use of alternative fuels, and technologies that are less harmful to the environment than fossil fuels.\n\nAlthough the market for green technology is relatively young, it has garnered a significant amount of investor interest due to increasing awareness about the impacts of climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n\nGreen technology is an umbrella term that describes the use of technology and science to create products and services that are environmentally friendly.\u00a0Green tech is related tocleantech, which specifically refers to products or services that improve operational performance while also reducing costs, energy consumption,waste,\u00a0or negative effects on the environment.\n\nThe goal of green tech is to protect the environment, repair damage done to the environment in the past, and conserve the Earth's natural resources. Green tech has also become a burgeoning industry that has attracted enormous amounts of investment capital.\n\nThe use of green tech can be a stated goal of a business segment or a company. These goals are typically outlined in a company'senvironmental, sustainability, and governance (ESG)statement, or can even be found in themission statementof a firm. Increasingly, socially responsible investors are looking to narrow down their prospective investments to only include companies that specifically employ or produce green technologies.\n\nThe $1.2 trillionInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signed into law byPresident Joe Bidenon Nov. 15, 2021,\u00a0earmarked substantial allocations for green tech. These include the largest investment in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure in history, electrifying thousands of school and transit buses across the country, and creating a new authority to build a resilient, clean, electric grid. However, President Trump froze funding for the Jobs Act's clean energy projects shortly after his re-election.\n\nWhile green tech has become increasingly popular in the modern age, elements of these business practices have been in use since the Industrial Revolution. Beginning in the early 19th century, scientists began to observe the ecological impacts of coal-burning industrial plants, and manufacturers have sought to reduce their negative environmentalexternalitiesby altering production processes to produce less soot or waste byproducts.\n\nIn the United States, one of the most important milestones was World War II. In order to reduce consumption and waste, more than 400,000 volunteers began collecting metal, paper, rubber, and other materials for the war effort.\n\nFollowing the war, scientists like Rachel Carson began warning of the consequences of chemical pesticides, while doctors abroad reported mysterious illnesses associated with nuclear radiation.Many point to this era as the genesis of the ecological movement, which sought to preserve ecosystems and resources while raising awareness of the consequences of runaway technology.\n\nGovernment bodies slowly recognized the importance of protecting environmental resources. Curbside recycling programs became common over the following decades, raising awareness about household waste. The Environmental Protection Agency, established in 1970, set firm requirements on pollution and waste and established mandates for coal scrubbers and other clean technologies.\n\nIn the United States, the first major recycling program was launched during World War II. Nearly half a million volunteers pitched in, recycling tens of thousands of tons of waste to help the war effort.\n\nGreen technology is a broad category that encompasses several forms of environmental remediation. While climate change and carbon emissions are now considered among the most pressing global issues, there are also many efforts to address local environmental hazards. Some seek to protect specific ecosystems or endangered species. Others seek to conserve scarce natural resources by finding more sustainable alternatives.\n\nIn order to provide a viable alternative to fossil fuels, many businesses are seeking to engineer alternative sources of energy that do not generate atmospheric carbon. Solar and wind power are now among the mostinexpensive sources of energy, and solar panels are affordable to U.S. homeowners at a consumer scale.Other alternatives, such as geothermal and tidal energy, have yet to be deployed at scale.\n\nNearly a third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions are released by transportation activities, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.Many manufacturers are exploring ways toreduce automotive emissions, either by designing more fuel-efficient engines or shifting to electrical power.\n\nHowever, electric vehicles require a host of innovations in other spheres, such as high-capacity rechargeable batteries and charging infrastructure. In addition, the benefits of electric vehicles are limited by the fact that many power grids still rely on fossil fuels.\n\nFarming and livestock have a substantial environmental footprint, from the high costs of land and water usage to the ecological consequences of pesticides, fertilizers, and animal waste. As a result, there are many opportunities for green technology in the area of agriculture. For example, organic farming techniques can reduce the damage due to soil exhaustion, innovations in cattle feed can reduce methane emissions, and meat substitutes can reduce the consumption of livestock.\n\nRecycling seeks to conserve scarce resources by reusing materials or finding sustainable substitutes. While plastic, glass, paper, and metal waste are the most familiar forms of recycling, more sophisticated operations can be used to recover expensive raw materials from e-waste or automobile parts.\n\nCarbon capture refers to a group of experimental technologies that seek to remove and sequester greenhouse gases, either at the point of combustion or from the atmosphere. This technology has been heavily promoted by the fossil fuel industry, although it has yet to deliver on those expectations.The largest carbon capture facility can absorb 4,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year, a minuscule amount compared to annual emissions.\n\nThe amount of new energy capacity that comes from wind and solar power.\n\nWhile green tech is a broad and hard-to-define category, some types of green technology have experienced wide adoption. Several countries have launched initiatives to eliminate single-use plastics, a goal that would require sizeable investments in alternatives, such as paper substitutes, bioplastics, or recycling technologies. Singapore, for example, has pledged to reach 70% recycling by 2030.\n\nRenewable energy is another frontier for green tech adoption, with fossil fuels recognized as a significant driver for climate change. According to the Energy Information Administration, solar and wind power together will account for 71% of the new energy capacity added in 2024.Worldwide, global investment in all renewable energy sources exceeded $3 trillion in 2024.\n\nWhile green technologies have the shared goal of preserving biodiversity and conserving the earth's resources, there are few ways to do so without affecting the environment in other ways. In some cases, reducing environmental costs in one area means causing adverse impacts in another.\n\nFor example, the batteries in electric vehicles rely on lithium, an element that is often strip-mined from South American rain forests.Hydroelectric dams have low carbon emissions, but high impacts on the salmon and other species that rely on those waterways.Green energy devicessuch as solar panels and wind turbines require a host of rare minerals, that can only be extracted with the use of toxic chemicals.\n\nThis does not necessarily mean that green technology is a lost cause, but it does require careful accounting to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nThere are several obstacles to adopting green technology, including the high initial costs. Developing and implementing sustainable technologies often requires significant investments that deter many businesses and consumers. Additionally, the lack of financial incentives and subsidies can make it challenging for smaller entities to bear the upfront expenses, slowing down the overall pace of green tech adoption.\n\nAnother major hurdle is the insufficient infrastructure to support new green technologies. Many regions lack the necessary facilities. This inadequate support network hampers the efficient use of green tech, making it less attractive to potential adopters. Additionally, existing policies and regulations often lag behind technological advances, further complicating widespread implementation.\n\nSupply chain challenges have also been an obstacle, including a shortage of transformers that are needed to connect clean energy to the grid.\n\nGreen technology is undoubtedly a growth industry driven by increasing global awareness and the urgent need for sustainable solutions. As governments and organizations prioritize environmental policies, investments in clean energy, electric vehicles, and sustainable agriculture are booming. This surge in funding and innovation highlights the sector's potential for rapid expansion and possibly long-term profitability.\n\nSolar power was the fastest-growing power source in the U.S. in 2025. A record\u00a037 gigawatts (GW)\u00a0of solar energy capacity was installed in the U.S. in 2024, almost double the figure from 2023.\n\nMoreover, consumer demand for eco-friendly products and services is high, propelling the green tech market forward. In a 2020 McKinsey survey, more than 60% of respondents said they\u2019d pay more for a product with sustainable packaging.Another study by McKinsey and NielsenIQ found that products making ESG-related claims saw more sales growth from 2017 to 2022, averaging 28% cumulative growth, compared to 20% growth for products that made no ESG-related claims.\n\nCompanies that adopt and develop green technologies can potentially gain competitive advantages, attracting both customers and investors. This growing interest not only boosts industry revenue but also encourages further advancements, establishing green tech as a cornerstone of future economic growth.\n\nThe cheapest form of alternative energy is solar power, according to the International Energy Agency. In its 2020 World Outlook Report, the Agency found that photovoltaic solar energy is \"consistently cheaper than new coal- or gas-fired power plants in most countries, and solar projects now offer some of the lowest-cost electricity ever seen.\"\n\nThe easiest way toinvest in green techis to buy stock in companies that are making major bets on environmentally-friendly technologies. Investors can attempt to identify individual stocks, or simply invest in a mutual fund, index fund, or another instrument that seeks to reflect the broader market for environmental investments. The advantage to the latter approach is that the investor will gain diversified exposure to the green tech industry, rather than the fortunes of a single company.\n\nNuclear power is a deeply controversial subject, and many scientists have disputed its benefits. Although nuclear power derived from fission can provide reliable, inexpensive electricity without greenhouse gases, it also produces highly radioactive waste that must be stored for thousands of years. Some activists have argued that nuclear power can never be safely generated, and a number of high-profile accidents\u2014notably at Chernobyl and Fukushima\u2014have highlighted these concerns. However, it should also be noted that the combined death toll from nuclear accidents is far lower than the annual fatalities from fossil fuel pollution.\n\nThe main purpose of green tech is to promote sustainability and minimize environmental degradation through innovative technical solutions.\n\nNorway\u2014along with its Nordic counterparts, such as Sweden and Denmark\u2014is recognized globally for pioneering green tech, renewable energy, and sustainable resource management.\n\nGreen tech is a growing industry that has drawn significant interest and investments in recent years, driven by increasing concern over climate change and the depletion of natural resources around the world. Green tech involves the creation and use of alternative fuels and less-harmful technologies, aiming to protect the environment, repair environmental damage, and conserve the Earth's natural resources.\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Trump Freezes IRA Funding.\"\n\nThe White House. \"UPDATED FACT SHEET: Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs\u00a0Act.\"\n\nNortheast Recycling Council. \"A Brief History of Recycling.\"\n\nOrigins: Current Events in Historical Perspective, Ohio State University. \"A World Drenched with Pesticides: Rachel Carson\u2019s Silent Spring.\"\n\nHasegawa, Arifumi, et ali. \"Health Effects of Radiation and Other Health Problems in the Aftermath of Nuclear Accidents, with an Emphasis on Fukushima.\"The Lancet, vol. 386, no. 9992, August 2015, pp. 479-488.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. \"The Origins of EPA.\"\n\nWorld Economic Forum. \"Explained: Why Renewables Became So Cheap So Fast.\"\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory. \"Documenting a Decade of Cost Declines for PV Systems.\"\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. \"Sources of Greenhouse Gas Emissions.\"\n\nBloomberg Green. \"Chevron's Carbon Capture Struggle Shows Big Oil's Climate Hurdle.\"\n\nThe Guardian. \"World's Biggest Machine Capturing Carbon From Air Turned on in Iceland.\"\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \"Solar and Battery Storage to Make Up 81% of New U.S. Electric-Generating Capacity in 2024.\"\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme. \"Addressing Single Use Plastics Production Pollution Using a Life Cycle Approach,\" Pages 20-21, 36.\n\nInternational Energy Agency. \"World Energy Investment 2024: Overview and Key Findings.\"\n\nMIT Climate Portal. \"How is Lithium Mined?\"\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \"Hydropower Explained.\"\n\nHarvard International Review. \"Not So \u201cGreen\u201d Technology: The Complicated Legacy of Rare Earth Mining.\"\n\nWorld Bank. \"Minerals for Climate Action: The Mineral Intensity of the Clean Energy Transition,\" Page 37.\n\nWorld Resources Institute. \"State of the US Clean Energy Transition: Recent Progress, and What Comes Next.\"\n\nUS News & World Report. \"New Solar Plants to Power Majority of US Energy Generation Growth, IEA Says.\"\n\nMcKinsey & Company. \"Consumers care about sustainability\u2014and back it up with their wallets.\"\n\nInternational Energy Agency. \"World Outlook 2020\u2014Executive Summary,\" Page 18.\n\nOur World in Data. \"What Are the Safest and Cleanest Sources of Energy?\"\n\nTrade.gov. \"Green Technologies.\"",
