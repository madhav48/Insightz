  "term": "What Is New Growth Theory? Definition, How It's Used, and Example",
  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe new growth theory\u00a0is an economic concept, positing that humans' desires and unlimited wants foster ever-increasingproductivityand economic growth. It argues\u00a0thatreal gross domestic product(GDP)per person will perpetually increase because of people's pursuit of profits.\n\nThe new growth theory offered a fresh take on what engineers economic prosperity. It emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship, knowledge, innovation, and technology, challenging the view ofexogenous growthinneoclassical economicsthat economic progress is determined by external, uncontrollable forces.\n\nCompetition squeezes profit, so people have to constantly seek better ways to do things or invent new products in order to maximize profitability. This concept is one of the central tenets of the new growth theory.\n\nThe theory argues that innovation and new technologies do not occur simply by random chance. Rather, it depends on the number of people seeking out new innovations or technologies and how hard they are looking for them. People also have control over theirknowledge capital\u2014what to study, how hard to study, etc. If the profit incentive is great enough, people will choose to growhuman capitaland look harder for new innovations.\n\nA significant aspect of the new growth theory is the idea that knowledge is treated as anassetfor growth that is not subject to finite restrictions or diminishing returns like other assets such ascapitalor real estate. Knowledge is an intangible quality, rather than physical, and can be a resource grown within an organization or industry.\n\nUnder the new growth theory, nurturing innovation internally is one of the reasons for organizations to invest in human capital. By creating opportunities and making resources available within an organization, the expectation is that\u00a0individuals will be encouraged\u00a0to develop new concepts and technology\u00a0for the\u00a0consumer market.\n\nFor example, a large enterprise might allow part of its staff to work on independent, internal projects that may develop into new innovations or companies. In some ways, the enterprise lets them function likestartupsbeing incubated inside the organization.\n\nThe desire of the employees to launch a new innovation is spurred by the possibility of generating more profits for themselves and the enterprise. This can be especially true in the United States, as commerce is increasingly driven by service-type companies. Software and app development may take place within companies, following the new growth theory.\n\nAchieving such knowledge-driven growth requires a sustained investment in human capital. This can create an environment for skilled professionals to have an opportunity to not only fulfill their primary jobs\u00a0but also explore the creation of new services that can be of benefit and use to the broader public.\n\nNew growth theorists believe that companies generally undervalue the usefulness of knowledge and, as a result, argue that it is mainly up to governments to invest in human capital. Governments are encouraged to facilitate access to better education, as well as provide support and incentives for private-sectorresearch and development (R&D).\n\nRomer, Paul M. \"Increasing Returns and Long-Run Growth.\"Rochester Center for Economic Research Working Paper Series 27, October 1985, pp. 1-53.\n\nSala-i-Martin, Xavier. \"15 Years of New Growth Economics: What Have We Learnt?\"Columbia University, Department of Economics, Discussion Paper #:0102-47, April 2002, pp. 14-15.\n\nSala-i-Martin, Xavier. \"15 Years of New Growth Economics: What Have We Learnt?\"Columbia University, Department of Economics, Discussion Paper #:0102-47, April 2002, pp. 15.",
