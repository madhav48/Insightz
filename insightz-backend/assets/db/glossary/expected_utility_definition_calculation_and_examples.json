  "term": "Expected Utility: Definition, Calculation, and Examples",
  "definition": "\"Expected utility\" is an economic term summarizing theutilitythat an entity or aggregate economy is expected to reach under any number of circumstances. The expected utility is calculated by taking theweighted averageof all possible outcomes under certain circumstances. With the weights being assigned by the likelihood or probability, any particular event will occur.\n\nThe expected utility of an entity is derived from the expected utility hypothesis. This hypothesis states that under uncertainty, theweighted averageof all possible levels of utility will best represent the utility at any given point in time.\n\nExpected utility theory is used as a tool for analyzing\u00a0situations in which individuals must make a decision without knowing the outcomes that may result from that decision, i.e., decision making under\u00a0uncertainty. These individuals will choose the action that will result in the highest expected utility, which is the sum of the products of probability and\u00a0utility over all possible outcomes. The decision made will also depend on the agent\u2019srisk aversionand the utility of other agents.\n\nThis theory also notes that the utility of money does not necessarily equate to the\u00a0total value of money. This theory helps explain why people may take out insurance policies to cover themselves for various risks. The expected value from paying for insurance would be to lose out monetarily. The possibility of large-scale losses could lead to a serious decline in utility because of thediminishing marginal utility of wealth.\n\nThe concept of\u00a0expected utility\u00a0was first posited\u00a0byDaniel Bernoulli,\u00a0who used it to solve theSt. Petersburg Paradox.\n\nThe St. Petersburg Paradox\u00a0can be illustrated as a\u00a0game of chance in which\u00a0a\u00a0coin is tossed\u00a0at each game's play. For instance, if the stakes start at $2\u00a0and double\u00a0every time heads appear, once\u00a0the\u00a0first time tails appear the game ends, and the player wins whatever is in the pot.\n\nUnder such game rules, the player wins $2\u00a0if tails appear on the first toss, $4\u00a0if heads appear on the first toss and tails on the second, $8\u00a0if heads appear on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on.\n\nMathematically, the player wins 2kdollars, wherekequals the number of tosses (kmust be a whole number and greater than zero).\u00a0Assuming the game can continue as long as the coin toss results in heads and, in particular, that the casino has unlimited resources, in theory, the sum is limitless. Thus the expected win for repeated play is an infinite amount of money.\n\nBernoulli solved the St. Petersburg Paradox\u00a0by distinguishing between theexpected valueand\u00a0expected utility, as the latter uses weighted\u00a0utility\u00a0multiplied by probabilities instead of using weighted outcomes.\n\nExpected utility is also related to the concept ofmarginal utility. The expected utility of a reward or wealth decreases when a person is rich or has sufficient wealth. In such cases, a person may choose the safer option as opposed to a riskier one.\n\nFor example, consider the case of a lottery ticket with expected winnings of $1 million. Suppose a person with comparatively fewer resources buys the ticket for $1. A wealthy person offers to buy the ticket off them for $500,000. Logically, the lottery holder has a 50-50 chance of profiting from the transaction. It is likely that they will opt for the safer option of selling the ticket and pocketing the $500,000. This is due to the diminishing marginal utility of amounts over $500,000 for the ticket holder. In other words, it is much more profitable for them to get from $0 - $500,000 than from $500,000 - $1 million.\n\nNow consider the same offer made to a very wealthy person, possibly a millionaire. Likely, the millionaire will not sell the ticket because they hope to make another million from it.\n\nA 1999 paper by economist Matthew Rabin argued that the expected utility theory is implausible over modest stakes.This means that the expected utility theory fails when the incremental marginal utility amounts are insignificant.\n\nDecisions involving expected utility are decisions involving uncertain outcomes. An individual calculates the probability of expected outcomes in such events and weighs them against the expected utility before making a decision.\n\nFor example, purchasing a lottery ticket represents two possible outcomes for the buyer. They could end up losing the amount they invested in buying the ticket, or they could end up making a smart profit by winning either a portion of the entire lottery. Assigningprobability valuesto the costs involved (in this case, the nominal purchase price of a lottery ticket), it is not difficult to see that the expected utility to be gained from purchasing a lottery ticket is greater than not buying it.\n\nExpected utility is also used to evaluate situations without immediate payback, such as purchasing insurance. When one weighs the expected utility to be gained from making payments in an insurance product (possible tax breaks and guaranteed income at the end of a predetermined period) versus the expected utility of retaining the investment amount and spending it on other opportunities and products, insurance seems like a better option.\n\nUC Berkeley. \"Risk Aversion and Expected-Utility Theory: A Calibration Theorem.\" Accessed May 7, 2021.",
