  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nGroup life insurance is offered by an employer or another large-scale entity, such as an association or labor organization, to its workers or members. It is fairly inexpensive, may even be free for certain employees, and is pretty common nationwide.\n\nGroup life often has a relatively low coverage amount and is offered as a piece of a larger employer or membership benefit package. Members of a group life policy do not need to submit to a medical examination and are not subject to individual underwriting.\n\nGroup life insurance is a single contract for life insurance coverage that extends to a group of people. By purchasing group life insurance policy coverage through an insurance provider on a wholesale basis for its members, companies are able to secure costs for each individual employee that are much lower than if they were to purchase an individual policy.\n\nThose receiving group life insurance coverage may not have to pay anything out of pocket for policy benefits. People who choose to take more-advanced coverage alongside it may elect to have their portion of the premium payment deducted from their paycheck. Just as with regular insurance policies, insured parties are required to list one or morebeneficiariesbefore the policy comes into effect. Beneficiaries can be changed at any point during the coverage period.\n\nThe typical group policy is forterm life insurance, often renewable each year with a company\u2019s open-enrollment process. This is in contrast towhole life insurance, which provides coverage no matter when you die. Whole life insurance policies are permanent, have higher premiums and death benefits, and constitute the most popular type of life insurance.\n\nWith group life insurance, the employer or organization purchasing the policy for its staff or members retains the master contract. Employees who elect coverage through the group policy usually receive a certificate of coverage, which is needed to provide to a subsequent insurance company in the event that an individual leaves the company or organization and terminates their coverage.\n\nGroup life insurance policies generally come with certain conditions. Some organizations requiregroup membersto participate for a minimum amount of time before they are granted coverage. For instance, an employee may need to pass a probationary period before being allowed to take part in employee health and life insurance benefits.\n\nCoverage is normally only valid for as long as a member is part of the group. Once the member leaves, whether through resignation or firing, the coverage ends.\n\nGroup life insurance policies remain intact until insured parties are terminated or leave the group.\n\nThe biggest appeal group life insurance has for employees is its value for money. Group members typically pay very little, if anything at all. Any premiums are drawn directly from their weekly or monthly gross earnings. Qualifying for group policies is easy, with coverage guaranteed to all group members. Unlike individual policies, group insurance doesn\u2019t require a medical exam.\n\nHowever, low cost and convenience aren\u2019t everything. Group life insurance generally comes with only basic coverage, which meansit may not fulfill the needs of policyholders. Typical amounts are $20,000, $50,000, or one or two times the insured\u2019s annual salary. That\u2019s why experts say it should be treated as a perk and supplemented with a separate individual policy, rather than being seen as sufficient standalone coverage.\n\nAnother drawback is that the employer controls the policy, which means your premiums can increase based on decisions that your employer makes. If an organization opts to terminate group life insurance\u2014or a person decides to switch jobs\u2014coverage usually stops. However, the former employee does have an option to continue coverage at the individual level. This means the policy is converted from a group life policy to an individual one, which comes with higher premiums. While many people may not want the greater cost, those who are otherwise uninsurable will benefit from the conversion, as a medical exam still would not be required.\n\nSome organizations allow group members to purchase more coverage than basic life insurance. That extra voluntary coverage may make financial sense because even the added premium will still be based on the less-expensive group rate. That part of the policy also may beportablebetween jobs. Unlike the basic group policy, additional coverage often requires applicants to answer a medical questionnaire, but it may not require an actual physical exam. That could be a good option for people whose health issues might make it difficult to qualify for an affordable individual policy.\n\nInexpensive to buy (or paid by the employer in some cases)\n\nMay be able to add coverage for dependents\n\nNot portable once you leave the organization\n\nOrganization controls the policy and its terms\n\nWhen searching for a policy to supplement your employer's plan, thoroughly research and compare all of your options to make certain you're getting the best life insurance policy possible.\n\nGroup life insurance is a common employee benefit that provides a death benefit to the insured's beneficiaries if they die while part of the organization. The purpose is to provide financial support to the families of such employees.\n\nOnce you leave the organization, group life insurance terminates (either immediately or after a short grace period). This includes being fired, quitting, changing jobs, or retirement. Certain employees may be able to convert their group coverage into an individual policy upon retirement, but the employer may not continue to pay these premiums.\n\nThe most common type of group life insurance isgroup term insurancethat renews yearly. This type of insurance provides only a death benefit and is the least expensive option.Group universal lifeis more expensive, but offers the opportunity to build cash value alongside the death benefit. Variable group universal life is similar but offers an investment option for increasing the potential returns on the cash value portion.",
