  "definition": "NICHOLAS ROBERTS / Stringer / Getty Images\n\nSystemic risk is the possibility that an event at the company level could trigger severe instability or collapse an entire industry or economy. Systemic risk was a major contributor to thefinancial crisisof 2008. Companies considered to be a systemic risk are called \"too big to fail.\"\n\nThese institutions are large relative to their respective industries or make up a significant part of the overall economy. A company highly interconnected with others is also a source of systemic risk. Systemic risk should not be confused withsystematic risk; systematic risk relates to the entire financial system.\n\nThe federal government uses systemic risk as a justification\u2014an often correct one\u2014to intervene in the economy. The basis for this intervention is the belief that the government can reduce or minimize the ripple effect from a company-level event through targeted regulations and actions.\n\nAlthough some companies are considered \"too big to fail,\" they will if the government does not intervene during turbulent economic times.\n\nHowever, sometimes the government will choose not to intervene simply because the economy at that time had undergone a major rise and the general market needs a breather. This is more often the exception than the rule, since it can destabilize an economy more than projected due to consumer sentiment.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, fully known asDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\u00a0introduced an\u00a0enormous set of new laws that are supposed to prevent another Great Recession from occurring by tightly regulating key financial institutions to limit systemic risk. There has been much debate about whether changes need to be made to the reforms to facilitate the growth of small business.\n\nLehman Brothers\u2019 size and integration into the U.S. economy made it a source of systemic risk. Whenthe firm collapsed, it created problems throughout thefinancial systemand the economy. Capital markets froze up while businesses and consumers could not get loans, or could only get loans if they were extremely creditworthy, posing minimal risk to the lender.\n\nSimultaneously, AIG was also suffering from serious financial problems. Like Lehman, AIG\u2019s interconnectedness with other financial institutions made it a source of systemic risk during the financial crisis. AIG's portfolio of assets tied to subprime mortgages and its participation in theresidential mortgage-backed securities\u00a0(RMBS)market through its securities-lending program led to collateral calls, a loss of liquidity, and a downgrade of AIG's credit rating when the value of those securities dropped.\n\nWhile the U.S. government did not bail out Lehman, it decided to bail out AIG with loans of more than $180 billion, preventing the company from going bankrupt. Analysts and regulators believed that anAIG\u00a0bankruptcywould have caused numerous other financial institutions to collapse as well.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cFinancial Regulation: Systemic Risk,\u201d Pages 1-2.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. \u201cDodd-Frank Act.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cFinancial Regulation: Systemic Risk,\u201d Page 3.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York. \u201cActions Related to AIG.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cFinancial Regulation: Systemic Risk,\u201d Page 9.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \u201cAIG Program Status.\u201d",
