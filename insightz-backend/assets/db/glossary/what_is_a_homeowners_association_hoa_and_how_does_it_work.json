  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA homeowners\u00a0association (HOA) is an organization in a subdivision, planned community, orcondominiumbuilding that makes and enforces rules for the properties and residents. Homeowners associations are run by a board of directors and typically collect monthly or annual fees to pay for common area maintenance and the upkeep of facilities.\n\nThose who purchase property within an HOA\u2019s jurisdiction automatically become members. Some associations can be very restrictive about what members can do with their properties. Others give residents more freedom.\n\nHomeowners\u00a0associations (HOAs) are usually formed within communities or neighborhoods of single-family homes or multiple-unit buildings such as townhomes or condominiums. An HOA is typically established to make and enforce rules regarding thepropertieswithin the jurisdiction.\n\nHOAs are composed of and run by the community\u2019s residents. Membership is usually a requirement to buy a home within a community where an HOA has been established.\n\nAn HOA usually has a board of directors or governors. These groups are elected to enforce and oversee the HOA\u2019s rules and regulations.\u00a0An HOA typically describes its rules asrestrictive covenantsin a document called a Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs).\n\nCC&Rs set certain conditions for owners about the maintenance of their properties.These sometimes include structural restrictions such as the type of fences or landscape allowed. They may also include more minor aesthetic choices like the color of paint on a house.\n\nA CC&R document may also outline the penalties for violating\u00a0the guidelines in the agreement. These penalties can take the shape offeesor forced compliance. They can even be as drastic as litigation in some cases.\n\nSome HOAs can wield significant financial and legal power over the property owners in their zone. HOAs collect monthly or annualHOA feesthat depend on several factors:\n\nThe fees are typically $200 to $400 per month but they can range anywhere from less than $100 to upward of $10,000 in luxury neighborhoods or communities.\n\nHOA fees also often contribute to the association\u2019s reserve fund which is set aside for major renovation projects or emergency use. In addition to regular fees, HOAs can also impose special assessments on homeowners when the association lacks sufficient reserves to pay for unexpected repairs on common areas such as sidewalks or parking lots.\n\nThe HOA\u2019s board is usually responsible for the organization\u2019s finances and it oversees the collection and management of funds. Along with setting dues and assessments, the board can slap fines on homeowners who break the rules or damage the common areas. HOAs\u00a0can also place alienon a property if a homeowner falls seriously behind on their dues.\n\nExisting HOA liens can make it difficult to sell the home unless they're cleared.\n\nMost HOAs areincorporatedso they're subject to state laws. Some states consider condominium-based HOAs (often called condominium communities) and organizations governing cooperatives (called co-op boards) to be distinct entities from HOAs, however.\n\nThis distinction is made on the assumption that the property interests of these organizations differ. The designation community association serves as a\u00a0broader, umbrella term as a result. It encompasses HOAs, condominium communities, and co-op boards.\n\nAn HOA is distinct from a property owners\u2019 association, which usually refers to a group of people who want to better their community and the real estate values of the property there. The main difference between them and HOAs is that property owners\u2019 associations can include anyone in the community with an interest in the value of the community\u2019s real estate, including individuals who aren\u2019t homeowners.\n\nThe number of HOAs in the United States as of 2023, according to the Foundation for Community Association Research.That number is expected to increase by 3,000 in 2024. About 75.5 million Americans reside in a community association neighborhood or property.\n\nThe HOA provides regulations and guidelines for its members. These standards are upheld to preserve and enhance the community\u2019sproperty values.\n\nThe guidelines are often appearance-oriented so they deal with regulations for the cleanliness of the property, the condition of the property, and any repairs that are done to the property. The guidelines for HOAs are usually designed to help ensure a uniform appearance for all the properties included in the association\u2019s zone.\n\nThe HOA management will typically provide additional services for its members in exchange for their HOA fees. These amenities are available to all HOA members and may include:\n\nSome HOA fees may also cover the cost of trash collection and certainutilities.\n\nHOAs are symbolic of self-governance and democracy for certain individuals. This belief may stem from the idea that the best people to manage a community are those who live in it rather than a landlord who doesn\u2019t reside on the premises.\n\nOne disadvantage of an HOA is the high cost of the association fees. This can act as a deterrent for some prospective buyers. The HOA rules and regulations can also seem unreasonable, arbitrary, or too restrictive for some homeowners who may want the freedom to customize their properties.\n\nHOA board members are normally volunteers and they may not be properly trained to managereal estate, deal with complex financial issues, or unite a disparate group of people for a common cause. The leadership of HOAs must reach a consensus when they're making decisions about maintenance and upgrades so it's also possible that there may be conflicts among HOA members who disagree.\n\nSet and enforce community rules\n\nProvide services, amenities, and facilities\n\nImpose fees, dues, and assessments\n\nMaintain restrictive regulations\n\nMay be run amateurishly or ineptly\n\nIndividual homeowners may conflict with their HOAs. One thorny issue in particular relates to the installation of solar panels. HOA boards often don\u2019t like them, fearing that they hurt property values. They\u2019re allowed to forbid homeowners from adding them to their residences in 23 states.\n\nAn electrical engineer residing in Blaine, Minnesota applied for permission to addsolar panelsto their house in 2020. The HOA rejected their proposal in October of that year, citing aesthetic concerns because the panels were too visible from the street. The HOA also cited the lack of established guidelines for rooftop solar in the association\u2019s bylaws.\n\nThe electrical engineer joined a group of homeowners and solar advocates asking Minnesota lawmakers to support a bill that would allow homeowners associations to regulate but not ban the installation of solar thermal panels on single-family homes. Introduced in the Minnesota House of Representatives in early 2021, it was one of a series of similar bills proposed that never passed.\n\nA homeowners association (HOA) is an organization tasked with governing the affairs of a real estate development owned by multiple parties such as an apartment building. HOAs are responsible for tasks such as ensuring building maintenance, deciding on whether to pursue larger renovation projects, and drafting and enforcing the building\u2019s bylaws.\n\nHOAs charge their members monthly fees to fund their operations, typically in the range of $200 to $400 per month. They also have the authority to enforce the community\u2019s bylaws such as by imposing fines on residents who refuse to comply.\n\nHOAs can benefit individual owners by providing necessary management services. Without an HOA, the owners of an apartment building would have to coordinate among themselves to decide on common problems such as building-wide garbage removal, building repairs, and community policies. This could be very time-consuming for residents and could result in conflicts and disagreements between owners.\n\nHOAs can also create problems for owners, however, to the extent that an owner disagrees with the HOA\u2019s community bylaws or spending decisions.\n\nIndividual HOAs have varying levels of legal powers depending on how they were designed. They generally have the legal authority to create and enforce community policies, however, such as whether to allow smoking, pets, or rentals in the building.\n\nHOAs also decide on budgets for the building and have the authority to charge monthly or one-time fees to their members. HOAs can impose a range of penalties if a member refuses to pay these fees or to comply with community policies. These penalties can include monetary fines, the restriction of community privileges, and even litigation in many cases.\n\nOwning a home comes with many rights and responsibilities but you may also be part of a homeowners association (HOA) if you own a townhome or condo or are part of a specific community.\n\nBeing part of these communities can be beneficial because they often take care of some of the nitty-gritty duties of homeownership such as property maintenance, utilities, landscaping, and snow removal. But these organizations can be restrictive by setting boundaries on what you can and can\u2019t do with your own property, all for a fee.\n\nFoundation for Community Association Research. \u201cThe Community Association Fact Book 2020.\u201d Page 14 (Page 16 of PDF)\n\nFoundation for Community Association Research. \u201cStatistical Review: Summary of Key Association Data and Information.\u201d\n\nNational Association of REALTORS. \"Study: Homeowners Associations Are Booming.\"\n\nEnergy News Network. \u201cHomeowners Associations Still a Barrier for Some Would-Be Solar Customers.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Legislature, Office of the Revisor of Statutes. \u201cHF 257.\u201d",
