  "definition": "Getty Images, Chris Hondros / Staff\n\nAn alternative trading system (ATS) is a trading venue that is more loosely regulated than anexchange. ATS platforms are often used to match large buy and sell orders among their subscribers. The most widely used type of ATS in the United States is anelectronic communication network(ECN)\u2014a computerized system that automatically matches buy and sell orders for securities in the market.\n\nATSs\u00a0account for much of the\u00a0liquidity\u00a0found in publicly traded issues worldwide. They are known asmultilateral trading facilitiesin Europe,\u00a0ECNs, cross networks, and call networks.Most ATSs are registered as broker-dealers rather than exchanges and focus on finding\u00a0counterparties\u00a0for transactions.\n\nUnlike some national exchanges, ATSs do not set rules governing the conduct of subscribers or discipline subscribers, other than by excluding them from trading. They are important in providing alternative means to accessliquidity.\n\nInstitutional investorsmay use an ATS to find counterparties for transactions, instead of trading large blocks of shares on national stock exchanges. These actions may be designed to conceal trading from public view since ATS transactions do not appear on national exchange order books. The benefit of using an ATS to execute such orders is that it reduces the domino effect that large trades might have on the price of an equity.\n\n\"Alternative trading system (ATS)\" is the terminology used in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe, they are known as \"multilateral trading facilities.\"\n\nThese trading venues must be approved by the SEC. Regulators have stepped up enforcement actions against ATSs for infractions such as trading against customer order flow or making use of confidential customer trading information. These violations may be more common in ATSs than in national exchanges because ATSs face fewer regulations.\n\nA hedge fund interested in building a large position in a company may use an ATS to prevent other investors from buying in advance. ATSs used for these purposes may be referred to asdark pools.\n\nDark pools entail trading on an ATS by\u00a0institutional\u00a0orders executed on private exchanges. Information about these transactions is mostly unavailable to the public, which is why they are called \"dark.\" The bulk of dark pool\u00a0liquidity\u00a0is created byblock tradesfacilitated away from the central stock market exchanges and conducted by institutional investors (primarily investment banks).\n\nAlthough they are legal, dark pools operate with little transparency. As a result, dark pools, along withhigh-frequency trading(HFT), are oft-criticized by those in the finance industry; some traders believe that these elements convey an unfair advantage to certain players in the stock market.\n\nSEC Regulation ATSestablished a regulatory framework for ATSs. An ATS meets the definition of an exchange under federal securities laws but is not required to register as a national securities exchange if the ATS operates under the exemption provided under Exchange Act Rule 3a1-1(a). To operate under this exemption, an ATS must comply with the requirements\u00a0in Rules 300-303 of Regulation ATS.\n\nTo comply with Regulation ATS, an ATS must register as abroker-dealerand file an initial operation report with the Commission on Form ATS before beginning operations. An ATS must file amendments to Form ATS to provide notice of any changes to its operations and must file a cessation of operation report on Form ATS if it closes. The requirements for filing reports using Form ATS are in Rule 301(b)(2) of Regulation ATS. These requirements include mandated reporting of books and records.\n\nThere have been moves to make ATS more transparent. For example, the SEC amended Regulation ATS to enhance \"operational transparency\" for such systems in 2018. Among other things, this entails filing detailed public disclosures to inform the general public about potentialconflicts of interestand risks of information leakage. ATSs are also required to have written safeguards and procedures to protect subscribers' trading information.\n\nThe SEC formally defines an alternative trading system as \"any organization, association, person, group of persons, or systems (1) that constitutes, maintains, or provides a marketplace or facilities for bringing together purchasers and sellers of securities or for otherwise performing with respect to securities the functions commonly performed by a stock exchange within the meaning of Rule 3b-16 under the Exchange Act; and (2) that does not (i) set rules governing the conduct of subscribers other than the conduct of such subscribers' trading on such organization, association, person, group of persons, or system, or (ii) discipline subscribers other than by exclusion from trading.\"\n\nOver-the-counter (OTC) securities are securities that are not listed on an exchange. They trade between parties directly. Most of these trades are completed on alternative trading systems (ATS). ATSs show quotes from broker-dealers for OTC securities. There are two such interdealer quotation systems: Global OTC ATS and OTC Link ATS.\n\nA stock exchange is a heavily regulated marketplace that brings together buyers and sellers to trade listed securities. An ATS is an electronic venue that also brings buyers and sellers together; however, it does not have any regulatory responsibilities (though it is regulated by the SEC) and trades both listed and unlisted securities.\n\nAlternative trading systems make money by charging fees and commissions for transactions. The more trades a trader makes, the more cost to them and more sales revenue for the ATS.\n\nAlternative trading systems (ATSs) facilitate large buy and sell orders between parties, usually institutional investors, which helps keep such trades private and limits the impact that such large orders would have on the price of a security in the open, public markets.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Shedding Light on Dark Pools.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Responses to Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Rule 301(b)(5) under Regulation ATS 'Fair Access Rule'.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Regulation of NMS Stock Alternative Trading Systems.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"SEC Adopts Rules to Enhance Transparency and Oversight of Alternative Trading Systems.\"",
