He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe National Retail Federation (NRF) is a retail trade association, founded in 1911, that is made up of members from all phases of the retail industry, including department stores, specialty, discount, catalog, Internet and independent retailers, restaurant chains, and grocers, as well as businesses that supply goods and services to retailers. The NRF, formerly called the National Retail Dry Goods Association in 2011, forms an umbrella over many state, national and international retail associations.\n\nThe National Retail Federation states\u00a0that it is the largest association of retailers in the world. It represents a wide variety of retail segments in the United States and over 45 countries. It also holds a large annual convention dubbed \u201cThe Big Show,\u201d held in New York City over multiple days.\n\nBased in Washington, D.C., the NRF offers memberships to retailers, industry partners, universities and students, and distributes retail-focused publications such as newsletters and STORES magazine.\n\nThe NRF has several divisions dealing with different aspects of retailing, such as technology and education. Known as the \u201cVoice of Retail,\u201d the NRF prides itself on representing the merchants that impact and connect with the everyday lives of the American consumer.\n\nThe NRF is also a lobbyist group that spends its time, energy, and money lobbying for and supporting legislature that impacts the retail industry and labor practices. For example, in July 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, the NRF lobbied that all retailers adopt a mask mandate for shoppers and employees in all stores.\n\nThe NRF created the NRF Foundation, a nonprofit, to provide resources and experiences for those interested in jobs or long-term careers in retail. Its main goal is to support the next generation of potential retail leaders. The NRF Foundation\u2019s offerings include a career center, job boards, and training. It also provides scholarship programs for retail employees and students.\n\nThe foundation's RISE UP training and credential program offers skills and practical hands-on opportunities for students at over 900 high schools, career, and technical education centers, and workforce boards in the United States. RISE UP's curriculum and exams are industry-recognized. The foundation created this program in collaboration with major retailers, including Walmart, The Home Depot, Burlington Stores, Macy\u2019s, BJs Wholesale Club, and Nordstrom.\n\nAccording to its website, over 400,000 people received RISE Up credentials. In addition, the NRF Foundation has awarded over half-million dollars in college scholarships. It provides in-person and virtual programming to help interested young people and others learn more about the retail industry and gain introductions and insights from industry experts.\n\nThe NRF offers memberships for retailers, industry partners, universities, and global membership, the Federation of International Retail Associations (FIRA). Depending on the membership, NRF offers member-specific networking and event opportunities, access to curated online content, like research reports, and provides opportunities for advocating on policy issues. University members gain access to exclusive events and content designed to benefit students studying the retail industry, plus access to NRF-supported scholarships for students at member universities.\n\nThe cost of membership varies depending on the category. For example, a university membership's annual fee is $1,000, FIRA's annual dues are $1,400, and membership dues for retailers and industry partners vary.\n\nThe National Retail Federation focuses on the strong representation of the retail industry and advocates for policies that support and protect the retail industry. The NRF Foundation works to educate the public about innovation in the industry and educate and encourage those interested in working in the retail market.\n\nThe NRF's Big Show is the oldest (over 100 years old) retail conference and expo in North America. It typically takes place over four days in January at the Javits Center in New York City, where it hosts tens of thousands of guests (over 40,000 in 2020), with over 700 booths, lectures, classrooms, industry gatherings, networking opportunities, guest speakers, new tech demonstrations and innovation labs, and a gala.\n\nIn 2021, the Big Show moved to a virtual format due to the coronavirus pandemic. It will be back at the Javits Center in January 2022 for its usual four days, plus an opening party the night before the conference hall opens.\n\nThe purpose of the National Retail Federation is to act as an advocate for public policy that impacts retailers, to educate lawmakers and the public about the role of retail, to train young people for successful careers in the retail industry, and to provide opportunities for fellowship, networking, and provide insights to NRF members, like universities and associate retailers, among others.\n\nThe National Retail Federation is run by a board of directors and an executive committee. Its chairman is Mike George, president and CEO of Qurate Retail, Inc.\n\nThe NRF offers a Retail Industry Fundamentals credential program that you can earn by enrolling in the 10-lesson certification course. The program offers a broad overview of topics in the retail industry, including workplace safety, economic impacts, customer service, and sales basics.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"Labor Policy Expert Joins Government Relations Team at National Retail Federation.\" Accessed Aug. 11, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"NRF 2022: Retail's Big Show.\" Accessed Aug. 11, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"NRF 2022: Retail's Big Show.\" Accessed Aug.10, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"NRF Membership.\" Accessed Aug.10, 2021\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"About Us.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nThe Hill. \"National Retail Federation Calls for Stores to Set a Nationwide Mask Mandate.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNRF Foundation. \"About Us.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNRF Foundation. \"RISE Up.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"About NRF Membership.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"2020 Recap: Retail's Big Show.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"NRF 2022: Retail's Big Show.\" Accessed Aug. 10, 2021.\n\nNational Retail Federation. \"Board of Directors.\" Accessed Aug. 11, 2021.\n\nPenn Foster. \"Retail Industry Fundamentals Credential.\" Accessed Aug. 11, 2021.",
