Lump sums are commonly associated withpension plansand other retirement vehicles, such as401(k) accounts, where retirees might accept a smaller upfront lump-sum payment rather than a larger payment issued in installments over time.\n\nLump-sum payments can describe a bulk payment to acquire a group of items, such as a company paying one sum for theinventoryof another business.Lotterywinners will also typically have the option to take a lump-sum payout versus yearly payments.\n\nAnnuities provide a degree of financial security, but an older retiree in poor health might derive greater benefit from a lump-sum payment. Securing an upfront payment often guarantees anassetto pass on to yourheirs.\n\nAn upfront payment might enable you tobuy a houseor other large purchase that you would otherwise not be able to afford. Similarly, you can invest the money and potentially earn a higherrate of returnthan the effective rate of return associated with the annual payments.\n\nThe company providing the pension willcalculate the commuted valueof the pension to ensure they can meet their obligations.\n\nTo illustrate how lump-sum andannuity paymentswork, imagine you win $10 million in the lottery. If you take the lump-sum payment, the entire winnings would be subject toincome taxin that year, and you would be in the highesttax bracket.\n\nHowever, if you choose theannuity option, the payments could come to you over several decades. For example, instead of $10 million in income in one year, your annuity payment might be $300,000 a year.\n\nYou would avoid the highest federal income tax bracket of 37% for single people with incomes greater than $609,350 in 2024 ($626,350 in 2025), or $731,200 for married couples filing jointly in 2024 ($751,600 in 2025).\n\nSuch tax questions depend on the size of the lottery win, current income tax rates, projectedincome tax rates, your state of residency when you win, in which state you will live after your win, and investment returns. But if you can earn an annual return of more than 3% to 4%, the lump-sum option usually makes more sense compared to a 30-year annuity.\n\nThere are pros and cons to accepting a lump-sum payment rather than anannuity(fixed payments over a period of time). The right choice depends on the value of the lump sum versus the periodic payments and one\u2019s financial goals.\n\nIt is not always best to take the lump-sum payment in lieu of periodic annual payments; if offered the choice, consider taxes, investments, and thenet present value (NPV), which accounts for the time value of money.\n\nReceiving a lump sum payment is not necessarily risky. However, if you receive it as physical cash, security may be an issue. It may also be risky to deposit the lump sum in one investment option (such as a singlestock), rather thandiversifyingyour investment.Diversificationreduces risk.\n\nA \"lump,\" according to Merriam-Webster, is an adjective that means \"not divided into parts\", or \"entire.\"A \"sum,\" according to the dictionary, is \"an indefinite or specified amount of money\" or \"the whole amount,\" or \"aggregate.\"As a term, \"lump sum\" means \"an amount of money that is paid at one time\" or \"a single sum of money.\"\n\nA lump-sum payment might be an option in multiple situations. In mortgage lending, a \"bullet repayment\" is the lump-sum of the outstanding loan paid to alender. More commonly, you may have a lump-sum option with a pension.\n\nA lump-sum comes with pros and cons. One advantage is that with a lump sum, you have more control up front, and once you receive it, you can invest the money however you wish. However, you may receive less money in a lump sum than you would have if you took periodic payments. Taxes are also a concern.\n\nThis is a situation where it's a good idea to choose carefully. If you have any questions, consider reaching out to a financial advisor.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"",
