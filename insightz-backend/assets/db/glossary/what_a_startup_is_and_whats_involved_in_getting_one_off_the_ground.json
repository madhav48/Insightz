  "definition": "The term \"startup\" refers to a company in the early stages of its operations. Startups are founded by one or more entrepreneurs who want to develop a product or service for which they believe there is demand.\n\nThese companies generally launch with high costs and limited revenue, which is why they look for capital from a variety of sources, such asangel investorsandventure capitalists.\n\nStartups typically require several years to make a profit, so significant,high-risk investmentstypically are needed to get one off the ground.\n\nStartups are companies or ventures that are focused on a single product or service that the founders want to bring to market.\n\nThese companies typically don't have a fully developed business model and, crucially, lack adequate capital to move on to the next phase of business. Most of these companies are initially funded by their founders.\n\nMany startups turn to others for additional financing, including family and friends.Silicon Valleyis known for its strong venture capitalist community and is a popular destination for startups. However, it is widely considered the most demanding arena, as well.\n\nStartups can useseed capitalto invest in research and to develop their business plans. Market research helps determine the demand for a product or service. A comprehensive business plan outlines the company's mission statement, vision, and goals, as well as management and marketing strategies.\n\nThe first few years are very important for startups. Entrepreneurs should use this time to concentrate on raising capital and developing a business model.\n\nThere are a number of different factors that entrepreneurs must think of as they try toget their new business off the groundand begin operations. We've listed some of the most common ones below.\n\nLocation can make or break any business. It's often one of the most important considerations for anyone starting up in the business world. Startups must decide whether their business will operate online, in a brick-and-mortar office or home office, or in a store. The location depends on the product or service being offered.\n\nFor example, a technology startup selling virtual reality hardware may need a physical storefront to give customers a face-to-face demonstration of the product's new and perhaps complex features. Working with people in person can also help develop the relationships that can drive the purchase of what may be expensive items.\n\nStartups need to consider what legal structure best fits their entity. Asole proprietorshipis suited for a founder who is also the key employee of a business.\n\nPartnerships\u00a0are a viable legal structure for businesses that consist of several people who have joint ownership, and they're also fairly straightforward to establish. Personal liability can be reduced by registering a startup as alimited liability company (LLC).\n\nStartups oftenraise funds by turning to family and friendsor by using venture capitalists. Venture capitalists are professional investors that specialize in funding startups.\n\nCrowdfundinghas become a viable way for many people to get access to the cash they need to move forward in the business process. The entrepreneur sets up a crowdfunding page online, allowing people who believe in the company to donate money.\n\nStartups also may use credit to commence their operations. A perfect credit history may help you get a line of credit. Of course, as this is debt that needs to be repaid and often comes with a sizeable interest rate, this option carries the most risk, particularly if the startup is unsuccessful.\n\nOther companies choose small business loans to help fuel growth. Banks typically have several specialized options available for small businesses. For instance, amicroloanis a short-term, low-interest product tailored for startups. A detailed business plan is often required in order to qualify.\n\nThe percentage of new businesses that survive within five years of launch.\n\nThere are a variety of advantages to working for a startup:\n\nOne of the primary disadvantages of a startup is increased risk. This primarily applies to the success and longevity of a startup.\n\nCompetitive business environment\n\nDotcomswere a common startup in the 1990s. Venture capital was extremely easy to obtain during this time due to a frenzy among investors to speculate on the emergence of these new businesses.\n\nUnfortunately, most of these internet startups eventually went bust due to major flaws in their business plans, such as lacking a path to sustainable revenue. However, a handful of companies survived when the dotcom bubble burst. Amazon (AMZN) and eBay (EBAY) are just two examples.\n\nMany startups fail within the first few years. That's why this initial period is important. Entrepreneurs need to find money, create a business model and business plan, hire key personnel, work out intricate details such asequitystakes for partners and investors, and plan for the long run.\n\nMany of today's most successful companies\u2014Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), formerly Facebook, to name a few\u2014began as startups and ended up becoming publicly traded companies.\n\nThe first step is to have a great idea. From there, market research is the next step to determine how feasible the idea is and how it may fit in the current marketplace. After the market research, you'll need to create a business plan that outlines your company structure, goals, mission, values, and objectives.\n\nOne of the most important steps is obtaining funding. This money can come from savings, friends, family, investors, or a loan. After raising funds, make sure you've handled all legal matters and paperwork. This means registering your business and obtaining any required licenses or permits. After this, establish a business location. From there, create an advertising plan to attract customers,establish a customer base, and adapt as your business grows.\n\nA startup canobtain a loan from a startup business loan provider, a bank, certain organizations, or friends and family. One of the best and first options should be working with the U.S. Small Business Administration, which provides microloans to small businesses. These loans are usually from nonprofit community lenders and can be easier to obtain than traditional loans from banks.\n\nThe benefits of working at a startup include greater opportunities to learn about your specific business and business in general, increased responsibility, flexible work hours, a relaxed work environment, increased employee interaction, good workplace benefits, and innovation.\n\nValuing a startup can be difficult as startups don't usually have revenue to show or the marketplace longevity by which to measure success. They usually don't generate profits for a few years after starting. As such, using the traditional financial statement metrics for valuations doesn't apply. Some of the best ways to value a startup include the cost to duplicate, market multiples, discounted cash flow, and valuation by stage.\n\nStarting a company can be a difficult but rewarding venture. Having a great idea and attempting to bring it to market comes with a host of challenges, such as attracting capital, employees, marketing, legal work, and managing finances. Keep in mind, though, that startups can lead to major job satisfaction and the possibility of leaving a legacy.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Choose a Business Structure.\"\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Frequently Asked Questions About Small Business, 2024 Factsheet.\" Page 2.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Microloans.\"",
