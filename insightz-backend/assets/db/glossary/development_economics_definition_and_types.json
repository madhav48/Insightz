  "term": "Development Economics: Definition and Types",
  "definition": "Development economics is a branch ofeconomicsthat focuses on improving fiscal, economic,\u00a0and social conditions indeveloping countries. Development economics considers factors such as health, education, working conditions, domestic and international policies, and market conditions with a focus on improving conditions in the world's poorest countries.\n\nThe field also examines bothmacroeconomic and microeconomicfactors relating to the structure of developing economies and domestic and internationaleconomic growth.\n\nDevelopment economics studies the transformation of emerging nations into more prosperous nations. Strategies for transforming a developing economy tend to be unique because the social and political backgrounds of countries can vary\u00a0dramatically. Not only that, but the cultural and economic frameworks of every nation is different also, such as women's rights and child labor laws.\n\nStudents of economics,\u00a0and professional economists,\u00a0create theories and methods that guide practitioners in determining practices and policies that can be used and implemented at\u00a0the domestic and\u00a0international policy level.\n\nSome aspects of development economics include determining\u00a0to what extent rapid population growth helps or hinders development, the structural transformation of economies, and the role of education andhealthcarein development.\n\nThey also include international trade,globalization, sustainable development, the effects of epidemics, such as HIV, and the impact of catastrophes on economic and human development.\n\nProminent developmenteconomistsinclude Jeffrey Sachs, Hernando de Soto Polar, and Nobel Laureates Simon Kuznets,Amartya Sen, and Joseph Stiglitz.\n\nMercantilismis thought to be one of the earliest forms of development economics that created practices to promote the success of a nation. It was a dominant economic theory practiced in Europe from the 16th to the 18th centuries. The theory\u00a0promoted augmenting state power by lowering exposure to rival national powers.\n\nLike political absolutism and absolute monarchies, mercantilism promoted government regulation by prohibiting colonies from\u00a0transacting with other nations.\n\nMercantilism\u00a0monopolized markets with staple ports and banned gold and silver exports. It believed the higher the supply of gold and silver, the more wealthy it would be. In general, it sought atrade surplus(exports greater than imports), did not allow the use of foreign ships for trade, and it optimized the use of domestic resources.\n\nEconomic nationalism reflects\u00a0policies that focus on domestic control ofcapital formation, the economy, and labor, using tariffs or other barriers. It restricts\u00a0the movement of capital, goods, and labor.\n\nEconomic nationalists do not generally agree with the benefits of globalization and unlimitedfree trade. They focus on a policy that is isolationist so that the industries within a nation are able to grow without the threat of competition from established companies in other countries.\n\nThe economy of the early United States is a prime example of economic nationalism. As a new nation, it sought to develop itself without relying so much on outside influences. It enacted measures, such as high tariffs, so its own industries would grow unimpeded.\n\nThe linear stages of growth model was used to revitalize the European economy after World War II.\n\nThis model\u00a0states that economic growth can only stem fromindustrialization. The model also agrees that local institutions and social attitudes can restrict growth\u00a0if these factors influence people'ssavings ratesand investments.\n\nThe linear stages of growth model portrays an appropriately designed addition of capital partnered with public intervention. This injection of capital and restrictions from the public sector leads to economic development and industrialization.\n\nThe structural-change theory focuses on changing the overall economic structure of a nation, which aims to shift society from being a primarily agrarian one to a primarily industrial one. For example, Russia before the communist revolution was an agrarian society. When the communists overthrew the royal family and took power, they rapidly industrialized the nation, allowing it to eventually become a superpower.\n\nDevelopment economics is the study of how emerging nations become more financially stable. It can be used as a tool for\u00a0students and economists working to develop policies that can be used in creating domestic and international policy.\n\nUltimately, the study of development economics is meant to help better the financial, economic and social circumstances in developing countries through the enactment\u00a0of certain structures and policies.\n\nThe topics, or types of development economics include mercantilism, economic nationalism, linear stages of growth model, and structural-change theory.\n\nDevelopment economics examines things like the structure of domestic and international economies in order to improve conditions in developing countries. There are many theories of development economics. While mercantilism, nationalism, linear stages of growth, and structural-change theory are four of the most common, this field of study continues to develop and change.\n\nThe Nobel Prize. \"All Prizes in Economic Sciences.\"\n\nWorld Scientific. \"Mercantilism in Perspective: A Historic Review.\"\n\nPryke, Sam. \"Economic Nationalism: Theory, History and Prospects,\"Global Policy, vol. 3, no. 1, 2012, pp. 281-291.\n\nU.S. Senate. \"Classic Senate Speeches.\"\n\nSean Gallagher. \"Banking Performance and Socio Economic Development,\" Pages 260-261.
