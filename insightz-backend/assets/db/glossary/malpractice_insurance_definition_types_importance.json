Malpractice insurance also covers the death of a patient.\n\nMost medical doctors will need malpractice insurance sometime during their professional career, and for good reason. A study by Johns Hopkins University found medical errors to be the third leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer. Medical negligence can happen during diagnosis, during treatment, or as part of the advice given for treatment after an illness. Approximately 250,000 deaths in the U.S. arise from medical errors every year.\n\nAccording to government data, roughly 10,800 medical malpractice claims were paid in 2022.Nearly one third of physicians report they have been sued at least once in their careers.This underlines the importance of having malpractice insurance for a healthcare professional.\n\nMedical malpractice insurance requirements vary by state. Some states specifically require insurance, while others require a minimum amount of coverage to participate in state programs designed to assist them with claims.\n\nMedical malpractice insurance premiums are usually based on the physician's specialty and geographic location,\u00a0not onclaimsexperience. This means that even if a physician has never been sued, they can end up paying extremely high premiums.

A claims-made policy only covers claims if the policy was in effect when the treatment occurred and when the lawsuit was made. An occurrence policy covers any claim that was made on a treatment that occurred while the policy was in effect, even if the policy has since expired.\n\nThe types of costs covered under a malpractice policy are wide. They include all legal fees, such as lawyer fees, settlement and arbitration costs, medical damages, and punitive damages.\n\nIn a medical malpractice lawsuit, the plaintiff\u00a0needs to prove a medical professional violated the generalstandard of care of a patient, as defined by the medical community.
