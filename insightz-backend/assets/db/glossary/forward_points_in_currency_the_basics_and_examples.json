  "term": "Forward Points in Currency: The Basics and Examples",
  "definition": "In currency trading, forward points are the number ofbasis pointsadded to or subtracted from the currentspot rateof a currency pair to determine the forward rate for delivery on a specific value date. When points are added to the spot rate\u00a0this is called a forward premium; when points are subtracted from the spot rate it is\u00a0a forward discount.\n\nTheforward rateis based on the difference between the interest rates of the two currencies (currency deals always involve two currencies) and the time until the maturity of the deal.\u00a0Forward points are also known as theforward spread.\n\nBasis points can be either added or taken away from the spot rate. If they are added, they are forward points. If subtracted, they are discount points.\n\nForward points are used to calculate the price for both an outrightforward contractand aforeign currency swap. Points can be calculated and transactions executed for any date that is a valid business day in both currencies. The most commonly traded forward currencies are the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound, and the Swiss franc.\n\nForwards are most commonly done for periods of up to one year. Prices for further out dates are available, butliquidityis generally\u00a0lower. In anoutright forward foreign exchange contract, one currency is bought against another for delivery on any date beyond the spot. The price is the spot rate plus or minus the forward points to the value date. No money changes hands until thevalue date.\n\nIn a foreign exchange swap, a currency is bought for the near date (usually spot) against another currency, and the same amount is sold back for the forward date. The rate for the forward leg of the swap is the near-date rate plus or minus the forward points to the far date. Money changes hands on both value dates.\n\nA forward contract is different from a swap contract. In a forward, traders agree to exchange an asset at a future date; in a swap, they exchange the interest rates generated by the assets.\n\nIn contrast to the forward spread, adiscount spreadis the currency\u00a0forward points\u00a0that are subtracted from the\u00a0spot rate, to obtain a\u00a0forward rate\u00a0for a currency. In the currency markets, forward spreads, or points, are presented as two-way quotes; that is, they have a bid price and an offer price. In a discount spread, the bid price will be higher than the offer price, while in a premium spread, the bid price will be lower than the offer price.\n\nCurrency traders seek to profit from the difference in interest payments from the currencies that they hold.\n\nForward points are often quoted in\u00a0numbers, such as +13.2 or minus -270.68. These represent 1/10,000, so +13.2\u00a0means 0.00132\u00a0when added to a currency spot price.\n\nFor example, if the euro can be bought versus the dollar at the rate of 1.1350 for spot, and the forward points\u00a0are +13.2, the\u00a0forward rate is 1.13632 (or 1.1350 + 0.00132).\n\nBased on this information we can determine that the interest rate in the U.S. is higher than that in the Eurozone. The positive forward points when buying the EUR/USD tell us that the rate goes up the further out into the future we go. This is because the forward points compensate for the difference in interest rates between the two currencies.\n\nExpressed a different way, if the euro interest rate is 1% and the U.S. interest rate is 2%, a trader could make a 1% difference by holding U.S. dollars instead of euros. So when exchanging or locking in currency exchange rates for the future (forward rate) this needs to be\u00a0factored in.\n\nSwap points reflect the expected interest rate on a currency swap. Positive swap points indicate that a trader will earn interest on the sold currency, while negative interest rates mean that they will owe interest.\n\nForwardsand swaps are both derivative instruments based on the price of an underlying asset. The difference is that a forward contract entails the delivery of the underlying asset at a future date, while a swap contract only transfers the interest payments from the underlying asset.\n\nThe forward rate on a bond is based on thedifference in intereston the spot rates for bonds of different maturities. It is calculated by dividing the interest rate of the longer-term bond by that of the shorter-term one, and subtracting one from the result.\n\nForward points, or swap points, measure the difference between the current spot price of a currency pair and the price when the deal matures. If forward points are added, the trader expects to earn interest; if they are subtracted, the trader expects to pay interest.",
