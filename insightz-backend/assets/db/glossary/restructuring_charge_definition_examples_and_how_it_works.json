  "definition": "Arestructuringcharge is aone-time expensethat a company pays when reorganizing its operations.\n\nExamples of one-time expenses include furloughing or laying off employees, closing manufacturing plants, and shifting production to a new location.\n\nCompanies undertake these moves in an effort to boost profitability, but first take a one-off hit in the form of an upfront restructuring charge. The idea is that, once that charge is taken, there should be no other expenses related to the particular reorganization.\n\nCompanies restructure their operations to improve efficiency and boost profitability over the long-term. So, restructuring charges can occur for a variety of reasons.\n\nThese include when a company makes anacquisition, sells asubsidiary, downsizes, implements new technology, relocatesassets, decreases orconsolidates debt, diversifies into a new market, orwrites offassets.\n\nWhatever the reason, a company restructuring is usually driven by a need for change in the organization or business model. For instance, a company that chooses to restructure is often experiencing significant problems such that it is prepared to stomach certain added costs to improve its fortunes.\n\nRestructuring charges arenonrecurring operating expensesthat show up as a line item on theincome statementand factor intonet income.\n\nBecause the charge is an unusual or infrequent expense, it is unlikely that it will impactshareholders' stakes in the company. In other words, news of a restructuring charge probably won't significantly impact a company's share price.\n\nTo find out more details about a restructuring charge, investors should consult the relevantfootnote to the financial statements. Additional information might also be found in themanagement discussion and analysis (MD&A)section of the financial statement.\n\nA restructuring charge will cost a company in the short term, but should save it money in the long run.\n\nDue to worrisome industry forecasts, Company A has decided to downsize operations. It lays off several employees who each receiveseverance checks. The severance cost associated with this structural change in the business is a restructuring charge.\n\nIn contrast, Company Z is flourishing and growing rapidly. The company decides to hire more employees to keep up with its expansion. The costs associated with hiring new staff, such as signing bonuses\u00a0and acquiring more office space, are also classified as restructuring charges.\n\nA restructuring charge will be mentioned in financial analyses as decreasing a company'soperating incomeanddiluted earnings. As a result, restructuring charges will often have a significant impact on a company's income statement.\n\nNet income may be manipulated by inflating the amount for a restructuring charge. The charge is purposely exaggerated in order to create an expense reserve that will be used to offset ongoingoperating expenses.\n\nCreative accountantsuse the restructuring provision to get rid of losses through one-time charges and to clean out the books.\n\nIn effect, a large restructuring charge is reported so the company can take a big hit to earnings in the current period in order to make future period earnings appear more profitable.\n\nAnalystsclosely scrutinize any restructuring charge that shows up on a company's income statement to see if a company may have charged a recurring expense to its restructuring account.\n\nYou might see restructuring charges that relate to obtaining a bigger production facility, closing an office building, or paying bonuses to high-value employees to keep them from moving to competitors. Or they might be expenses related to training new hires and purchasing much needed manufacturing equipment.\n\nNot always. They're made when a company feels that a reorganization is necessary for its financial well-being, which can be for a variety of reasons. For instance, they can occur when high demand for a company's products requires it to add more production space and employees. But they also can occur when a slow economy has depressed consumer spending and a company must shut down a plant to save money.\n\nAs big (or small) as the associated expenses dictate it needs to be. For instance, in early 2023, the company Meta (which owns Facebook) announced a $4.2 billion restructuring charge relating to its plan to terminate office leases, make severance payments to laid-off workers, and more.\n\nA restructuring charge is a nonrecurring (one-time), upfront charge that a company posts to reflect expenses to be paid when a company reorganizes an aspect of its business. The goal of the restructuring charge (and reorganization) is to eliminate certain future expenses, improve company profitability, and pave the way for long-term financial success.\n\nThe New York Times. \"Meta Posts $4.2 Billion Restructuring Charge.\"",
