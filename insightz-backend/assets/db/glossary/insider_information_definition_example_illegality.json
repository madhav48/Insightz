  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nInsider information is a fact about a public company's plans or finances that has not yet been revealed to shareholders and that could give an unfair advantage to its possessors if acted upon. Buying or selling stock based on insider information can be a criminal offense.\n\nInsider\u00a0information is usually available to executives working within or close to a public company.\n\nA limited number of people inside a company inevitably know about an event that will, once it is revealed, will significantly affect the company's stock price. It might be a pending merger, a product recall, a shortfall in earnings, or the failure of a major project. In extreme cases, it might be a financial scandal that is about to burst into public view.\n\nThe people who are in the know are not just sworn to confidentiality. They are forbidden by law to take advantage of that knowledge by buying or selling stock in the company, or by passing along the information to someone else who takes advantage of it.\n\nInsider tradingis illegal when the material information has not been made public and has been traded on.It is\u00a0seen as an unfair manipulation of the free market to give an advantage to certain parties. Ultimately, it undermines confidence in the integrity of the market and can dampen economic growth.\n\nA person who uses insider information to place trades, or advises a third party to place trades based on the information, can be found guilty of insider trading.\n\nObviously, company insiders own stock and they buy and sell shares from time to time. Not all insider trading is illegal.\n\nIn the U.S., theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)regulates\u00a0legal insider trades. Trading in company stock by its executives, directors, and employees is subject to regulations encoded in the1934 Securities Exchange Act.\n\nThe enforceable definition of insider trading has been expanded since the law's passage through a series of high-profile securities fraud rulings and loophole-closing legislation.\n\nFor instance, in 2000, the Congress passedRegulation Fair Disclosure (Regulation FD), which was meant to curb selective disclosure of information by companies to some shareholders or other traders. It stipulates that any time a firm is disclosing previously non-public information to an interested party, they must make that information public and available to all traders.\n\nThe SEC prosecutes trading based on insider information\u00a0as a serious fraud crime and individuals found guilty can be heavily fined or imprisoned. The business mogul and media personalityMartha Stewartwas indicted in 2003 onsecurities fraudand other charges after trading to avoid\u00a0a loss based on insider information. She was imprisoned for five months and paid a disgorgement of $45,673 plus prejudgment interest of $12,389, and a civil penalty of $137,019.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Selective Disclosure and Insider Trading.\" Accessed Sept. 29, 2021.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry.\" Accessed Sept. 29, 2021.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Martha Stewart and Peter Bacanovic Agree to Settle SEC Insider Trading Charges.\" Accessed Sept. 29, 2021.",
