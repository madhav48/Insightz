  "term": "What Is Unskilled Labor and Why Is the Term Outdated?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\n\"Unskilled labor\" is an outdated term that was once used to describe a segment of the workforce associated with a limited skill set or minimaleconomic valuefor the work performed. The correct term in 2025 is low-wage labor.\n\nThe terms unskilled and skilled were derived from institutions, politicians, and other interest groups, according to the Center for Global Development. A determination has been made as to who is and isn't powerful in the labor market based on these classifications. The idea that the unskilled labor force is characterized by lower educational attainment such as having high school diplomas or GEDs and that this typically results in lower wages is also outdated.\n\nIt was assumed thatunskilled laborersmade less money when they were characterized by lower educational attainment but there are jobs for high school graduates or those without college degrees in the 21st century.\n\nLow-wage laborers provide a significant part of the overalllabor market, performing daily production tasks that don't depend on technical abilities or skills. Repetitive tasks are typical unskilled labor positions. Jobs that can be fully learned in less than 30 days often fall into the low-wage labor category. Low-wage labor jobs may be held by individuals with less education or experience than others.\n\nEmployers may take advantage of these workers when this is the case, offering low to minimum wage as pay.\n\nLow-wage labor refers to the lack of education or experience a person may have when the term is used to describe an employee completing these tasks. The U.S. Department of Labor states thefederal minimum wageis $7.25 an hour in 2025.Many cities and states have a higher minimum wage for their workers, however.Twenty-one states raised their minimum wages effective Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nCertain semiskilled jobs such as those held by administrative assistants can require advanced skill sets that lead them to be categorized as skilled instead of semiskilled positions.\n\nAll jobs from babysitters to biology professors require a skill set but some jobs and careers require higher education, certifications, or a certain number of years of experience. Entry-level positions can be low-wage with rising salaries as more experience is gained. Some low-wage jobs only pay federal minimum wage which doesn't often increase on the job despite the use of skills and experience of the low-wage worker. Rising skills and pay may depend on the employer and the position.\n\nJobs that call for semi-skilled or mid-skilled workers typically require a level of education, knowledge in a particular field, or experience and training to complete the job's tasks successfully.\n\nSkilled labormay refer to persons or positions that require a very specialized skill set or advanced degree to complete some of the assigned tasks.\n\nThe federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour as of 2025.\n\nAll jobs take some measure of skill to perform but skilled labor usually refers to positions that require a very specific skill set to obtain. These might include computer coding, plumbing skills, or a teaching certificate.\n\nThirty states and the District of Columbia had higher minimum wage rates than the federal government as of Jan. 1, 2025. The Virgin Islands, Guam, and Puerto Rico also had higher minimum wage rates.\n\nThe term \"low-skilled\" worker is antiquated and not reflective of the present day. Low-wage workers aren't low-skilled workers. They may have plenty of skills but low-wage jobs often don't provide aliveable wage.\n\nCenter for Global Development. \"There's No Such Thing as a 'Low'-Skill Worker.\"\n\nIndeed. \"Skilled, Semiskilled and Unskilled Labor Compared.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. \"Minimum Wage.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. \"State Minimum Wage Laws.\"\n\nEconomic Policy Institute. \"Over 9.2 Million Workers Will Get a Raise on January 1 from 21 States Raising Their Minimum Wages.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor Wage and Hour Division. \"Consolidated Minimum Wage Table.\"",
