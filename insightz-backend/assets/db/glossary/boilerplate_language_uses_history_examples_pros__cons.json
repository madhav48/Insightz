In this case, the IT specialist only has to rework some of the code to fit into the current need, without making major changes to the original structure.\n\nBoilerplate can be described as the standard text portion of a template. It provides the user with a basic structure that can be altered to suit different needs.\n\nIn the 19th century, a boilerplate was a steel slab used as a template in the construction of steam boilers.

Boilerplate clauses are designed not only to save time but also to protect businesses from making errors or legal mistakes in documents.\n\nThe wording of these passages is generally not up for negotiation with customers, who will often sign boilerplate documents without actually reading or understanding them.
