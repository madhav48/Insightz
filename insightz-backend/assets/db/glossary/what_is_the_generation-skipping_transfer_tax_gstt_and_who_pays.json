  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax is a federal tax on a gift orinheritancethat prevents the donor from avoiding estate taxes by skipping children in favor of grandchildren. With the generation-skipping transfer tax, grandchildren receive the same amount as if the inheritance were coming from their parents.\n\nBefore the generation-skipping transfer tax was introduced in 1976, wealthy individuals were legally able to gift money and bequeath property to their grandchildren, without paying federalestate taxesthe way they would if the bequest had been made to their children. The legislation effectively closed the loophole where inheritances could skip a generation to avoid double estate taxation.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT) is an additional tax on a transfer of property that skips a generation, known as a generation-skipping transfer (GST) for short. The GSTT was implemented to prevent families from avoiding the estate tax for one or more generations by makinggiftsor bequests directly to grandchildren or great-grandchildren.\n\nThe parent's generation is skipped to avoid an inheritance being subject to estate taxes twice. The GSTT ensures that grandchildren end up with the same value of assets that they would have had if the inheritance was transferred to them directly from their parents, rather than their grandparents.\n\nThe person giving the gift is referred to as thetransferorand the recipient is known as the skip person. Many people use a grandchild as a skip person, but a skip person does not have to be a family member. Any individual is eligible to receive a generation-skipping transfer as long as they are at least 37\u00bd years younger than the transferor.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax is imposed only if the transfer avoids incurring a gift or estate tax at each generation level. To make up for the taxes that may be avoided by skipping one generation, theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)imposes a second layer of tax on gifts and bequests above the estate and lifetime gift exclusion. It means that the GSTT is only due when a beneficiary receives amounts in excess of the GST estate tax credit.\n\nThe taxation of a GST depends on whether the transfer is a direct or an indirect skip.\u00a0A direct skip is a property transfer that's subject to an estate or gift tax.\u00a0An example of a direct skip would be a grandmother gifting property to a grandchild. The transferor or their estate is responsible for paying the GST tax for direct skips.\n\nAn indirect skip involves a transfer that has intermediate steps before reaching a skip person. There are two types of indirect skips: the taxable termination and the taxable distribution.\n\nA taxable termination involves a skip person and a non-skip person.\u00a0A non-skip person is the primarybeneficiarywho will receive property before it is transferred to the skip person. The transfer to the skip person occurs upon the death of a non-skip person\u2014typically the child of the transferor.\n\nAs an example of a taxable termination, consider a transferor who establishes an income-producing trust for his son. Upon the son's death, the remaining property would be passed on to the transferor's grandchild, at which time those assets would be subject to the GST tax.\n\nA taxable distribution refers to any distribution of income or property, from atrustto a skip person that isnototherwise subject to estate or gift tax.\u00a0If a grandmother established a trust that made payments to her grandson, those payments would be subject to GST taxes, which the recipient is responsible for paying.\n\nIn the past, the GSTT has been hefty, ranging from 35% to 77%.The current rate, which has been in effect since 2014, is 40%; however, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed in 2017, dramatically decreased the number of estates that might be affected by it by raising the exemption level.\n\nFor 2024, the federal estate, gift, and GSTT exemption is $13.61 million for each individual ($13.99 million in 2025) and $27.22 million for married couples ($27.98 million in 2025). The pre-TCJA limit in 2017 was $5.49 million for individuals.\n\nSome states also collect generation-skipping transfer taxes, generally the ones that impose their own estate taxes.\n\nOnly the value of a person\u2019s estate that is in excess of the applicable exemption is subject to an estate tax at death or the GSTT. So only aggregate gifts and bequests to a skip person in excess of $13.61 million ($13.99 million in 2025) would be subject to the 40% flat generation-skipping transfer tax.\n\nThe GSTT is assessed when the gift or property transfer is made; GSTs can occur before or after the death of the transferor. While still alive, the transferor can give the gift directly to the skip person; depending on the size of the gift, federal gift taxes may be due.\u00a0Upon death, the transferor's will may either stipulate that property is bequeathed to a skip person, or it may call for the establishment of a trust from which distributions will be made.Form 709is used to report both GST taxes and transfers that are subject to federalgift taxes.\n\nMost beneficiaries will avoid the generation-skipping transfer tax because the estates they inherit will be worth less than the government-provided estate tax credit. The GSTT exemption is very high, as noted above.\n\nHowever, in cases where the tax could apply, transferors can createdynasty trusts, which are designed to avoid or minimize estate taxes with each generational transfer. By parking assets in the trust and making specified distributions to each generation, the corpus of the trust isn\u2019t subject to estate taxes with the transfer.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax is triggered when a person gifts another person an asset but skips a generation in doing so. For example, a person could stipulate in their will that their home and other assets will go to their grandchild, skipping their child (the grandchild's parent).\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax is paid by either the grantor or the skipped beneficiary depending on how the bequest is structured. The grantor pays the direct generation-skipping tax, while an indirect generation-skipping tax is paid by the skipped beneficiary. The former is the most common scenario.\n\nGifts are tax-free up to a certain limit. In 2024, a parent can gift a child $18,000 tax-free. In 2025, the tax-free gift amount is $19,000.These amounts are per parent and per recipient. So, for example, in 2025, two parents could each gift an adult child and that child's spouse $19,000, for a total of $76,000 gifted tax-free to the couple.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax (GSTT) is a federal tax on property transfered to beneficiary (other than a spouse) who is 37\u00bd years or more younger than the person making the gift or bequest. This tax was designed to close a loophole that allowed the wealthy to avoid estate taxes by making bequests to grandchildren, rather than children.\n\nThe GSTT is a flate-rate tax of 40%, but most estates will never be subject to it. Estates must be larger than the federal estate tax exemption, which was raised by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 and subsequently adjusted for inflation. In 2024, estates must be larger than $13.61 million to be subject to estate taxes; in 2025, this amount rises to $13.99 million.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"The Estate Tax: Ninety Years and Counting,\" Pages 121-123.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706-GS(T): Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,\" Page 7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Estate Tax.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706-GS(T): Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,\" Pages 1-2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706-GS(T): Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,\" Page 6.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706,\" Page 46.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706-GS(T): Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return for Terminations,\" Pages 1-3.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706-GS(D),\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"The Estate Tax: Ninety Years and Counting,\" Pages 122-124.\n\nWealthspire Advisors LLC. \"2023 Federal & State Estate and Gift Tax Cheat Sheet.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 709: United States Gift (and Generation-Skipping Transfer) Tax Return,\" Pages 1, 8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes,\" Select \"How many annual exclusions are available?\"",
