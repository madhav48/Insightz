  "term": "What Is a Bond Fund? How It Works, Benefits, Taxes, and Types",
  "definition": "A bond fund is a mutual fund or ETF that invests primarily in government and corporate bonds.\n\nA bond fund is amutual fundor anexchange-traded fund(ETF) that buys and sells debt instruments like government and corporate bonds. The primary goal of a bond fund is to generate monthly income for investors.\n\nFor an investor, a bond fund is an alternative to buying individual bonds. The investor in a bond fund is buying shares in a fund that buys and sells many bonds. Typically, a bondfund managerbuys and sells according to market conditions and rarely holds bonds until maturity.\n\nFor many investors, a bond fund is a more efficient way of investing than buying individual bond securities. Unlike individual bond securities, bond funds do not have amaturity datefor the repayment of principal, so the principal amount invested may fluctuate from time to time.\n\nInvestors in bond funds receive monthly payments that reflect the mix of all the bonds in the fund, which means that the interest income payment will vary monthly.\n\nBonds are rated according to the degree of risk that their issuers will default on their debts. An \"AAA\" or \"AA\" bond is issued by a company or government that is highly unlikely to default. An \"F\" bond is on the edge.\n\nMost bond funds are comprised of a certain type of bond, such ascorporateorgovernment bonds.\n\nThey also focus on a time to maturity, such asshort-term, intermediate-term, and long-term.\n\nInvestors can choose bond funds that buy only the highest-quality and safest bonds, such as U.S. government bonds or the bonds of blue-chip companies. High-quality bonds pay lower interest than riskier bonds.\n\nInvestors should note that U.S. government bonds are considered to be of the highest credit quality.Bond funds that specialize in U.S. Treasury securities, includingTreasury inflation-protected securities(TIPS), are the safest but offer the lowest potential return.\n\nOther funds invest in only riskier bonds\u2014high-yield orjunk bonds. Bond funds that invest in riskier bonds offer higher returns along with a higher risk of default by the bond issuer.\n\nThere are also bond funds that have a mix of the different types of bonds to createmulti-asset classoptions.\n\nThe types of funds available include US government bond funds, municipal bond funds, corporate bond funds, mortgage-backed securities (MBS) funds, high-yield bond funds, emerging market bond funds, andglobal bond funds.\n\nMutual funds have been investing in bonds for many years. Some of the oldestbalanced funds, which include allocations to both stock and bonds, date back to the late 1920s.\n\nBond funds are an attractive option compared to buying individual bonds. They provide greater portfolio diversification than an individual investor could manage independently.\n\nBy investing in a bond fund, an investor only needs to pay theannual expense ratiothat covers marketing, administrative, and professional management fees. The alternative is to purchase multiple bonds separately and deal with thetransaction costsassociated with each.\n\nSince a fund usually invests in many bonds of varying maturities, the impact of any single bond\u2019s performance is lessened.\n\nAnother benefit of a bond mutual fund is that it provides access to professional portfolio managers with the expertise to research and analyze thecreditworthinessof bond issuers and market conditions before buying into or selling out of the fund.\n\nFor example, a fund manager may replace bonds when the issuer'scredit is downgradedor when the issuer \"calls,\" or pays off the bond, before its maturity date.\n\nBond funds can be sold at any time for their current marketnet asset value(NAV), which may result in a capital gain or loss. Individual bonds can be harder to unload.\n\nFrom a tax perspective, some investors in higher tax brackets may find that they have a higherafter-tax yieldfrom a tax-free municipal bond fund investment rather than a taxable bond fund investment.\n\nDue to theinverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices, a long-term bond carries greaterinterest rate riskthan a short-term bond. Therefore, the NAV of bond funds with longer-term maturities will be impacted greatly by changes in interest rates. This, in turn, will affect how much interest income the fund can distribute to its participants monthly.\n\nBond ETFs have been around for less time than bond mutual funds, withiShareslaunching the first bond ETF fund in 2002.Most of these offerings seek to replicate various bondindices, although a growing number of actively managed products are also available.\n\nETFsoften have lower fees than their mutual fund counterparts. Like stocks, ETFs trade throughout the day. The prices for shares can fluctuate moment by moment and may vary quite a bit over the course of a day's trading.\n\nBond ETFs operate much likeclosed-end funds, in that they are purchased through a brokerage account rather than directly from a fund company.\n\nWhen the investor wishes to sell, ETFs must be traded on the open market. The fund company will not purchase the shares, as is done for open-ended mutual funds.\n\nA bond fund is a mutual fund or ETF that invests in bonds instead of stocks. They can invest in Treasury bonds, municipal bonds, or corporate bonds. Some bond funds only invest in the safest bonds, and some invest in junk bonds with higher returns.\n\nBuying a bond fund allows you to get exposure to a large basket of bonds, without having to research the characteristics of each individual bond. Bonds are considered relatively safe, but they are sensitive to interest rate changes. The value of a bond fund can fall when interest rates go up.\n\nThere is a wide variety of bond ETFs and bond mutual funds to choose from. They include funds that invest in California municipal bonds, U.S. or international government bonds, investment-grade corporate bonds, and tax-exempt bonds. Funds may invest in short-term, medium-term, or long-term bonds.\n\nThe three largest bond ETFs at this writing are the iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond ETF (AGG), the Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and the Vanguard Total International Bond ETF (BNDX).\n\nAs of the end of the first quarter of 2025, the best-performing bond mutual funds among the top 10 largest funds, and their one-year performance, were:\n\nBond ETFs and bond mutual funds are an alternative to individual bond-picking for the investor interested in a steady stream of income.\n\nLike bonds, bond funds are generally a choice for the conservative investor. As with any investment, a little more risk has the potential for a relatively larger return.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Bond Funds and Income Funds.\"\n\nAmerican Economic Association. \"What Makes US Government Bonds Safe Assets?\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Bonds.\"\n\niShares. \"Bonds Still have a Big Role to Play in Portfolios.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Bulletin: Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs).\"\n\nMorningstar. \"How the Largest Bond Funds Did Last Quarter.\"",
