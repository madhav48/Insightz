  "term": "What Is a Two-Tailed Test? Definition and Example",
  "definition": "A two-tailed test, in statistics, is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. It is used innull-hypothesistesting and testing forstatistical significance. If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.\n\nA basic concept of inferential statistics ishypothesis testing, which determines whether a claim is true or not given a population parameter. A hypothesis test that is designed to show whether the mean of a sample is significantly greater than and significantly less than the mean of a population is referred to as a two-tailed test. The two-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under both tails of anormal distribution, although the test can be used in other non-normal distributions.\n\nA two-tailed test is designed to examine both sides of a specified data range as designated by theprobability distributioninvolved. The probability distribution should represent the likelihood of a specified outcome based on predetermined standards. This requires the setting of a limit designating the highest (or upper) and lowest (or lower) accepted variable values included within the range. Any data point that exists above the upper limit or below the lower limit is considered out of the acceptance range and in an area referred to as the rejection range.\n\nThere is no inherent standard about the number of data points that must exist within the acceptance range. In instances where precision is required, such as in the creation of pharmaceutical drugs, a rejection rate of 0.001% or less may be instituted. In instances where precision is less critical, such as the number of food items in a product bag, a rejection rate of 5% may be appropriate.\n\nA two-tailed test can also be used practically during certain production activities in a firm, such as with the production and packaging of candy at a particular facility. If the production facility designates 50 candies per bag as its goal, with an acceptable distribution of 45 to 55 candies, any bag found with an amount below 45 or above 55 is considered within the rejection range.\n\nTo confirm the packaging mechanisms are properly calibrated to meet the expected output,random samplingmay be taken to confirm accuracy. A simple random sample takes a small, random portion of the entire population to represent the entire data set, where each member has an equal probability of being chosen.\n\nFor the packaging mechanisms to be considered accurate, an average of 50 candies per bag with an appropriate distribution is desired. Additionally, the number of bags that fall within the rejection range needs to fall within the probability distribution limit considered acceptable as an error rate. Here, the null hypothesis would be that the mean is 50 while the alternate hypothesis would be that it is not 50.\n\nIf, after conducting the two-tailed test, thez-scorefalls in the rejection region, meaning that the deviation is too far from the desired mean, then adjustments to the facility or associated equipment may be required to correct the error. Regular use of two-tailed testing methods can help ensure production stays within limits over the long term.\n\nBe careful to note if a statistical test is one- or two-tailed as this will greatly influence a model's interpretation.\n\nWhen a hypothesis test is set up to show that the sample mean would be only higher than the population mean, this is referred to as aone-tailed test. A formulation of this hypothesis would be, for example, that \"the returns on an investment fund would beat leastx%.\" One-tailed tests could also be set up to show that the sample mean could be only less than the population mean. The key difference from a two-tailed test is that in a two-tailed test, the sample mean could be different from the population mean by beingeitherhigher or lower than it.\n\nIf the sample\u00a0being tested falls into the one-sided critical area, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted instead of the null hypothesis. A one-tailed test is also known as a directional hypothesis or directional\u00a0test.\n\nA two-tailed test, on the other hand, is designed to examine both sides of a specified data range to test whether a sample is greater than or less than the range of values.\n\nAs a hypothetical example, imagine that a newstockbroker, named XYZ, claims that their\u00a0brokerage fees\u00a0are lower than that of your current stockbroker, ABC) Data available from an independent research firm indicates that the mean and standard deviation of all ABC broker clients are $18 and $6, respectively.\n\nA sample of 100 clients of ABC is taken, and brokerage charges are calculated with the new rates of XYZ broker. If the mean of the sample is $18.75 and the sample standard deviation is $6, can any inference be made about the difference in the average brokerage bill between ABC and XYZ broker?\n\nThis calculated Z value falls between the two limits defined by: - Z2.5= -1.96 and Z2.5= 1.96.\n\nThis concludes that there is insufficient evidence to infer that there is any difference between the rates of your existing broker and the new broker. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Alternatively, the p-value = P(Z< -1.25)+P(Z >1.25) = 2 * 0.1056 = 0.2112 = 21.12%, which is greater than 0.05 or 5%, leads to the same conclusion.\n\nA two-tailed test is designed to determine whether a claim is true or not given a population parameter. It examines both sides of a specified data range as designated by the probability distribution involved. As such, the probability distribution should represent the likelihood of a specified outcome based on predetermined standards.\n\nA two-tailed hypothesis test is designed to show whether the sample mean is significantly greater thanorsignificantly less than the mean of a population. The two-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under both tails (sides) of a normal distribution. A one-tailed hypothesis test, on the other hand, is set up to show only one test; that the sample mean would be higher than the population mean, or, in a separate test, that the sample mean would be lower than the population mean.\n\nA Z-score numerically describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values and is measured in terms of the number of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score whereas Z-scores of 1.0 and -1.0 would indicate values one standard deviation above or below the mean. In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean.\n\nSan Jose State University. \"6: Introduction to Null Hypothesis Significance Testing.\"",
