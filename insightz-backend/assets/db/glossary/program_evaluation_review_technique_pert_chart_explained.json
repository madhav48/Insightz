A PERT chart allows users to communicate project instructions as well as set schedules and timelines.\n\nA PERT chart uses\u00a0nodes (circles or rectangles) to represent project events or milestones.\n\nThe nodes are linked by vectors (lines) that represent various tasks. Dependent tasks are items that must be performed in a specific manner. For example, if an arrow is drawn from task 1 to task 2 on a PERT chart, task 1 must be completed before work on task 2 begins.\n\nItems at the same stage of production but on different task lines within a project are referred to as parallel tasks. They're independent of\u00a0each other and occur at the same time.\n\nA well-constructed PERT chart looks like this.\n\nA project manager creates a PERT chart in order to analyze all of a project's tasks while estimating the amount of time required to complete each one. Using this information, the project manager can estimate the minimum amount of time required to complete the entire project.\n\nThis information also helps the manager develop aproject budgetand determine the resources needed to accomplish the project.\n\nA PERT chart may make it easier to see and track a project's critical path. The critical path is the minimum time it will take to complete a project, based on the longest path from start to finish.\n\nA PERT chart is a visual representation of a series of events that must occur within thescopeof a project\u2019s lifetime. The direction of the arrows indicates the flow and sequence of events required.\n\nDotted activity lines represent dummy activities. These are items that are located on another PERT path. Numbers and time allotments are assigned and shown\u00a0inside each vector.\n\nThese charts have their distinct definitions and terms, the most important of which is anticipating how long it will take to finalize a project:\n\nA PERT chart is similar to acritical path analysis, which is another method that project managers use to chart tasks in a project. The main difference between the two is that a PERT chart uses various time frames and probability terms when estimating each project stage.\n\nAs a project management tool, PERT charts have distinct advantages and disadvantages.\n\nA PERT chart allows a manager to evaluate the time and resources necessary to complete a project. It also allows the manager to trackrequired assetsduring any stage of production in the course of the project.\n\nPERT analysis incorporates data and information supplied by a number of departments. This combining of information encourages department responsibility and identifies all responsible parties across the organization.\n\nIt also improves communication during the project and it allows an organization to commit\u00a0to projects that are relevant to its\u00a0strategic positioning.\n\nPERT charts are useful input forwhat-if analyses. Understanding the\u00a0possibilities concerning the flow of project resources and milestones allows management to achieve the most efficient and useful project path.\n\nThe information that goes into a PERT chart can be highly subjective. They may include unreliable data or unreasonable estimates for cost or time.\n\nPERT charts are deadline-focused and\u00a0might not fully communicate thefinancial positioningof a project.\n\nCreating a PERT chart is labor-intensive, and maintaining and updating the information requires\u00a0additional time and resources. Continual review of the information provided, as well as the prospective positioning of the project, is required for a PERT chart to be of value.\n\nManagers can evaluate time and resources to complete project\n\nAssets required can be tracked during the course of project\n\nIncorporates data and information from all departments\n\nUseful input for what-if analyses\n\nMay include unreliable data or unreasonable estimates\n\nMay not fully communicate project's financial positioning\n\nNeeds a lot of time, labor, and project positioning\n\nTheGantt chartgoes back even further than the PERT chart. American mechanical engineer Henry Gantt designed it sometime in the second decade of the 20th century. It remains the most widely used project management chart.\n\nLike the PERT chart, the Gantt chart is a graphical depiction of a project timeline. Presented as a horizontal bar chart, it records the start and completion dates of each element of a project and indicates their interdependencies. The two charts are used in similar ways:\n\nEarly versions of the Gantt chart did not show dependencies. That is, it didn't indicate where a delay in the completion of one task could hold up the start of another task, potentially throwing a whole project off schedule. Later versions of the chart added this feature.\n\nAlthough it may be difficult to interpret, the PERT chart is often preferred to the Gantt chart as aproject managementtool because it identifies task dependencies. In some cases, project managers may use a PERT chart as part of the planning stage of a project and a Gantt chart to monitor its execution.\n\nPERT charts were first created by the U.S. Navy's Special Projects Office in the 1950s to guide the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile project. Using the PERT model, Navy project managers were able to:\n\nThe success of this initial use of PERT charts has caused them to be used ever since in many industries.\n\nA PERT chart displays all of the key deliverables necessary to complete a project. It indicates the amount of time and resources needed to perform each task and the person or department responsible for each. The key deliverables or tasks are displayed with arrows that indicate the order in which each must be completed, and the dependencies among them.\n\nMicrosoft Excelcan be used to create a PERT chart. Custom software with ready-made templates, such as Lucidchart, also are available.\n\nA PERT chart requires a project manager to think through three possible timelines: Optimistic time is the shortest possible route to completion. Pessimistic time is the longest it might take if everything goes wrong. The most likely time is a reasonable estimate of the best-case scenario.\n\nFrom the outset, the project manager has defined the ideal outcome of a project but also identified the possible barriers to achieving that outcome.\n\nProject management can be a very daunting and challenging task. But there are tools that managers can use to help make the process go a little smoother. The PERT chart can help project managers visually map out the project's timeline by highlighting all the tasks involved. It also helps managers by laying out project instructions and the timeline needed to complete each individual task. Charts can be created using specialized computer software or Microsoft Excel.\n\nSpecial Projects Office Bureau of Naval Weapons Department of the Navy. \"PERT Summary Report Phase 1.\"\n\nIndeed. \"How To Create PERT Charts in Excel (With Tips and FAQ).\"\n\nMalcolm,\u00a0D.G., et al. \"Application of a Technique for Research and Development Program Evaluation,\"Operations Research, vol. 7, no. 5, 1959, pp. 646-669.\n\nGantt Charts. \"Henry Gantt's Legacy to Management is the Gantt Chart.\"\n\nSmart Sheet. \"PERT Chart vs. Gantt Chart.\"",
