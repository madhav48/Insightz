  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nIndemnity is a comprehensive form of insurance compensation for damage or loss. When the term indemnity is used in the legal sense, it\u00a0may also refer to an exemption\u00a0from liability for damage.\n\nIndemnity is a contractual agreement between two parties. In this arrangement, one party agrees to pay for potential losses or damage.\n\nA typical example is aninsurance contract, in which the insurer\u00a0or the indemnitor agrees to compensate the other (the insured\u00a0or the indemnitee) for any damage or losses in return forpremiumspaid by the insured to the insurer. With indemnity, the insurer indemnifies the policyholder\u2014that is, promises to make whole the individual or business for any covered loss.\n\nAn indemnity clause is standard in the majority of insurance agreements. However, exactly what is covered, and to what extent, depends on the specific agreement.\n\nAny indemnity agreement has what is called aperiod of indemnity, or a specific length of time for which the payment is valid.\u00a0Similarly, many contracts include aletter of indemnity, which guarantees that both parties will meet the contract stipulations (or else\u00a0an indemnity\u00a0must be paid).\n\nIndemnity is common in agreements between an individual and a business (for example, an agreement to obtaincar insurance). However, it can also apply on a larger scale to relationships between businesses and government or between governments of two or more countries.\n\nIndemnity clauses can be complicated to negotiate and can lead to increased costs of services because of the increased risk of the contract.\n\nSometimes, governments, a business, or an entire industry must\u00a0take on the costs of larger issues on behalf of the public, such as outbreaks of disease. For example,\u00a0according to Reuters, Congress authorized $1 billion to fight a bird flu epidemic that devastated the U.S. poultry industry in 2014 and 2015. The U.S. Department of Agriculture spent $200 million of that money on indemnity payments paid to farmers who needed to kill their birds to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nIndemnity may be paid in the form of cash, or by way of repairs or replacement, depending on the terms of the indemnity agreement. For example, in the case ofhome insurance, the homeowner pays insurance premiums to the insurance company in exchange for the assurance that the homeowner will be indemnified if the house sustains damage from fire, natural disasters, or other perils specified in the insurance agreement.\n\nIn the event that the home is damaged significantly, the insurance company will be obligated\u00a0to restore the property to its original state\u2014either through repairs\u00a0by\u00a0authorized contractors\u00a0or reimbursement to the homeowner for spending on such repairs.\n\nIndemnity insuranceis a way for a company (or individual) to\u00a0obtain protection from indemnity claims. This insurance protects the holder from having to pay the full sum of an indemnity, even if the holder is responsible for the cause of the indemnity.\n\nMany companies make indemnity insurance a requirement, aslawsuitsare common. Everyday examples include malpractice insurance, which is common coverage for those in the medical field, and errors and omissions insurance\u00a0(E&O), which protects companies and their employees against claims made by clients\u00a0and applies to any given industry. Some companies also invest indeferred compensationindemnity insurance, which protects the money that companies expect to receive in the future.\n\nAs with any other form of insurance, indemnity insurance covers the costs of an indemnity claim, including, but not limited to, court costs, fees,\u00a0and settlements. The amount covered by insurance depends on the specific agreement, and the cost of the insurance depends on many factors, including the policyholder's history of indemnity claims.\n\nProperty leases also include indemnity clauses. For example, in the case of arental property, a tenant is typically responsible\u00a0for damage due to negligence, fines, lawyer fees,\u00a0and more depending on the agreement.\n\nAn act of indemnity protects those who have acted illegally from being subject to penalties. This exemption typically applies to public officers, such as police officers or government officials, who are sometimes compelled to\u00a0commit illegal acts in order to carry out the responsibilities of their jobs.\n\nOften, such protection is granted to a group of people who committed an illegal act for the common good, such as the assassination of a known dictator or terrorist leader.\n\nAlthough indemnity agreements haven't always had a formal name, they\u00a0are not a new concept. Historically, indemnity agreements have served to ensure cooperation between individuals, businesses,\u00a0and governments.\n\nIn 1825, Haiti was forced to pay France what was then called an \"independence debt.\" The payments were intended to cover the losses that French plantation owners \"suffered\" after losing land and slaves.While this form of indemnity was incredibly unjust, it is one example of many historical cases that show the ways indemnity has been applied worldwide.\n\nAnother common form of indemnity\u00a0is the reparations a winning country seeks from a losing country after a war. Depending on the amount and extent of the indemnity due, it can take years and even decades to pay off. One of the most well-known examples is the indemnity Germany paid after its role in World War I. Those\u00a0reparations were finally paid off in 2010, almost a century after they were assessed.\n\nIndemnity is a comprehensive form of insurance compensation for damage or loss. It amounts to a contractual agreement between two parties in which one party agrees to pay for potential losses or damage caused by another party.\n\nIndemnification, or indemnity, designates one party (the indemnifying party)\u00a0as being required to compensate the other party (the indemnified party) for certain costs and expenses, typically stemming from third-party damage claims.\n\nWith indemnity insurance,\u00a0one party commits to compensate another for prospective loss or damage. In insurance policies, in exchange for premiums paid by the insured to the insurer, the insurer offers to compensate the insured for any potential damage or losses.\n\nIndemnity is a type of insurance compensation paid for damage or loss. When the term is used in the legal sense, it\u00a0also may refer to an exemption\u00a0from liability for damage. Indemnity is a contractual agreement between two parties in which one party agrees to pay for potential losses or damage caused by another party. Typically, an insurance contract dictates that the insurer, also known as the indemnitor, agrees tocompensate the other partyinvolved (the insured\u00a0or the indemnitee) for any damage or losses in return for premiums paid by the insured.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin System. \"Hold Harmless and Indemnity Agreements.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Update on the Highly-Pathogenic Avian Influenza Outbreak of 2014-2015.\"\n\nReuters. \"USDA Has $80 million-$90 Million To Fight Bird Flu.\"\n\nNew York University Journal of International Law and Politics. \"France's Overdue Debt to Haiti,\" Page 1.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor. \"Germany Finishes Paying WWI Reparations, Ending Century of 'Guilt'.\"\n\nU.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. \"Timeline of Events: Treaty of Versailles Presented to German Delegation.\"\n\nThomson Reuters. \"Indemnification Clauses in Commercial Contracts.\"\n\nCornell Law School - Legal Information Institute. \"Indemnity.\"",
