  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe Conference Board's Help-Wanted Index (HWI) measures how efficiently employers are matching jobs to the available workforce (the unemployed) and is an important gauge on the economy.\n\nThe Conference Board, looking for a way to augment the portfolio of employment statistics, created the Help-Wanted Advertising Index in 1951.The most obvious contribution made by the HWI is its measure of the changes in employment demand as represented on the classified pages of newspapers, which is considered aleading indicatorof unemployment. The arguably more meaningful contribution is the HWI's indirect measure of the slack in the job market\u2014that is, how many jobs are going unfilled, or how efficient the job-matching process is.\n\nWhen the Help-Wanted Index (HWI) is rising, it means there are a relatively large amount of positions needing to be filled. This can be interpreted as a shortage of workers. Because employers may have to raise wages to attract workers, wage inflation could ensue, which could have a negative effect on bond andequity markets.\n\nCreated first in 1951, the index totaled the lines of help-wanted classified ads from 51 leading newspapers, each from a different metropolitan statistical area around the United States.\n\nThe HWI was restructured to equal 100 in 1987 and is released to the public in a monthly press release. The Conference Board releases a national number for the HWI, along with regional numbers representing nine segments of the country, and a percentage number representing the proportion of the labor market with rising want-ad volume. The current HWI report can be found on theConference Board's website.\n\nThe Conference Board is composed of a board of chairmen and trustees and its voting members. Most recently, these positions were filled by many high-ranking executives from corporations including Deutsche Bank, BBVA, Deere & Company, Johnson & Johnson, Monsanto, MasterCard, General Electric, Novartis, and State Farm Insurance.\n\nThe Conference Board. \"The New Conference Board Help Wanted OnLine (HWOL) Index is Declining.\" Accessed March 15, 2021.",
