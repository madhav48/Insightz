  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA Wilcoxon test helps researchers understand whether the outcome of e.g., an effect or activity for a particular circumstance differs between the subjects studied.\n\nThe Wilcoxon test is a nonparametric statistical hypothesis test that analyzes two paired groups to determine anysignificant statisticaldifference between them.\n\nNonparametric means that the data doesn't display a normal distribution.\n\nThe Wilcoxon test can refer to either the rank sum test or the signed-rank test version.\n\nThe rank sum and signed-rank tests were both proposed by American statistician Frank Wilcoxon in a groundbreaking research paper published in 1945.\n\nThe tests laid the foundation forhypothesis testingofnonparametric statisticswhich is used for population data that can be ranked but does not have numerical values. Such data could include customer satisfaction or music reviews.\n\nNonparametric distributions do not have parameters and cannot be defined by an equation, as parametric distributions can.\n\nThe types of questions that the Wilcoxon test can help answer include:\n\nThese models assume that the data comes from two matched, or dependent, populations. They involve the same person or stock through time or place.\n\nThe data is also assumed to be continuous as opposed to discrete. Because it is a nonparametric test, it does not require a particular probability distribution of the dependent variable in the analysis.\n\nThe Wilcoxon rank sum test can be used to test thenull hypothesisthat two populations have the same continuous distribution.\n\nA null hypothesis is a statistical test that says there's no significant difference between two populations or variables.\n\nThe base assumptions necessary to employ the rank sum test are that the data is from the same population and is paired, the data can be measured on at least an interval scale, and the data was chosen randomly and independently.\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test assumes that there is information in the magnitudes and signs of the differences between paired observations.\n\nAs the nonparametric equivalent of the paired student's t-test, the signed-rank can be used as an alternative to thet-testwhen the population data does not follow anormal distribution.\n\nThe steps for arriving at a Wilcoxon signed-rank test statistic,W,are as follows:\n\nIn practice, this test is performed using statistical analysis software or a spreadsheet.\n\nThe Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to compare two related samples or to check the difference in multiple measurements of the same sample to determine whether there exists a difference in their population mean ranks. The overall task is to see if there is a difference between two sets of related data and whether those differences are meaningful or just chance.\n\nLike the Wilcoxon test, the t-test is used to determine if there is a meaningful difference between two related samples. T-tests are used when there is a normal distribution and the data variances are unknown. Certain assumptions need to be made when using a t-test.\n\nAs a t-test calls for certain assumptions, or requirements, the Wilcoxon test is used when these assumptions cannot be met. For example, when your data is not normally distributed, (normal distribution is needed in a t-test), then you would use a Wilcoxon test.\n\nThe Wilcoxon test is a statistical tool for analyzing paired data when the traditional parametric assumptions cannot be met.\n\nIt examines the differences and ranks between the pairs to determine whether they have a statistically significant difference. Either the rank sum or signed-rank tests can be used.\n\nWilcoxon, Frank. \"Individual Comparisons by Ranking Methods.\"International Biometric Society,vol. 1, no. 6, December 1945, pp. 80-83.",
