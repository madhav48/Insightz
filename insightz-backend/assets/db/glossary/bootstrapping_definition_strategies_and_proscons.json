  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe term bootstrapping refers to a situation in which anentrepreneurstarts a company with little capital. When an individual bootstraps, they rely on money other than outside investments. An individual is said to bootstrap when they attempt to establish and build a company from personal finances or the operating revenues of the new company. Bootstrapping also describes a procedure used to calculate the zero-couponyield curvefrom market figures.\n\nBootstrapping a company occurs when a business owner starts a company from the ground up. This means that the owner establishes their business with little to no assets. Founders typically rely on personal savings,sweat equity, lean operations, quick inventory turnover, and a cash runway to become successful. For example, a bootstrapped company may take preorders for its product, thereby using the funds generated from the orders actually to build and deliver the product itself.\n\nCompared to usingventure capital, bootstrapping can be beneficial because the entrepreneur can maintain control over all decisions. On thedownside, this form of financing may place unnecessaryfinancial riskon the entrepreneur. Furthermore, bootstrapping may not provide enough investment for the company to become successful at a reasonable rate.\n\nBootstrapping is contrasted with starting a company by raising capital throughangel investorsor venture capital firms. Individuals who use these means to start their businesses typically have a proven track record or anidea that others may find profitableand promising, with the potential for large returns.\n\nIn investment finance, bootstrapping is a method that builds aspot rate curvefor a zero-coupon bond.This methodology is essentially used to fill in the gaps between yields for Treasury securities or Treasury coupon strips.\n\nFor example, since the T-bills offered by the government are not available for every period, the bootstrapping method is used to fill in the missing figures to derive the yield curve. The bootstrap method usesinterpolationto determine the yields for Treasury zero-coupon securities with various maturities.\n\nThere are a few steps that entrepreneurs can follow in order to bootstrap a business. We highlight them in this section below.\n\nBefore bootstrapping theirstartupcompany, business owners should first assess whether bootstrapping makes sense for their operations. It may not be financially feasible to bootstrap a company that requires high upfront capital investments to form.\n\nSome businesses may also have a slower turnaround of inventory, meaning bootstrapped cash may be tied up for a longer period.\n\nIf bootstrapping makes sense, an early step for a business owner is to form a business plan. Thisbusiness planshould include a financial budget that outlines the expected cash inflows and outflows for the next few years.\n\nA business owner may decide that at different stages of company growth, a varying amount of capital needs to be bootstrapped.\n\nA critical aspect of the bootstrapping plan is to determine how revenue will be cycled through a company. For example, during the start-up phase, 100% of operations may be funded by bootstrapped cash until the company earnsrevenuefrom customers.\n\nAn owner should decide upfront how that revenue will be used, such as to channel business growth or toreimbursethe owner. The main risk is extracting cash too soon, not fully developing the company, and leaving both the company and owner at risk of loss.\n\nTo bootstrap, an owner needs to decide where resources will come from and what options of bootstrapping they want to pursue. For example, the owner may decide to use their:\n\nThey may also choose to adjust business practices to accommodate the growth period.\n\nThe business owner must be mindful that each of these options has detriments. For instance, capital may be lost, time cannot be recovered, and limited business may stunt company growth.\n\nBootstrapping is often the stage of a company where the big business idea has been created but the underlying resources to foster the idea aren't available yet.\n\nNot all bootstrapped operations employ the same strategies. There are different opportunities that startups can use to temporarily get the resources they need until operations are more robust. Here are some of the more common bootstrapping strategies.\n\nA company often needs upfront capital in the initial stages. One of the most common forms of bootstrapping is for the business founder to contribute personal capital as an initial financial investment into the company.\n\nDepending on the industry and business operating strategy, a founder must sometimes supply capital at various stages during the early days of a company.\n\nIf an owner or founder doesn't have enough capital on hand, they may decide to take out personal loans to finance the company. The company likely can't receive a loan (or receive nearly as favorable loan terms) because it does not have the same established financial history as the founder.\n\nBecause this bootstrapping method results in personal debt, the owner is personally liable and may have personal assets seized should they gobankruptand default on the loan.\n\nThe owner may bootstrap during the early days of the company by limiting spending. For example, the owner may personally deliver goods to customers in their local area instead of paying extra for delivery services.\n\nIn this bootstrapping strategy, the owner is not limited to what is done. Rather, it is limiting how things are done. Most often, this strategy results in a trade between capital and time. This means the owner is willing to sacrifice their time as capital may be low.\n\nA company may also decide to pull in third parties or other investors to help with thefinancingof the operations. Though this is often a more permanent, long-term investment, sometimes owners rely on short-term agreements to temporarily finance the business.\n\nFor example, athird partymay buy stock or issue debt to earn a short-term return. Though this agreement puts the third party at risk, it is less of a risk than a long-term investment without defined payback orliquidationterms.\n\nCompanies often bootstrap by temporarily limiting what the business can do. For instance, it may only:\n\nA founder must be strategic in the benchmarks it hopes to achieve before unlocking other aspects of the business operations.\n\nBootstrapping is not required to start a business. A founder may accumulate resources before starting their company to have its needs meet from the company's first day.\n\nBootstrapping often allows an owner to retain control over the company. Though one of the options is to pursue short-term financing from a third party, most forms of bootstrapping rely on just the owner's resources. This means the owner doesn't need to sacrifice long-term flexibility due to short-term constraints.\n\nThis strategy may lead to greater short-term profitability as the owner is hyper-conscious of costs. For example, the owner may intentionally avoid costs in the short term, though these expenses like software andinfrastructureare necessary in the long term.\n\nAn owner usually also has a lowerbarrier of entryinto an industry when they bootstrap as an owner may not have all of the capital needed upfront. Instead, the owner can slowly build resources through resourcefulness and deliberate actions relating to the business.\n\nNot all aspects of bootstrapping are great, especially in the long term. Because the financing of the company may not be 100% secured, there is an increasedriskthat the business may fail, especially if a large unforeseen expense arises. As there are many areas a company may fall short, such as a supplier not following through or equipment breaking, a company may find it needs capital sooner than it may originally expect.\n\nBy definition, bootstrapping means that a company operates with limited resources. This may prohibit how much a company can reinvest into the company as opposed to paying back the owner. The owner simultaneously tries to raise business for the company and return its capital, both of which compete for the same capital.\n\nAnother pitfall is that a company may face short-term branding and image issues. Consider a company that self-delivers its products by driving around town. Since this is untraditional, some prospective buyers may feel it demonstrates the small scope of the operations. Investors and suppliers may resist interacting with the company due to the heightened risk of interacting with an immature company.\n\nMay give an owner greater control of the company\n\nCost avoidance measures help reduce business expenses\n\nPlaces a heightened emphasis on business operations\n\nIncreases financial risk as a company may not be able to cover emergency or unexpected costs\n\nRequires a company to operate with limited resources\n\nMay diminish how customers, suppliers, or investors view the company\n\nMany companies start with humble beginnings and limited resources. One example isJeff Bezos'personal software development for Amazon (AMZN), which operated out of his garage with just a handful of employees when it sold its first book in 1995.\n\nOther founders take even more nontraditional routes to finance their companies. GoPro founder Nick Woodman reportedly borrowed $35,000 from his mother and went as far as to use her sewing machine to craft early designs of GoPro devices.\n\nA more popular and sensationalized means of bootstrapping was Meta's (META)humble beginnings.Mark Zuckerberglaunched the social media site in 2004 from his college dorm room.\n\nBootstrapping earned its term in the 1800s based on the phrase pull oneself up by one's bootstraps (or other slight variations). The saying was a reference to doing difficult things by tugging on the ankle straps of high-top boots. The phrase has continued to be used to reference any undertaking that may require extra effort because it is difficult.\n\nBootstrapping is not necessarily bad. If a business owner doesn't have all the resources it needs on the first day of operations, they may need to take special considerations to make sure the business needs are met. Many successful businesses have bootstrapped during its infancy and though some may negatively view the process, others may find charm in bootstrapping and have greater respect for these types of companies.\n\nThe idea behind bootstrapping is to temporarily find solutions to meet business needs until more permanent solutions are possible. It is usually not in the best interest of the company to permanently bootstrap as this exposes a company to higher financial risk than necessary. Bootstrapping may also be taxing to the owner who often prefers to have a more stable, scalable strategy to develop their company.\n\nThe best-case scenario for many new companies is to have all of the resources it needs on their first. Unfortunately, that's usually not how things go. Businesses must often bootstrap or temporarily come up with creative, resourceful solutions to make sure their business needs are being met. Whether relying on personal capital, cutting costs, or limiting business operations, owners have an array of strategies to bootstrap but also face a number of potential downsides.\n\nAnnaert, Jan and et al. \"Estimating the Yield Curve Using the Nelson\u2010Siegel Model.\"Universiteit Antwerpen, pp. 1-37.\n\nBrad Stone. \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" Chapter 2.
