A tombstone is one component of the disclosure requirements for security offerings required by theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC).The tombstone is simply an announcement that securities are available for sale.\n\nWhile a tombstone ad is just a brief announcement alerting investors to the upcoming security sale, aprospectusgoes into greater detail and gives investors the information they need to make an investing decision. When a company issues securities to the public, the SEC requires that each investor receive a prospectus. The prospectus requirement applies to aninitial public offering(IPO), which refers to the first time an issuer sells any type of security to the general public.\n\nThe prospectus requirement also applies to allseasoned issues, A seasoned issue, also known as a secondary offering, is when an established company that already trades on the stock exchange issues new shares of stock for sale. A tombstone for a secondary offering is mailed to all investors who already own the security, and all secondary offerings are sold using a prospectus.\n\nThe preliminary prospectus doesn't include price information, but is used to gauge market interest in the security being proposed; the final prospectus, however, includes price information as well as the number of shares the company will sell.\n\nAn underwriter is responsible for managing the legal and accounting process of creating a prospectus. The prospectus includes the issuer's most recent set of auditedfinancial statements, as well as a legal opinion regarding the existence of any pending legal matters.\n\nA prospectus goes into great detail about a\u00a0firm's marketing, production, and sales process, and it explains why the company is raising more capital.

The tombstone lists the syndicate members who are involved in the underwriting of the security, with the primary members listed in larger type at the top of the advertisement.\n\nA syndicate member's level of involvement is based on the work the member performs on the security offering and the percentage of the total issue that the member's firm sells to the public. If a syndicate member is listed at the top of a tombstone for a popular issuer of stock, that document helps the syndicate firm market its expertise to other companies.",
