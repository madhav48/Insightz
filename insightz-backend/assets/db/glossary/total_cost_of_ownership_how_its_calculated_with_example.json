  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe total cost of ownership (TCO) is thepurchase priceof anassetcombined with the ongoing costs of operation. Assessing the TCO means examining the product's overall value over time.\n\nWhen choosing among alternatives in a purchasing decision, buyers often look at an item\u2019s short-term price, known as its purchase price. However they should also consider its long-term price, which is its total cost of ownership. These are the long-term costs and expenses incurred during the product\u2019s useful life and ultimate disposal. The item with the lower total cost of ownership can be the better value in thelong run.\n\nCompanies and individuals consider the total cost of ownership when buying assets and investing\u00a0incapital projects. For a business, the cost of purchase, operations, and maintenance are often itemized separately on financial statements. The former is booked as acapital expenditure, while the latter is part of operating expenditures.\u00a0A comprehensive analysis of the cost of ownership is a common practice for businesses.\n\nCompanies use total cost of ownership over the long term as a framework for analyzing business deals. Looking at total cost of ownership is a way of taking a more holistic approach that assesses the purchase from a broad perspective. This analysis includes the initial purchase price as well as all direct and indirect expenses.\n\nWhiledirect expensescan be easily reported, companies most often seek to analyze all potential indirect expenses that can significantly influence whether to complete a purchase.\n\nThe total cost of ownership looks at the cost of owning an asset over the long term, by assessing both its purchase price and the costs of operation.\n\nLet\u2019s say a company is considering investing in a new computer system. While the initial purchase price of the system is an obvious consideration, TCO would also take into account:\n\nThis comprehensive view helps the company assess whether the computer system\u2019s long-term benefits outweigh its total costs.\n\nFor individuals, TCO can also influence purchasing decisions. For instance, a car\u2019s total cost of ownership includes the purchase price and expenses like repairs, fuel, and insurance.\n\nThe purchase of a car is one example where cost comparison matters. Total cost of ownership of a car is not just the purchase price but also the expenses incurred through its use, such as repairs, insurance, and fuel.\n\nThe total cost of ownership analysis can be especially important when comparing a used car to a new car. A used car that appears to be a great bargain actually might have a total cost of ownership that is higher than that of a new car if the used car requires numerous repairs, while the new car has a three-year warranty\u00a0that could cover repair charges.\n\nIn the automotive industry, leading consumer resourceKelley Blue Bookprovides buyers with details on total cost of ownership. This industry analysis is provided for various vehicles and includes a variety of expenses, such as fuel, insurance, repairs, anddepreciation.\n\nThe components of TCO depend on the item but should always include the initial purchase price, costs associated with operating the item, ongoing maintenance, training needed, and how long the item is expected to last before replacement is needed.\n\nConsidering TCO is important before purchasing any item, especially larger purchases. Cars, homes, and other major purchases should have a TCO analysis. For businesses, a TCO analysis could apply to new technology or equipment needed for the job.\n\nAny information source about the operating costs of an item will be helpful. Consumer Reports is a good source for many items, including technology and automobiles. Resources like Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds are good sources for information about auto purchases.\n\nTotal cost of ownership is an important consideration for both businesses and individuals. When making a major purchase, don't just look at the upfront price\u2014be sure to factor in long-term costs like maintenance, repairs, and energy consumption. A comprehensive TCO analysis ensures you\u2019re making an informed decision, whether it\u2019s for a business investment or a personal purchase.\n\nBureau of Transportation Statistics. \"Average Cost of Owning and Operating and Automobile.\"\n\nKelley Blue Book. \"Kelley Blue Book.\"",
