  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA revocable trust is a flexible estate planning tool that allows the grantor to alter or cancel its provisions during their lifetime while bypassing probate in the event of the grantor's death.\n\nA revocabletrustis a living trust with terms that can be changed or even undone entirely by itsgrantor, the individual who created it and funded it with assets to pass on to beneficiaries. Income earned by the assets is distributed to the grantor until their time of death. The property held in the trust doesn't transfer to thebeneficiaries of the trustuntil after the grantor's death.\n\nA revocable trust can be a helpful estate planning tool because it provides flexibility and income to the living grantor, also called thetrustor.\n\nArevocable trustis anestate-planningoption that manages the assets of the grantor as they age. It can be amended or revoked if the grantor desires. The property it holds is included in the grantor's estate forestate taxpurposes.\n\nAtrusteemight be assigned to manage the assets or property within the trust or the grantor can act as trustee during their lifetime, naming a successor trustee to take over and disburse the trust after their death. This is quite unlike an irrevocable trust. The successor trustee is charged with distributing the assets to the beneficiaries. The trustbecomes irrevocableupon the grantor\u2019s death.\n\nThe money or property held by the trustee for the benefit of someone else is referred to as the trust's principal. The value of the principal can change due to the trustee\u2019s expenses or an investment\u2019s appreciation or depreciation in the financial markets. The collective assets make up thetrust fund. Those benefiting from the trust are the beneficiaries. A revocable trust holds the assets and it doesn't die so the trust avoidsprobate, the legal process of distributing assets of awill.\n\nAll trusts are either revocable and can be changed by the grantor or they're irrevocable, fixed trusts that can't be changed after they're established.\n\nThere are several advantages of establishing a revocable trust. It can allow the grantor\u2019s chosen successor to step in and take control of the principal if the grantor experiences health concerns through the aging process.\n\nAncillary probate of real estate that the trust holds is avoided if the grantor ownsreal estateoutside the state of the grantor'sdomicileand the real estate is included in the trust.\n\nA minor beneficiary\u2019s assets can be held in the trust rather than having the court appoint a guardian if the beneficiary isn't of legal age and can't yet hold property. The trust allows a set amount of money to be distributed regularly and incrementally if the grantor believes a beneficiary won't use the assets wisely.\n\nAdministration of these trusts is quite easy. They're disregarded entities for income tax purposes. Taxes deriving from any assets held in the trust are assigned to their grantors during their lifetimes.\n\nThere are some disadvantages to revocable trusts, too, however. Implementing a revocable trust involves much time and effort. Assets must be retitled in the name of the trust to avoid probate. The grantor\u2019s entire estate plan must bemonitored annuallyto ensure that the trust\u2019s objectives are being met.\n\nThe costs of maintaining a revocable trust are greater than other estate planning tools. A revocable trust doesn't offer the grantor any estate tax advantages. It's possible that not all of a grantor's assets will be included in their revocable trust so the grantor would have to also create a will to designate beneficiaries for the remaining assets and these would have to pass through the probate process. Creditors can still reach the property in a revocable trust during the grantor's lifetime.\n\nProtection if trustor becomes incapacitated\n\nCan be expensive to establish and administer\n\nAliving trustis one that's established during an individual's lifetime. It can be either revocable or irrevocable. A revocable living trust is often used in estate planning to avoid probate court and fights over the assets of an estate. A revocable living trust doesn't confer tax or creditor protection, unlike an irrevocable trust.\n\nRevocable and Irrevocable trusts are used for different purposes. A revocable trust can be undone and dissolved by the grantor if it no longer serves the grantor's needs. An irrevocable trust can't be changed or altered once it's established. The trust becomes a legal entity that owns the assets it holds.\n\nThe trustor no longer controls or owns these assets so there are certain tax advantages and creditor protections. Irrevocable trusts are best used for transferring high-value assets that could cause gift or estate tax issues in the future.\n\nA revocable trust automatically converts into an irrevocable trust when the grantor dies.\n\nYes, you can. As of April 1, 2024, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)issued final regulations that alter how bank accounts held in the name of a trust will be insured as of April 1, 2024.\n\nThe regulations effectively treat revocable and irrevocable trusts the same in terms of determining the insurance limits, combining them into a single category called \"trust accounts.\" Funds in a bank for a trust are insured up to $250,000 per beneficiary per FDIC-insured bank up to a maximum of five eligible beneficiaries, or $1.25 million. An eligible beneficiary can be any living person or a charity or nonprofit recognized by the IRS.\n\nA trust owner with three eligible primary (not contingent) beneficiaries is insured up to $750,000.\n\nA revocable trust is created during your lifetime and can help you manage your assets as well as protect you if you become ill or disabled. Its advantage over an irrevocable trust is that you can revoke or amend it whenever you like provided that you're of sound mind. A revocable trust will also help your heirs avoid probate but it won't avoid estate tax.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"What Is a Revocable Living Trust?\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"New Trust Account Rule (April 2024) Deposit Insurance Seminar for Bankers.\" Pages 6-8.",
