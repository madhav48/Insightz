  "term": "Wealth Management Meaning and What Wealth Managers Charge",
  "definition": "Wealth management is an investment advisory service that uses financial services to address the needs of affluent clients.\n\nUsing a consultative process, the advisor gleans information about a client\u2019s wants and specific situation. They then tailor a personalized strategy that uses a range of financial products and services to help the client achieve their goals.\n\nWealth management often takes a comprehensive approach. That is, to meet the complex needs of an affluent client, a broad range of services\u2014such as money management, financial planning, investment advice, estate planning, accounting, life insurance, retirement, and tax services\u2014may be provided.\n\nWhile fee structures vary across comprehensive wealth management services, typically, fees are based on a client\u2019s assets under management (AUM).\n\nWealth management is more than just investment advice. It can encompass all parts of a person\u2019s financial life.\n\nInstead of receiving advice and various products from multiple professionals,high-net-worth individualsmay be more likely to benefit from an integrated approach, where all services come from or are managed by a single source.\n\nIn this approach, a wealth manager coordinates the various services needed to handle their clients\u2019 assets. They will create a strategic plan for their current and future needs. Those needs may include will and trust services,business succession planning, wealth transfer, and more.\n\nSome wealth managers provide services in any aspect of the financial field while others choose to specialize in particular areas, such as cross-border wealth management. This specialization may be based on the expertise of a particular manager or the primary focus of a wealth management firm.\n\nIn certain instances, an advisor may coordinate input from outside financial experts, as well as from the client\u2019s own service professionals (for example, an attorney or accountant) to craft the optimal strategy to benefit the client. Some managers also provide banking services or advice onphilanthropic activities.\n\nGenerally speaking, wealth management offices employ experts and professionals in different fields. For instance, consider a client who has $10 million in investable assets\u2014in addition toa trust for their grandchildren\u2014and a partner who has recently passed away.\n\nSuch an office would not only invest these funds in a discretionary account but also provide will and trust services required for tax minimization and estate planning.\n\nAfamily officeis a type of private wealth management firm that handles these needs and much more for ultra-high-net-worth clients. For example, its staff may also provide budgeting assistance, money education services, and concierge services for non-financial needs (such as household management, schooling, and travel).\n\nWealth managers may work as part of either a small-scale business or a larger firm, one generally associated with the financial industry. Depending on the business, wealth managers may function under different titles, includingfinancial consultantsor financial advisors.\n\nA client may receive services from a single designated wealth manager or may have access to the members of a specified wealth management team.\n\nAdvisors in the direct employ of an investment firm may have more knowledge of investment strategies, while those who work for a large bank may focus on the management of trusts and available credit options, overall estate planning, or insurance options.\u00a0In short, expertise may vary across different firms.\n\nNewer, fully-automatedroboadvisorplatforms intended as wealth management tools for ordinary individuals often charge far less than 1% per year of AUM and come with low minimum account balances to get started.\n\nWealth managers cancharge for their servicesin several ways. Some work as fee-only advisors and charge an annual, hourly, or flat fee. Some work on commission and are paid through the investments that they sell.\n\nFee-based advisors earn a combination of a fee plus commissions on the investment products that they sell.\n\nA survey of financial advisors found that the median advisory fee (up to $1 millionAUM) is just around 1%. However, some advisors charge more, especially on smaller account balances. Individuals with larger balances can often pay substantially less, with the median AUM fee declining as assets increase.\n\nCheck the credentials of a professional of interest for an idea of their designation and training. You want to select someone who best suits your needs and situation.\n\nThe top threeprofessional advisor credentialsare Certified Financial Planner, Chartered Financial Analyst, and Personal Financial Specialist. Many websites for professional certifying organizations allow you to vet if a member is in good standing or has had disciplinary actions or complaints.\n\nTheFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)has a tool that explains professional designations. You can also see whether the issuing organization requires continuing education, takes complaints, or has a way for you to confirm who holds the credentials.\n\nAccording to Indeed, the average salary for a wealth manager in the United States was approximately $132,000 in 2024.\n\nWhile some professionals are both wealth managers and financial planners, a key difference betweenfinancial planners and wealth managersis that the latter are focused on assets and investments, while planners also consider everyday household finances, insurance needs, and so on.\n\nAs of 2024, it is estimated that the industry had assets under management of over $128.9 trillion globally. This figure is expected to grow to $145.4 trillion by 2025.\n\nA wealth manager starts by developing a plan that will maintain and/or increase a client\u2019s wealth based on their financial situation, goals, andrisk tolerance.\n\nEach part of a client\u2019s financial picture, whether it'stax planningor wills and estates, is coordinated by a wealth manager to protect the wealth of the client and help them achieve their goals.\n\nA wealth manager meets regularly with clients to update goals and rebalance the financial portfolio. At the same time, they may investigate whether additional services are needed. The ultimate goal is to remain in the client\u2019s service throughout their lifetime.\n\nAdvisory HQ News Corp. \"What Are the Average Financial Advisor Fees & Investment Fees Being Charged in 2023?\"\n\nAmerican Institute of CPAs. \"Disciplinary Actions.\"\n\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards. \"Verify an Individual\u2019s CFP Certification and Background.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Professional Designations.\"\n\nStatista. \"Wealth Management - Worldwide.\"\n\nPrice Waterhouse Cooper. \"Global Assets under Management set to rise to $145.4 trillion by 2025.\"",
