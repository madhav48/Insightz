  "term": "What Is Cost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF)?",
  "definition": "CIF is one of many international commerce terms\u00a0known as\u00a0Incoterms, the common trade rules developed by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC).\n\nCost, Insurance, and Freight (CIF) ensures the seller covers the costs, insurance, and freight of a buyer's order when cargo is transported via a waterway, sea, or ocean.\n\nWhen goods are loaded onto the vessel, the risk of loss or damage is transferred from the seller to the buyer. However,insurancefor the cargo and paying for freight remain the seller's responsibility.\n\nThe contract terms of CIF define when theliabilityof the seller ends and the liability of the buyer begins. CIF is only used when shipping goods overseas or via a waterway.\n\nThe seller has the responsibility for paying the cost and freight of shipping the goods to the buyer's port of destination. Usually, exporters who have direct access to ships will use CIF. However, the buyer has responsibilities as well, which are outlined below.\n\nUnder CIF terms, the seller's\u00a0responsibilities include:\n\nThe seller must deliver the goods to the ship within the agreed-upon timeframe and provide proof of delivery and loading.\n\nOnce the goods have arrived at the buyer's destination port, the buyer assumes responsibility for the costs associated with importing and delivering the goods. Some of these costs include the following:\n\nIt's important to note that when shipping internationally, there can be different risk and cost transfer points between the buyer and seller, depending on the type of shipping agreement. Under CIF, the risk transfer is at a different point than the cost transfer. The exact details of the contract will determine when the liability for the goods transfers from the seller to the buyer.\n\nSince the seller pays the shipping, freight, and insurance costs until the cargo arrives at the buyer's destination port, the cost transfer occurs when the goods arrive at the buyer's port. However, the risk transfer occurs from the seller to the buyer when the goods have been loaded on the vessel. Although the seller must purchase insurance, the buyer has ownership of the goods once loaded onto the ship, and if the goods have been damaged during transit, the buyer must file a claim with the seller's insurance company.\n\nSince the buyer assumes the risk only when the cargo has been loaded on the vessel, certain situations may not be suitable for a CIF agreement. For example, with containerized cargo shipments, the goods may sit in a container for days before being loaded onto the vessel at the seller's port. Under CIF, the buyer would be at risk since the goods would not be insured while they sit in the container waiting to be loaded on the vessel. As a result, CIF agreements would not be appropriate for shipments, including containerized cargo.\n\nCIF is different from cost and freight provision (CFR) whereby sellers are not required to insure goods in transit.\n\nCIF is one of the international commerce terms\u00a0known asIncoterms. Incoterms are common trade rules developed by theInternational Chamber of Commerce (ICC)in 1936.The ICC established these terms to govern the shipping policies and responsibilities of\u00a0buyers and sellers who engage in international trade.\u00a0Incoterms\u00a0are often similar to domestic terms (such as the U.S. Uniform Commercial Code) but with international applications.\n\nFor example, the parties to a contract must state the locale of the governing law for their terms. The ICC limits the use of CIF when transporting goods to only those that move via inland waterways or by sea. The ICC's\u00a0official definition of CIF\u00a0reads:\n\nOver the years, the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has made changes to the terms and guidelines for international trade. In 2020, the ICC made adjustments to the rules, (called Incoterms 2020), which in part, made changes to security requirements for shipments.\n\nIncoterms 2020 also made changes to the insurance coverage requirements under CIF agreements. Sellers are now required to obtain a higher level or more comprehensive insurance than what was required under Incoterms 2010.\n\nThere are seven Incoterms 2020 rules for any type of transport and four Incoterms rules for sea and inland waterway transports.\n\nCost, insurance, and freight (CIF) andFree on Board (FOB)are both international shipping agreements, but have distinct differences between them. Each type of contract will cover different circumstances, and much depends on your experience with international trade.\n\nCIF is an international agreement between a buyer and seller in which the seller has responsibility for the cost, insurance, and freight of a sea or waterway shipment. Although the possession of the shipment transfers to the buyer once the goods have been loaded on the boat or ship, the seller is responsible for any shipping insurance andfreight charges.\n\nAs a result, the seller is responsible for the costs of moving the shipment until the goods have arrived at the buyer's destination port. Some of these costs include fees for shipping, export customs clearance, duty, and taxes.\n\nOnce the goods have been delivered to the buyer's destination port, the buyer must pay the agreed price for the goods and is responsible for any import fees, taxes, or custom duty charges. Also, any transportation, inspection, and licensing costs, as well as the cost to transport the goods to their final location, are the buyer's responsibility.\n\nFree on Board means the seller has the responsibility for delivering and loading the product onto the ship, including any costs associated with that process. However, the responsibilities transfer to the buyer once the goods have been loaded onto the ship.\n\nThe seller has the following responsibilities under FOB:\n\nUnder FOB, the buyer has the following responsibilities:\n\nIt's important to note that there are different types of FOB agreements and the insurance coverage can be negotiated between the buyer and seller. In other words, there could be an agreement in which the buyer pays the freight charges or cost of delivery but the seller might agree to pay for the marine insurance.\n\nCIF and FOB are helpful since these shipping agreements outline whether the buyer or seller has the responsibility for the freight during the shipment. These terms are important since they indicate which parties are responsible for insurance, freight charges, and which party is held responsible in the event the goods are damaged during transport.\n\nAs an example, let's say that Best Buy has ordered 1,000 flat-screen televisions from Sony using a CIF agreement to Kobe, a Japanese port. Sony has delivered the order to the port and loaded the product onto the ship for transport. Once loading has been completed, the risk of loss is transferred from Sony to Best Buy. In return, Sony has purchased insurance and pays the freight and shipping costs until the ordered goods reach the buyer's port of destination.\n\nWhile the ship is en route, a fire breaks out in one of the cargo bays. The cargo is damaged due to the fire and the water during fire fighting efforts. Since a CIF agreement was in place, Best Buy can file an insurance claim to cover the cost of the damaged goods.\n\nCost, insurance, and freight (CIF) is an international shipping agreement used when freight is shipped via sea or waterway. Under CIF, the seller is responsible for covering the costs, insurance, and freight of the buyer's shipment while in transit. The buyer is responsible for any costs once the freight has reached the buyer's destination port.\n\nThe seller must pay for the costs of transferring and shipping the freight as well as insuring the cargo until the goods have been delivered to the buyer's port.\n\nDuty charges for exporting the goods from the seller's port of destination are the responsibility of the seller. However, duty charges at the buyer's port of destination (import duties) are the responsibility of the buyer.\n\nCIF is only used when shipping goods via ocean or waterway, meaning CIF cannot be used for air freight. CIF can be easier for buyers who don't want to go through the trouble of obtaining insurance, paying freight charges, and assuming all of the responsibility for shipping internationally.\n\nCost, insurance, and freight (CIF) is an international shipping term that describes the seller's responsibility for the cost of shipping, freight charges, and insuring the cargo being shipped via ocean or waterway. CIF means that the seller is responsible for the costs of transporting the cargo and obtaining insurance to protect the buyer from any damages to the goods during transport. However, the buyer assumes responsibility for the goods once the cargo has reached the buyer's port.\n\nCIF is different fromcost and freight (CFR), which is when the seller is responsible for the shipping and freight costs, but under CFR, the seller is not responsible for obtaining marine insurance. There are various types of international shipping agreements, including cost, insurance, and freight (CIF), free on board (FOB), and cost and freight (CFR). As a result, it's important that buyers and sellers understand all of the legal terms within these agreements before engaging in international trade.\n\nCorrection: April 30, 2023\u2014An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that ownership transfers from the seller to the buyer when the goods reach the destination port. In fact, ownership transfers at the point that the goods are loaded on the ship.\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms 2010.\"\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms Rules.\"\n\nTrade Finance Global. \"Incoterms\u00ae 2020 \u2013 7 Key Changes You Need to Know [Update].\"\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms 2020.\"\n\nTrade.gov. \"Know Your Incoterms.\"",
