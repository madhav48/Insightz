As such, the core principle of structured finance is securitization of assets and asset pools.\n\nStructured financial products are typically not offered by traditional lenders. Generally, because structured finance is required for majorcapitalinjection into a business or organization, investors are required to provide such financing. Structured financial products are almost always nontransferable, meaning that they cannot be shifted between various types of debt in the same way that a standard loan can.\n\nIncreasingly, structured financing andsecuritizationare used by corporations, governments, and financial intermediaries to manage risk, develop financial markets, expand business reach, and design new funding instruments for advancing, evolving, and complex emerging markets.

Various tiers of these repackaged instruments are then sold to investors. Securitization promotesliquidityand is used to develop the structured financial products used by qualified businesses and other customers. There are many benefits of securitization, including being a less expensive source of funding and better use of capital.\n\nMortgage-backed securities (MBSs)are a model example of securitization\u00a0and its risk-transferring utility. Mortgages may be grouped into one large pool, leaving the issuer the opportunity to divide the pool into pieces that are based on the risk of default inherent to each mortgage. The smaller pieces may then be sold to investors.\n\nStructured finance most often involves one or several discretionary transactions to be completed.
