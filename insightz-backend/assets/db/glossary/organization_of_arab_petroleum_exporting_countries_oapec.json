OAPEC\u00a0fosters cooperation among its 11-member Arab oil-exporting nations.\n\nOAPEC was established in 1968 by Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. Its other members include\u00a0Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Qatar, Syria, Tunisia, and the United Arab Emirates. Although they have several members in common, OAPEC is a separate and distinct entity fromOPEC(the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries), the 13-nationcartelthat plays a pivotal role\u00a0in determining global petroleum prices.\n\nOAPEC\u00a0sponsors joint ventures for its member countries to promote the effective use of resources and the economic integration of Arab countries.\n\nKuwait, Libya and Saudi Arabia signed an agreement in Beirut on January 9, 1968, establishing OAPEC, and agreeing that the organization would be located in the State of Kuwait.\u00a0By 1982, the number of members had increased to 11.\u00a0In 1986, Tunisia submitted a request for withdrawal and it was accepted by the Ministerial Council.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOAPEC's structure is composed of the Ministerial Council, General Secretariat, and a Judicial Tribunal. The Ministerial Council\u00a0is managed by a Council of Ministers, which is responsible for general policy, activities, and governance.\u00a0The Council grants membership to applying countries and approves invitations to meetings that are extended to petroleum exporting countries.\n\nThe Council also adopts resolutions and advises on issues, approves\u00a0the draft annual budgets of the General Secretariat and the Judicial Tribunal,\u00a0validates the end-of-year accounts\u00a0and appoints\u00a0the Secretary-General and Assistant Secretaries.\n\nThe Executive Bureau\u00a0supervises\u00a0the organization in conjunction with the Ministerial Council. The Executive Bureau\u00a0prepares the Council\u2019s agenda, amends\u00a0the regulations applicable to the staff of the General Secretariat, reviews the organization's budget\u00a0and comments on Council issues that are related to the Articles of Agreement. The Executive Bureau has one representative from each member country.\n\nThe General Secretariat manages the organization\u2019s activities according to\u00a0the objectives outlined in the stated in the original OAPEC agreement and the\u00a0directives of the Ministerial Council.\u00a0The Secretary-General heads the Secretariat and is the organization's official spokesman and legal representative.\n\nThe Judicial Tribunal was established by a special Protocol signed on May 9, 1978, in Kuwait.\u00a0The Protocol was added\u00a0to the organization\u2019s Agreement and became effective on April 20, 1980.\u00a0The first Judges of the Tribunal were elected on May 6, 1981. The protocol mandates that there must be an\u00a0uneven number of judges of Arab citizenship (a minimum of seven and a maximum of eleven).\n\nAccording to Gulf News, although momentum is not at the pace it was 30 years ago, OAPEC\u00a0has had a substantial positive influence on the Arab oil and gas industry since its inception.\u00a0Arab energy and oil consumption has increased 15-fold and 10-fold, respectively, and\u00a0oil reserves have increased to 710 billion barrels in 2016 from less than half that number in 1980.\n\nIn addition, gas reserves grew from 15 to 53 trillion cubic meters, and Arab petrochemicals production has now exceeded 150 million tons a year.Historically, it is worth noting that reserve data from OAPEC is influenced by the data provided by member nations, and the accuracy of that data varies.\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"History - The Definition of the Organization.\"\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"Member Countries.\"\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"History - The Definition of the Organization.\"\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"Ministerial Council.\"\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"The Executive Bureau.\"\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"The General Secretariat.\"\n\nOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. \"The Judicial Tribunal.\"\n\nGulf News. \"Arab Oil Grouping Could Have Done a Lot More.\"",
