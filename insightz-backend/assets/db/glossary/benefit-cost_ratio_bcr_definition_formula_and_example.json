  "definition": "The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is a ratio used in acost-benefit analysisto summarize the overall relationship between the relative costs and benefits of a proposed project.\n\nBCR can be expressed in monetary or qualitative terms. If a project has a BCR greater than 1.0, the project is expected to deliver a positive net present value to a firm and its investors.\n\nBenefit-cost ratios (BCRs) are most often used incapital budgetingto analyze the overall value for money of undertaking a new project. However, the cost-benefit analyses for large projects can be hard to get right, because there are so many assumptions and uncertainties that are hard to quantify. This is why there is usually a wide range of potential BCR outcomes.\n\nThe BCR also does not provide any sense of how much economic value will be created, so the BCR is usually used to get a rough idea about the viability of a project and how much the internal rate of return (IRR) exceeds the discount rate, which is the company\u2019sweighted average cost of capital (WACC)\u2014the opportunity cost of that capital.\n\nThe BCR is calculated by dividing the proposed total cash benefit of a project by the proposed total cash cost of the project. Prior to dividing the numbers, the net present value of the respective cash flows over the proposed lifetime of the project\u2014taking into account theterminal values, including salvage/remediation costs\u2014is calculated.\n\nIf a project has a BCR that is greater than 1.0, the project is expected to deliver a positivenet present value (NPV)and will have aninternal rate of return (IRR)above the discount rate used in the DCF calculations. This suggests that the NPV of the project\u2019scash flowsoutweighs the NPV of the costs, and the project should be considered.\n\nIf the BCR is equal to 1.0, the ratio indicates that the NPV of expected profits equals the costs. If a project\u2019s BCR is less than 1.0, the project\u2019s costs outweigh the benefits, and it should not be considered.\n\nAs an example, assume Company ABC wishes to assess the profitability of a project that involves renovating an apartment building over the next year. The company decides to lease the equipment needed for the project for $50,000 rather than purchase it. The inflation rate is 2%, and the renovations are expected to increase the company\u2019s annualprofitby $100,000 for the next three years.\n\nThe NPV of the total cost of the lease does not need to be discounted, because the initial cost of $50,000 is paid upfront. The NPV of the projected benefits is $288,388, or ($100,000 / (1 + 0.02)^1) + ($100,000 / (1 + 0.02)^2) + ($100,00 / (1 + 0.02)^3). Consequently, the BCR is 5.77, or $288,388 divided by $50,000.\n\nIn this example, our company has a BCR of 5.77, which indicates that the project\u2019s estimated benefits significantly outweigh its costs. Moreover, Company ABC could expect $5.77 in benefits for each $1 of costs.\n\nThe primary limitation of the BCR is that it reduces a project to a simple number when the success or failure of an investment or expansion relies on many factors and can be undermined by unforeseen events. Simply following a rule that above 1.0 means success and below 1.0 spells failure is misleading and can provide a false sense of comfort with a project.\n\nThe BCR must be used as a tool in conjunction with other types of analysis to make a well-informed decision.\n\nThe BRC is used in cost-benefit analysis to describe the connection between the costs and benefits of a potential project.\n\nThe benefit-cost ratio is determined by dividing the proposed total cash benefit of a project by the proposed total\u00a0cash cost of the project.\n\nA reading over 1.0 suggests that on a broad level, a project should be financially successful; a reading of 1.0 suggests that the benefits equal the costs; and a reading below 1.0 suggests that the costs trump the benefits.\n\nThe benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is used in a cost-benefit analysis to get a summary of the overall relationship between the relative costs and benefits of a proposed project. A project with a BCR greater than 1.0 is expected to deliver a positive net present value (NPV) to a firm and its investors.",
