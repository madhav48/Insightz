  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA general partner is one of two or more investors who jointly own a business that is structured as a partnership, and who assumes a day-to-day role in managing it.\n\nA generalpartnerhas the authority to act on behalf of the business without the knowledge or permission of the other partners. Unlike alimitedorsilent partner, the general partner may haveunlimited liabilityfor the debts of the business.\n\nGeneral partners typically bring specialized knowledge and skills to the partnership and contribute to its pool of contacts and clients. Since they share management responsibilities, each has more time to devote to their respective professional duties.\n\nThe main benefit of a partnership is that it isn't taxed separately. In other words, the IRS (Internal Revenue Service) doesn't require partnerships to pay corporate taxes on profits. Instead, each partner receives their share of the profits as income and file and pay their own taxes.\n\nOn the flip side, a general partner may be held personally responsible for the liabilities of the partnership. For example, a patient might sue a doctor for medicalmalpractice. In some cases, courts have allowed the client to proceed against all of the general partners in the medical practice.\n\nIf the court enters a judgment in favor of the client, all the general partners would be financially responsible. In fact, the general partner with the most money invested in the business could bear a larger proportion of the penalty than the general partner whose alleged malpractice caused the suit.\n\nIf a general partner is ever required to meet the partnership's financial obligations, their personal assets may be subject toliquidation.\n\nThe general partner shares the expenses and responsibilities of operating the business and shares in the profits if it is successful.\n\nA partnership is any business entity that is formed by at least two people who agree to create a company and share in its expenses and profits. This type of arrangement is particularly appealing to legal, medical, and creative professionals who prefer tobe their own bossesbut want to expand their business reach.\n\nA partnership also offers a pool of investment for building and maintaining a business on a scale that might be beyond the resources of a single individual. In such cases, each professional becomes a general partner under the terms of the partnership agreement. They share the expenses and responsibilities of operating the business and share in the profits if it is successful.\n\nIn the case of alimited partnership, only one of the partners will become the general partner while the others will have limited liability. That is, their responsibility for debts is restricted to the amount they invested in the business. A limited partner is primarily an investor in the business who does not take an active role in its operations.",
