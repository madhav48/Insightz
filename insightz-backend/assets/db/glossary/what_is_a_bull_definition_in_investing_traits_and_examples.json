  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nA bull is an investor who thinks the market, a specific security, or an industry is poised to rise. Investors who adopt\u00a0a bull approach purchasesecuritiesunder the assumption that they\u00a0can sell them later at a higher price.\n\nBulls are optimistic investors who are\u00a0attempting to profit from the upward movement of stocks, with certainstrategiessuited to that theory.\n\nBullish investors identify\u00a0securities that are likely to increase in value and direct available funds toward those investments.\n\nOpportunities to assume the position of a bull investor exist even when an overall market or sector is in a bearish trend. Bull investors look for growth opportunities within the down market and may look tocapitalizeshould market conditions reverse.\n\nCharacteristics of a bull market include:\n\nTo limit the risk of losses, a bull may employ the use ofstop-loss orders.\n\nThis allows the investor to specify a price at which to sell the associated security should prices begin to move downward. Additionally, these investors may purchaseputsto help compensate for any risk present in a portfolio.\n\nBulls can also use diversification to mitigate risk. By spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, styles, and geographic regions, investors can still remain bullish without putting too many eggs in one basket.\n\nBull investors must be mindful of what is\u00a0commonly known as bull traps.\n\nA bull trap exists when an investor believes a sudden increase in the value of a particular security is the beginning of a trend resulting in the investorgoing long. This can\u00a0lead to a buying frenzy where, as more investors purchase the security, the price continues to inflate. Once those interested in purchasing the security have completed the trades, demand may decline and lower associated security prices.\n\nAs the price declines, bull investors must choose whether to hold or sell the security.\n\nIf investors begin to sell, the price may experience further decline. This may prompt\u00a0a new round of investors to sell their holdings and drive the price down even further. In cases where a bull trap existed, the associated stock price often does not recover.\n\nA bear is the opposite of a bull. Bear investors believe that the value of a specific security or industry is likely to decline in the future. Abear marketoccurs when the market experiences prolong price declines\u2014typically when securities prices fall by 20% or more and there is negative investor sentiment.\n\nIf you are bullish on theS&P 500, you attempt to profit from a rise in the index by going long. Bears, however, are pessimistic and believe that a particular security, commodity, or entity is set to suffer a decline in price.\n\nBullishness and bearishness do not necessarily apply only to the stock market. People can be bullish or bearish on any investment opportunity, including real estate and commodities,\u00a0such as soybeans, crude oil, or even peanuts.\n\nOne of the best examples of a bull market was thesharp rise in US technology stocksduring the late 1990s. Between 1995 and its highest point in March 2000, theNasdaq Indexgained a whopping 400%.\n\nUnfortunately, the Nasdaq crashed nearly 80% over the following several months, essentially giving back all of the gains made during the bull run.\n\nAnother famous example of a bull market was the extreme run-up in U.S. housing prices in the mid-2000s. It was fueled by easy-money policies, relaxed lending standards, rampant speculation, unregulated derivatives, and irrational exuberance.\n\nThe housing bubble was directly related to and possibly the root cause of the2007\u20132008 financial crisis.\n\nAlways be on the lookout for early signs that a bull run may be coming to an end. For instance, U.S. homeownership had peaked at 69.2% in 2004.And in 2006, home prices began to fall. Yet the risks only became apparent to most investors in August 2007.\n\nBullish stocks are typically defined as stocks that display abullish price pattern. In order to identify bullish stocks, there's no substitute for learning the ins and outs of technical analysis.\n\nOf course, traders should also familiarize themselves with technical indicators such as overlays and oscillators.\n\nSome of the more common bullish patterns used by traders and investors include:\n\nFour of themost commonly used technical analysis indicatorsare:\n\nA bullish reversal is a pattern that represents a price decline, followed by a rebound. Common types of bullish reversal patterns include:\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Homeownership Rate for the United States.\" Accessed June 13, 2021.",
