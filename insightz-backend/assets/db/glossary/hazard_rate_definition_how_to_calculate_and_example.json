  "definition": "The hazard rate refers to the rate of death for an item of a given age (x).\u00a0It is part of a larger equation called the hazard function, which analyzes the likelihood that an item\u00a0will survive to a certain point in time, based on its survival to an earlier time (t). In other words, it is the likelihood that if something survives to one moment, it will also survive to the next.\n\nThe hazard rate only applies to items that\u00a0cannot be repaired and is sometimes referred to as the failure rate. It is fundamental to the design of safe systems in applications and is often relied on incommerce, engineering,finance,insurance, and regulatory industries.\n\nThe hazard rate measures the propensity of an item to fail or die depending on the age it has reached. It is part of a wider branch ofstatisticscalledsurvival analysis, which is a set of methods for predicting the amount of time until a certain event occurs, such as the death or failure of an engineering system or component.\n\nThe concept\u00a0is applied to\u00a0other branches of research under slightly different names,\u00a0including reliability analysis (engineering),duration analysis(economics), and event history analysis (sociology).\n\nThe hazard rate for any time can be determined using the following equation:\n\nh(t)=f(t)/R(t)h(t) = f(t) / R(t)h(t)=f(t)/R(t)\n\nF(t) is theprobability density function (PDF), or the probability that the value (failure or death) will fall in a specified interval, such as a specific year. R(t), on the other hand, represents the survival function, or the probability that something will survive past a certain time (t).\n\nThe hazard rate cannot be negative.\n\nThe probability density calculates the probability of failure at any given time. For instance, a person is certain to die eventually. As you get older, you have a greater chance of dying at a specific age, since the average failure rate is calculated as a fraction of the number of units that exist in a specific interval, divided by the number of total units at the beginning of the interval.\n\nIf we were to calculate a person's chances of dying at a certain age, we would divide one year by the number of years that person potentially has left to live. This number would grow larger each year.\n\nA person aged 60 would have a higher probability of dying at age 65 than a\u00a0person aged 30 because the person aged 30 still has many more units of time (years) left in their life, and the probability that the person\u00a0will die during one specific unit of time is lower.\n\nIn many instances, the hazard rate can resemble the shape of a bathtub. The curve slopes downwards at the beginning, indicating a decreasing hazard rate, then levels out to be constant, before moving upwards as the item in question ages.\n\nThink of it this way: when an auto manufacturer puts together a car, its components are generally not expected to fail in its first few years of service. However, a tiny portion of cars will fail quickly due to factory defects. Once a new car has shown that it is free of such defects, it is not expected to fail for many years. As the car ages, the probability of malfunction increases. By the time the curve slopes upwards, theuseful lifeperiod of the product has expired and the chance of non-random issues suddenly occurring becomes much more likely.\n\nThe hazard rate and failure rate are essentially the same thing. Failure rate is basically another way to say hazard rate.\n\nThe hazard rate seeks to determine the chances of survival of its subject at a certain time point. It can effectively be applied to almost any item, and is commonly used in engineering, medicine, and insurance.\n\nThe bathtub curve\u00a0is a visual representation of the\u00a0typical failure rate\u00a0of a product or group of products over time.\u00a0The bathtub image maps out three distinct periods. The initial downward slope, also known as \u201cinfant mortality,\u201d represents the timeframe when the product is first used and goes from a high failure occurrence to a low one. Next, the line levels out and becomes flat, depicting the useful life period when assets are expected to have a relatively constant failure risk. Then finally the slope moves upward, taking the form of a bathtub, as the product in question enters its wear-out period and degrades at an accelerated pace.\n\nThe hazard rate is a simple yet effective way to determine the likelihood that an item\u00a0will survive to a given time point. That might not sound particularly useful or groundbreaking. However, in certain industries, the concept is used to make key decisions.\n\nBoston University. \"Survival Analysis.\"",
