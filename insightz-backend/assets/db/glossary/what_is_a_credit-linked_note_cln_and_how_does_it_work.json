  "term": "What Is a Credit-Linked Note (CLN), and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA credit-linked note (CLN) is a security with an embeddedcredit default swappermitting the issuer to shift specific credit risk to credit investors. Credit-linked notes are created through aspecial purpose vehicle(SPV), or trust, which is collateralized with AAA-rated securities. Investors buy credit-linked notes from a trust that pays a fixed or floating coupon during the life of the note. In return for accepting exposure to specified credit risks, investors who buy credit-linked notes typically earn a higher rate of return compared to other bonds.\n\nBased on the fact that credit-linked notes are backed by specified loans, there is an innaterisk of defaultassociated with the security. To create a credit-linked note, a loan must be issued to a customer. Meanwhile, an institution may choose to hold the loan and earn\u00a0income based on interest payments received as the loan is repaid, or it may sell the loan to another institution.\n\nIn the latter option, loans are sold to an SPV\u00a0or trust, which ultimately divides the loan into various parts, often bundling similar parts together based on the overall risk or rating. The bundled parts are used to create securities that investors can purchase.\n\nAt maturity, the investors receiveparunless the referenced credit defaults or declares bankruptcy, in which case they receive an amount equal to therecovery rate. The trust enters into a default swap with a deal arranger.\n\nA credit-linked note functions similarly to a bond in that payments are made semi-annually, but with a credit default swap attached. The SPV\u00a0or trust pays the dealer par minus the recovery rate in exchange for an annual fee, which is passed on to the investors in the form of a higher yield on the notes.\n\nUnder this structure, the coupon, or price of the note, is linked to the performance of a reference asset. It offers borrowers ahedgeagainst credit risk and gives investors a higher yield on the note for accepting exposure to a specifiedcredit event.\n\nThe use of a credit default swap allows the risk associated with default to be sold to other parties and provides a function similar to insurance. Investors generally receive a higherrate of returnthan on other bonds as compensation for the additional risk associated with the security.\n\nIn case of default, all involved parties including the SPV\u00a0or trust, investors and, at times, the original lender are at risk for losses. The amount of loss experienced will vary depending on the number of loans, or parts of loans, present in the security, how many of the associated loans end up in default,\u00a0and how many investors are participating in the particular security packages.\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). \"Financial Institution Letters: Examination Treatment for Certain Types of Credit-Linked Notes.\"",
