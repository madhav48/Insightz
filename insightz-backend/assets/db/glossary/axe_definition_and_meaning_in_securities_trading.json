  "term": "Axe: Definition and Meaning in Securities Trading",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn axe (or \"axe to grind\") is the interest that a trader shows in buying or selling a security that is typically already on the books. If a trader holds a long position but has short-term concerns, that trader\u2019s axe toward short-termputoptions may be significant. Likewise, if a trader has risk exposure to an increase in interest rates, they may have an axe tohedgeagainst that risk.\n\nMany times, a trader with an axe will keep that information private. That is\u00a0because if other market participants become aware of one's motivations, they can take advantage of that information by offering unfavorable prices or withholding certain trades in order to exploit the situation.\n\nThe term \"axe\" is derived from the phrase \u201caxe to grind,\u201d which means to possess an ulterior motive or selfish aim. The phrase has historically meant to have a grievance with someone, especially where one feels the need to seek retribution. The phrase probably originates from the act of sharpening an axe with a grinding wheel, with the intent (in this definition) to get revenge on someone by maiming or killing them.\n\nTraders often use the term \"axe\" to represent someone\u2019s particular interest in buying or selling a security that is already in their inventory, or hedging against it. The term was historically used to reference bond holdings, but traders have expanded the use to include allsecurities. In conversation, the term is often used to speculate about a trader\u2019s plan with regard\u00a0to a security that they hold.\n\nAxe should not be confused with \"ax,\" which is amarket makercentral to the price action of a specific security.\n\nThe term \"axe\" can be used in many different ways, which makes the context of the conversation important to consider.\n\nSuppose that a trader has a large position in a given security. If that trader shops around for quotes with the intent of selling the stake, the trader who provides the quote may be at a disadvantage if they are unaware that the first trader has an axe with regard to the security. The second trader may ask, \u201cDo they have an axe on this security?\u201d which means \u201cDo they have plans to sell this security?\u201d\n\nTraders may also use the term to represent securities related to the securities that they hold. For instance, a trader may hold along positionand have an axe toward put options if nervous about the stock\u2019s short-term prospects.\n\nHaving an axe is often kept secret because knowledge of that information can be used by other market participants to exploit the situation for their own gain, and at the expense of the axe holder. That said, traders with good rapport may ask each other outright if they have a particular axe in the hopes that the other trader's axe(s) will be opposite from their own\u2014this way they can affect a trade or trades with each other in a mutually beneficial manner.",
