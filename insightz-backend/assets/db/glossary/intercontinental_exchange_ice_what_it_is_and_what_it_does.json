In March 2009, ICE Clear Credit was created and approved by the Federal Reserve as a bank and two years later, was designated as a clearing house and regulated by the CFTC and SEC.ICE was the first to offer clearing services in the OTC energy and credit derivatives markets.According to ICE's Q1 2022 report, ICE had cleared more than $16.4 trillion in credit default swaps, up YOY by 9.7%.\n\nSince its founding in 2000, ICE's company growth has primarily been achieved through the acquisition of other exchanges.
