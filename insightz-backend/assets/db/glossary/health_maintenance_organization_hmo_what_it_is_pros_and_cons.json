  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAn individual shopping forhealth insurancemay find a variety of insurance providers with unique features. One popular type of insurance provider is the health maintenance organization (HMO), which provides coverage through a network of physicians.\n\nThere are severalkey differencesbetween HMO plans and the more widely usedpreferred provider organization (PPO) plans. With an HMO plan, your primary care physician will refer you to specialists and you must stay within a network of providers to receive coverage. HMO plans typically have lower premiums than PPO plans.\n\nHMOs provide health insurance coverage for a monthly or annual fee. An HMO typically limits member coverage to medical care provided by doctors, hospitals, and other healthcare providers within its network, except for emergencies and out-of-area urgent care.\n\nWith guaranteed patient volume, providers enter into contracts at discounted rates, enabling HMOs to reduce costs and offer lowerpremiumsthan other health plans. However, this system may narrow the care options available to HMO members.\n\nWhen deciding whether to choose an HMO plan, you should consider:\n\nAn HMO is ahealth insurance providernetwork that provides basic and supplemental health services to its subscribers. The organization builds its network of healthcare providers by contracting with PCPs, clinical facilities, and specialists.\n\nIn addition to cost savings, the agreed-upon contracts with providers help ensure consistent and structured care standards across HMO networks. With a coordinated system of referrals and communication between primary care physicians and specialists, HMOs are known for providing subscribers with integrated care that focuses on prevention and wellness.\n\nThe HMO as it exists today was established under the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. The law clarified the definition of HMOs as \u201ca public or private entity organized to provide basic and supplemental health services to its members.\u201d The law further requires that plans provide insured individuals with basic healthcare in exchange for regular, fixed premiums that are established \u201cunder a community rating system.\u201d\n\nHMO subscribers pay a monthly or annual premium to access medical services from healthcare providers within the HMO's network. Although subscribers are typically limited to in-network care, if they require emergency care\u2014sudden illnesses or injuries that are life-threatening\u2014and certain urgent treatments, such as dialysis, most HMOs will cover these from out-of-network providers.\n\nThose insured under an HMO may need to live or work within the plan's geographic area to be eligible for coverage. However, if a subscriber requires urgent care\u2014an illness or injury that needs prompt treatment, typically within 24 to 48 hours\u2014most HMOs will cover out-of-network providers if the subscriber is outside the plan\u2019s geographic area.Subscribers who receive other nonemergency, out-of-network care, including routine urgent care, will have to pay for itout of pocket.\n\nIn addition to low premiums, there are typically low or nodeductibleswith an HMO. Instead, the organization charges aco-payfor each clinical visit, test, or prescription.\n\nThe insured party must choose a PCP from the network of local healthcare providers under an HMO plan. A PCP is typically an individual\u2019sfirst point of contactfor all health-related issues. This means that an insured person cannot see a specialist without first receiving a referral from their PCP.\n\nHowever certain specialized services may not require a referral. For example, annual mammograms for women over the age of 40 will not require doctor referrals.\n\nSpecialists to whom PCPs typically refer insured members are within the HMO coverage network, so their services are covered under the HMO plan after co-pays are paid. If a PCP leaves the network, subscribers are notified so they can choose another PCP from within the HMO plan.\n\nHistorically, the regulation of health insurance\u2014including HMOs\u2014has fallen under state jurisdiction; however, since the passage of thePatient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)in 2010, federal laws have also played a significant role.\n\nHowever, the dominant role of state regulation in health insurance has continued, largely due to the impact of theMcCarran-Ferguson Act of 1945, which established that states regulate the insurance industry and that no federal law can override state regulation unless it explicitly states otherwise.\n\nOther legislation, such as the HMO Act of 1973 and theEmployee Retirement Income Security Act(ERISA) of 1974, has also brought certain aspects of the health insurance business under the federal government's purview.\n\nThe federal government's role in the insurance sector at large has expanded through acts like the 2010Dodd-Frank Act,which established theFederal Insurance Office(FIO). Although the FIO's authority does not extend to health insurance, it reflects the broader expansion of federal regulation and oversight across the insurance industry.\n\nTheAffordable Care Actof 2010 created theACA Health Insurance Marketplace, which provides access to affordable health insurance for individuals, families, and small businesses. The ACA Marketplace offers a variety of health insurance plans, including HMOs and PPOs among others, to fit individual needs and budgets.\n\nPreferred provider organization (PPO)plans are the most common type of plan among U.S. workers who are covered through their employers, according to research firm KFF. Approximately 47% of covered workers are enrolled in a PPO in the most recent survey, versus 13% enrolled in an HMO. Another 29% were covered by ahigh-deductible health planand 10% by point-of-service plans. Just one percent of workers are still covered by traditionalindemnityplans.\n\nA preferred provider organization is a type of managed-care health insurance plan. PPO medical and healthcare providers are called preferred providers. Medical and healthcare personnel who are part of the PPO network are called preferred providers.\n\nPPO participants are free to use the services of any provider within their network. Out-of-network care is available, but it costs more to the insured.\u00a0In contrast to PPO plans, HMO plans require participants to receive healthcare services within an assigned network. Medical and dentalPPO plans usually have deductibles, while HMO plans typically do not.\n\nBoth programs allow for specialist services. However, in an HMO, the designated PCP must provide a referral to a specialist. Although HMOs are the oldest type of managed healthcare plan currently in use, PPO plans have long been popular due to their flexibility, including the option to see out-of-network providers and visit specialists without referrals.\n\nHowever,compared to HMOs, PPOs often come with higher premiums and out-of-pocket costs. Over time, the advantages of PPOs have narrowed as insurers reduce provider networks and take additional measures to control costs.\n\nApoint-of-service (POS) planis like an HMO plan in that it requires a policyholder to choose an in-network PCP and get referrals from that doctor if they want the plan to cover a specialist\u2019s services.A POS plan is also like a PPO plan: it still provides coverage for out-of-network services, but the policyholder has to pay more for those services than if they used in-network providers.\n\nA POS plan may offer better cost-sharing for out-of-network services if the policyholder obtains a referral from their PCP, compared to going without a referral. However, without a referral, some POS plans may not cover the costs at all.The premiums for a POS plan fall between the lower premiums offered by an HMO and the higher premiums of a PPO.\n\nPOS plans require the policyholder to make co-pays, but in-network co-pays are often just $10 to $25 per appointment. POS plans also do not have deductibles for in-network services, which is a significant advantage over PPOs.\n\nSome POS plans may offer out-of-network coverage, which can benefit patients who travel frequently. A disadvantage is that out-of-network deductibles tend to be high for POS plans. Patients who use out-of-network services will pay the full cost of care out of pocket until they reach the plan\u2019s deductible. However, a patient who never uses a POS plan\u2019s out-of-network services probably would be better off with an HMO because of its lower premiums.\n\nIf you don\u2019t travel frequently, you\u2019ll be better off with an HMO plan than a POS plan because of the lower costs.\n\nIt\u2019s important to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of HMO plans before you choose a plan, just as you would with any other option. We\u2019ve listed some of the most common pros and cons of the program below.\n\nPrimary care physician directing your treatment\n\nMust use medical professionals in the plan\u2019s network\n\nNo specialist visits without a referral\n\nEmergencies must meet certain conditions\n\nLower out-of-pocket costs: You\u2019ll pay fixed monthly or annual premiums that are lower than traditional forms of health insurance. These plans tend to come with low or no deductibles, and your co-pays are generally lower than those found in other plans. Your out-of-pocket costs will also be lower for your prescriptions. Billing tends to be less complicated.\n\nPrimary care physician directing your treatment: You will choose a PCP who is responsible for managing your treatment and care. This professional will also advocate for services on your behalf, such as making referrals for specialty services for you.\n\nHigher quality of care: The quality of care is generally higher with an HMO plan because patients are encouraged to prioritize preventive care, such as annual physicals, and to seek treatment early.\n\nMust use medical professionals in the plan\u2019s network: You\u2019re restricted on how you can use the plan. You must designate a doctor within the network who will be responsible for your healthcare needs, including primary care and referrals. If you see someone out of network, you are typically responsible for all costs incurred, although some HMOs may cover certain out-of-network services in emergencies or if no network providers are available.\"\n\nNo specialist visits without a referral: You\u2019ll need referrals for any specialists if you want your HMO to pay for those visits. If you need to visit a rheumatologist or a dermatologist, for example, your PCP must make a referral before you can see one for the plan to pay for your visit. If not, you\u2019re responsible for the entire cost.\n\nEmergencies must meet certain conditions: There are usually very strict definitions of what constitutes an emergency. If your condition doesn\u2019t fit the criteria, the HMO plan won\u2019t pay.\n\nThe main benefits are cost and quality of care. People who purchase HMO plans enjoy lower premiums than traditional forms of health insurance. The plan's focus on preventative medicine allows insured parties to get a higher quality of care from providers who are contracted with the organization. HMOs typically come with low or no deductibles and relatively low co-pays.\n\nAlmost every major insurance company provides an HMO plan. For instance, Cigna and Humana provide their own versions of the HMO. Aetna offers individuals two options: the Aetna HMO and the Aetna Health Network Only plan.\n\nBoth an HMO and a PPO use a network of physicians and specialists to help control costs. HMOs tend to have lower premiums and require you to obtain a referral from your primary care physician to see an in-network specialist. PPOs allow you to see any specialist without requiring referrals, but the fees and deductibles for out-of-network services are higher.\n\nCoverage under an HMO is generally fairly restrictive and comes at a lower cost to insured parties. Traditional medical insurance charges higher premiums, higher deductibles, and higher co-pays. However, non-HMO plans are much more flexible. People with health insurance don\u2019t need to have a primary care physician to outline treatment. Health insurance also pays some of the costs for out-of-network providers.\n\nHealth insurance is an important consideration for every individual and family. Choosing the right plan depends on your personal situation, including your health,finances, and quality of life. You can choose from traditional health insurance such as a PPO or an HMO. The HMO provides lower out-of-pocket costs but carries more restrictive conditions. Make sure you weigh the benefits and disadvantages of each plan before youchoose your coverage.\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).\"\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"Health Maintenance Organization.\"\n\nUnited Healthcare. \"What Does HMO Stand For?\"\n\nU.S. Government Accountability Office. \"Implementation of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, as Amended.\"\n\nU.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"What's an HMO?\"\n\nKaiser Permanente. \"The costs of an HMO plan.\"\n\nU.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. \"HMOs: Do I have to get a referral to use a specialist?\"\n\nKFF. \"What Federal Requirements Apply to Health Insurance?\"\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \"McCarran-Ferguson Act.\"\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \"Federal Insurance Office (FIO)\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Health insurance plan & network types: HMOs, PPOs, and more.\"\n\nKFF. \"2023 Employer Health Benefits Survey.\"\n\nHealthCare.gov. \"Preferred Provider Organization (PPO).\"\n\nHumana. \"Dental HMO vs. PPO insurance plans: What\u2019s the difference?\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \u201cPoint of Service (POS) Plans.\"\n\nPeopleKeep. \"POS Health Plans: Primary care physician (PCP) and referrals to specialists.\"\n\nCigna. \"Comparing costs between PPO and POS.\"\n\nGoodRx. \"What Are The Pros And Cons Of A Point-of-Service Health Plan?\"\n\nAetna. \u201cThe Right HMO Coverage, for the Right Care.\u201d",
