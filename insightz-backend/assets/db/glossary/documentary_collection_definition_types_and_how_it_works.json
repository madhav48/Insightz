  "term": "Documentary Collection: Definition, Types, and How It Works",
  "definition": "Documentary collection is a form oftrade financein which an exporter is paid for its goods by an importer after the two parties' banks exchange the required documents. The exporter's bank collects funds from the importer's bank in exchange for documents releasing title to the shipped merchandise, usually after the goods arrive at the importer's location.\n\nDocumentary collection is so-called because the exporter receives payment from the importer in exchange for the shipping documents. Shipping documents are required for the buyer\u00a0to clear the goods through customs and take delivery.They include a commercial invoice,certificate of origin, insurance certificate, and packing list.\n\nA key document in a documentary collection is thebill of exchangeor draft, which is a formal demand for payment from the exporter to importer.\n\nDocumentary collection is less common than other forms of trade finance, such asletters of creditand advance payment. It is less expensive than some methods but also somewhat riskier, so is generally limited to transactions between parties who have developed trust or are located in countries with strong legal systems and contract enforcement.\n\nA sight draft reduces the exporter's risk because the buyer's bank will not release the documents without payment from the buyer, but neither side's bank assumes any financial responsibility in a documentary collection transaction.\n\nDocumentary collections falls into two basic categories, depending on when the payment is made to the exporter:\n\nBelow is the step-by-step process:\n\nThe exporter's risk is higher with atime draftversus asight draft, as the buyer's bank would have released the documents with the buyer's acceptance of the time draft\u2014meaning the buyer could already have possession of the merchandise by the time payment is due.\n\nThe seller's risk is limited with a sight draft. This is because the buyer's bank would not release the documents needed to take possession of the goods before payment is made. At worst, the seller would have to find another buyer or pay to have the goods shipped back.\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \"Methods of Payment:Documentary Collections.\"\n\nPrivacy Shield Framework. \"Trade Finance Guide: Documentary Collections.\"",
