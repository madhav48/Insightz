  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nUnfair claims practice is the\u00a0improper avoidance of aclaim by an insureror an attempt to reduce the size of the claim. By engaging in unfair claims practices, an insurer tries to reduce its costs. However, this is illegal in many jurisdictions.\n\nTheNational Association of Insurance Commissioners(NAIC) has created a model of unfair claims practice\u00a0legislation that mandates\u00a0claims be handled fairly and that there beclear communicationbetween the insurer and the insured.States, not the federal government, regulate insurance; many jurisdictions have implemented unfair claims practices laws modeled after the NAIC's model act.\n\nAlso, most states have enacted a version of this\u00a0model law. Called the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, it protects insurance buyers from unjust behavior by insurers in the claims settlement process. Specifics of the\u00a0law vary from state to state. Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts (UCSPA) are not federal law; instead, they\u00a0are enforced by individual state insurance departments.\n\nConsider a small business owner that insures his\u00a0company's building and business personal property under a\u00a0commercial property policy. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the\u00a0building, causing $100,000 in property damage. The insurance company delays payment, rendering the business owner\u00a0unable to repair any of the damage.\u00a0The insurance company continues\u00a0using delay tactics to avoid making a payment. For example, the\u00a0claims representative keeps\u00a0\"forgetting\" to send the claim forms. Also,\u00a0theadjustersays he needs another proof of loss, but the small business owner has already\u00a0submitted\u00a0proof of loss twice. These are the types of situations that unfair claims practice laws are designed to prevent.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \"Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act.\"",
