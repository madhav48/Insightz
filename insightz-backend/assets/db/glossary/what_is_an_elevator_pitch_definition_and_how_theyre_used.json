  "definition": "Elevator pitch is a\u00a0slang term used to describe a brief speech that outlines an idea for a product, service, or project.

Moreover, the pitch is intended to explain, in clear and direct terms, why the idea or product can succeed where other novel concepts have not.\n\nDepending on the circumstances, some elevator pitches may be longer than the proverbial elevator ride and can go into greater detail about the team involved in developing the idea. The pitch may also provide more information about how the concept will be brought to market, ways it will grow acustomer base, and what the broader market opportunities are for the concept.\n\nA twit pitch orpitch on the X platform (formerly Twitter)is even shorter than an elevator pitch. At a standard 280 characters, this type of pitch uses the social media platform to provide a condensed version of a business idea.\n\nElevator pitches may be used at some events as a form of contest, where the presenters compete for prizes that might assist them in furthering their ideas. This can include nominal funding or business services\u00a0and mentoring with business veterans. Regardless of winning such a contest, the opportunity to present ideas before an audience ofangel investors, venture capitalists, and other possible backers can be seen as a significant benefit of the pitch.\n\nFans of the popular TV showShark Tankare familiar with the show's concept that allows budding entrepreneurs the opportunity topitch their startup businessesto a panel of investor \"sharks.\" While each entrepreneur's pitch is much longer than a standard elevator pitch, you can still use key elements that appear in most successfulShark Tankpresentations as a model to help you create an effective elevator pitch for your own business.\n\nTaking our cue fromShark Tank, you'll want to include the following elements in your elevator pitch:\n\nYour elevator pitch should be concise, engaging, and offer just enough tantalizing details that hook your potential \"shark investor\" into asking for more information then and there or for a follow-up meeting at a later date.\n\nThe material you include in your pitch depends on context: what are you pitching, and what do you hope to achieve?
