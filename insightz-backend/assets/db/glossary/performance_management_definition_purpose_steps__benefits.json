  "definition": "Performance management is a tool that helps managers monitor and evaluate employees' work. The goal of performance management is to create an environment where people can perform to the best of their abilities and in alignment with the organization's overall goals. Performance management is widely used in both the private and public sectors.\n\nA formal performance-management program helps managers and employees see eye-to-eye about expectations, goals, and career progress, including how an individual's work aligns with the company's overall vision.\n\nIt helps direct the funds allocated as a part of thecompany's performance budget. Generally speaking, performance management views individuals in the context of the broader workplace system. In theory, companies seek theabsolute performance standard, even though that is considered to be unattainable.\n\nPerformance-management programs use traditional tools such as setting and measuring goals, objectives, and milestones. They also aim to define what effective individual performance looks like and develop processes to measure it. However, instead of using the traditional paradigm of year-end reviews, performance management turns every interaction with an employee into an occasion to learn.\n\nManagers can use performance management tools to adjust workflow, recommend new courses of action, and make other decisions that will help employees achieve their objectives. In turn, this helps the company reach its goals and perform optimally.\n\nPercentage of workers who very strongly agreed with the statement \"My manager includes me in goal setting\" in an August 2023 Gallup survey.\n\nFor example, the manager of a sales department can give staff members target revenue volumes that they must reach within a set time period. In a performance management system, along with the numbers, the manager would offer guidance gauged to help the salespeople succeed.\n\nFocusing on continuousaccountabilitycreates a healthier, moretransparentwork environment, and emphasis on regular meetings can improve overall communications. Because performance management establishes concrete rules, everyone has a clearer understanding of the expectations.\n\nWhen expectations are clear, the workplace is less stressful. Employees are not trying to impress a manager by doing some random task, and managers aren't worried about how to tell employees that they are not performing well. If the system is working, they probably know it already.\n\nAlthough off-the-shelf performance-management software packages exist, templates are generally customized for a specific organization's needs. Typically, effective performance-management programs include certain universal elements, such as:\n\nAdvocates of performance management maintain that it not only helps organizations attain their goals but also makes work more fulfilling for individual employees, with the bottom-line benefit of improved worker retention.\n\nFor example, workers often feel blindsided by negative annual performance reviews. While performance management may also incorporate annual reviews, the ongoing feedback that managers provide throughout the year should result in fewer unpleasant surprises.\n\nAs the polling firm Gallup, which conducts worldwide surveys on workplace issues, puts it, effective performance management requires \"managers to think of themselves as coaches, not bosses. And when managers have timely, performance-related conversations that reflect this principle, manager-employee interactions feel encouraging, engaging, and rewarding in ways that annual reviews do not.\"\n\nThe benefits can also extend outside the organization, with studies showing that performance management often produces greater customer satisfaction.\n\nSomewhat similar to performance management,management by objectives (MBO)is a corporate leadership model that attempts to align employees' goals with those of an organization. It is often broken down into five basic steps: defining objectives, communicating those objectives to employees, monitoring employees' progress, evaluating their performance, and rewarding their achievements.\n\nLike performance management, MBO encourages (in theory at least) employee participation in goal-setting. However, MBO is frequently criticized as being too rigid and so focused on goals that employees and managers are driven to meet them no matter how they do so. According to an article in the January 2003Harvard Business Review, MBO is \"an approach to performance appraisal that's gone out of fashion for the most part.\"\n\nIn performance management, supervisors provide ongoing feedback to employees. Performance appraisals, on the other hand, tend to provide feedback looking back over a certain period, often a year. Companies that practice performance management can include an annual performance review as part of their process, so the two aren't mutually exclusive.\n\nSMART goals are part of a goal-setting system and philosophy used by many companies and other organizations, as well as by individuals. Following the SMART acronym, it advocates creating goals that are specific, measurable, achievable (or attainable), relevant, and time-bound.\n\nPerformance management, done properly, can have benefits for organizations and their employees alike. The key is employee involvement and regular, productive feedback to ensure that the employee is continuously evolving in a positive direction, which helps their career and the company's success.\n\nGallup. \"Leadership & Management.\"\n\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management. \"Good Performance Management Aids Retention and Productivity.\"\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Management by Whose Objectives?\"",
