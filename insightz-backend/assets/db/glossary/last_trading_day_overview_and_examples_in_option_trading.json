At the end of the last trading day, the contract holder must be prepared to accept delivery of the commodity or settle in cash if the position is not closed. The same concept applies tooptions contracts.\n\nThe last trading day is the final chance to close the position, otherwise the underlying will be delivered if applicable. If the option is worthless, then it does not need to be closed, it will simply expire.\n\nThe last trading day is the day before a derivative expires.

Subsequently, they will receive delivery notices and be required to arrange for the final delivery of the underlying assets.\n\nSuppose that a speculative futures trader purchases agold futurescontract with an expiration date of Aug. 27, 2021, which has a last trading day of Aug. 26, 2021. If the trader doesn't sell the contract by the end of the day on Aug. 26, the contract must be settled by delivery of the underlying asset. Most contracts also include acash settlementoption that relieves the two parties from thephysical exchangeor delivery of the underlying assets.\n\nOn the other hand, suppose a food production company purchasesorange juice futurescontracts with an expiry date of July 13, 2021. They may choose to take physical delivery of the orange juice since they can package it and sell it to customers or stores. After expiration, the production company would receive a delivery notice and be required to make arrangements for receipt of the orange juice.
