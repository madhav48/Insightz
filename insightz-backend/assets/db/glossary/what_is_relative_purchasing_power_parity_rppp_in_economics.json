  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nRelative purchasing power parity (RPPP)\u00a0is an expansion of the traditionalpurchasing\u00a0power parity(PPP) theory to include changes in inflation over time. Purchasing power is the power of money expressed by the number of goods or services that one unit can buy, and which can be reduced byinflation. RPPP suggests that countries with higher rates of inflation will have a devalued currency.\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bAccording to\u00a0relative purchasing\u00a0power parity (RPPP), the difference between the two countries\u2019 rates of inflation and the cost of commodities will drive changes in theexchange ratebetween the two countries.\n\nRPPP expands on the idea of purchasing\u00a0power parity and complements the theory of absolute purchasing power parity\u00a0(APPP). The APPP concept declares that the exchange rate between the two nations will be equal to the ratio of the price levels for those two countries, and APPP is discussed later in this article.\n\nPurchasing\u00a0power parity (PPP) is the idea that goods in one country will cost the same in another country, once their exchange rate is applied. According to this theory, twocurrenciesare at par when a market basket of goods is valued the same in both countries.\n\nThe comparison\u00a0of\u00a0prices of identical items in different countries will determine the PPP rate; however, an exact\u00a0comparison is difficult\u00a0due to differences in product quality, consumer attitudes, and economic conditions in each nation. Also,\u00a0purchasing power parity is a theoretical concept that may not be true in the real world, especially in the short run.\n\nIn 2023, the purchasing power index of the United States is 115.75.\n\nRPPP is essentially a dynamic form of PPP, as it relates the change in two countries\u2019 inflation rates to the change in their exchange rate. The theory holds that inflation will reduce the realpurchasing powerof a nation's currency. Thus if a country has an annual inflation rate of 10%, that country's currency will be able to purchase 10% less real goods at the end of one year.\n\nRPPP also complements the theory of absolute\u00a0purchasing\u00a0power parity (APPP), which maintains that the exchange rate between two countries will be identical to the ratio of the price levels for those two countries.\n\nThis concept comes from a basic idea known as thelaw of one price. This theory states that the real cost of a good must be the same across all countries after the consideration of\u00a0the exchange rate.\n\nSuppose that over the next year, inflation causes average prices for goods in the U.S. to increase by 3%. In the same period, prices for products in Mexico increased by 6%. We can say that Mexico has had higher inflation than the U.S. since prices there have risen faster by three points.\n\nAccording to the concept of relative purchase power parity, that three-point difference will drive a three-point change in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Mexico. So we can expect the Mexican peso todepreciateat the rate of 3% per year, or that the U.S. dollar should appreciate at the rate of 3% per year.\n\nUsers of RPPP information must be mindful of several limitations in the inherent process of calculating RPPP. Some of the limitations include:\n\nExchange rates can also be influenced by speculative trading and market sentiment; therefore, actual exchange rates may deviate from RPPP calculations.\n\nThere's a couple of differences between relative purchasing power parity and absolute purchasing power parity (APPP). First, PPP is primarily concerned with comparing the relative price levels of two or more countries to determine their exchange rates. Absolute PPP is a simpler concept that focuses on the absolute price levels within a single country.\n\nSecond, PPP suggests that exchange rates should adjust over time to equalize the purchasing power of currencies, allowing for a more accurate representation of the real exchange rate. APPP implies that exchange rates should be fixed or constant based on the ratio of absolute price levels between two countries.\n\nLast, PPP takes into account changes in price levels over time while APPP does not. Because APP assumes that exchange rates should always be at a constant ratio, it does not account for inflation.\n\nThe formula for purchasing power parity (PPP) is Cost of Good X in Currency 1 / Cost of Good X in Currency 2. This allows an individual to make comparisons of currencies and the value of a basket of goods they can buy.\n\nAccording to the crowdsourced database Numbeo, Luxembourg has the highest purchasing power with a purchasing power index number of 127.1 in 2023. Other top countries include Qatar (123.6), United Arab Emirates (123.4), and Switzerland (118.7). The lowest country in 2023 is Nigeria (8.4).\n\nPurchasing power parity is important because it allows economists tocompare two different economies, primarily the economic productivity and the standard of living among nations. It seeks to equalize currencies to determine the value of a basket of goods.\n\nRelative purchasing power parity is an economic theory that suggests exchange rates between two countries' currencies should adjust over time to reflect differences in their price levels. According to PPP, if one country experiences higher inflation than another, its currency should depreciate to maintain the same purchasing power across borders, promoting equilibrium in international trade.\n\nNumbeo. \"Purchasing Power Index by Country 2023.\"",
