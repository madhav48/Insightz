  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nCorporate bonds aredebt securities issued by a corporationin order to raise money to grow the business, pay bills, make capital improvements, make acquisitions, and for other business needs.\n\nBonds are sold to investors and the company gets the capital it needs and in return, the investor is paid a pre-established number of interest payments at either a fixed or variable interest rate. When the bond expires, or \"reaches maturity,\" the payments cease and the original investment is returned.\n\nThe backing for the bond is generally the ability of the company to repay, which depends on its prospects for future revenues and profitability. In some cases, the company's physical assets may be used ascollateral.\n\nIn the investment hierarchy, high-quality corporate bonds are considered a relatively safe and conservative investment. Investors building balanced portfolios often add bonds in order to offset riskier investments such as growth stocks.\n\nOver a lifetime, these investors tend to add more bonds and fewer risky investments in order to safeguard their accumulated capital. Retirees often invest a larger portion of their assets in bonds in order to establish a reliable income supplement.\n\nIn general, corporate bonds are considered to have a higher risk than U.S.government bonds. As a result, interest rates are almost always higher on corporate bonds, even for companies with top-flightcredit quality. The difference between the yields on highly-rated corporate bonds and U.S. Treasuries is called thecredit spread.\n\nBefore being issued to investors, bonds are reviewed for the creditworthiness of the issuer by one or more ofthree U.S. rating agencies: Standard & Poor's Global Ratings, Moody's Investor Services, and Fitch Ratings.\n\nEach has its own ranking system, but the highest-rated bonds are commonly referred to as \"Triple-A\" rated bonds. The lowest-rated corporate bonds are called high-yield bonds due to the greater interest rate applied to compensate for their higher risk. These are also known as\"junk\" bonds.\n\nBond ratings are vital to alerting investors to the quality and stability of the bond in question. These ratings consequently greatly influence interest rates, investment appetite, and bond pricing.\n\nCompanies with solvency problems, those trying to avoid bankruptcy, and those in reorganization might also offerincome bonds, usually at an above-average rate. Income bonds can raise money for the struggling company and are not required to pay coupons or dividend payments.\n\nCorporate bonds are issued in blocks of $1,000 in face or par value. Almost all have a standardcoupon payment structure. Typically a corporate issuer will enlist the help of an investment bank to underwrite and market the bond offering to investors.\n\nThe investor receives regular interest payments from the issuer until the bond matures. At that point, the investor reclaims the face value of the bond. The bonds may have a fixed interest rate or a rate that floats according to the movements of a particular economic indicator.\n\nCorporate bonds sometimes havecall provisionsto allow for early prepayment if prevailing interest rates change so dramatically that the company deems it can do better by issuing a new bond.\n\nInvestors may also opt to sell bonds before they mature. If a bond is sold, the owner gets less than face value. The amount it is worth is determined primarily by the number of payments that still are due before the bond matures.\n\nInvestors may also gain access to corporate bonds by investing in any number of bond-focused mutual funds or ETFs.\n\nCorporate bonds are a form ofdebt financing. They are a major source of capital for many businesses, along with equity, bank loans, and lines of credit. They often are issued to provide the ready cash for a particular project the company wants to undertake.\n\nDebt financing is sometimes preferable to issuing stock (equity financing) because it is typically cheaper for the borrowing firm and does not entail giving up any ownership stake or control in the company.\n\nGenerally speaking, a company needs to have consistent earnings potential to be able to offer debt securities to the public at a favorable coupon rate. If a company's perceived credit quality is higher, it can issue more debt at lower rates.\n\nWhen a corporation needs a very short-term capital boost, it may sell commercial paper, which is similar to a bond but typically matures in 270 days or less.\n\nA balanced portfolio may contain some bonds to offset riskier investments. The percentage devoted to bonds may grow as the investor approaches retirement.\n\nAn investor who buys a corporate bond is lending money to the company. An investor who buys stock is buying an ownership share of the company.\n\nThe value of a stock rises and falls, and the investor's stake rises or falls with it. The investor may make money by selling the stock when it reaches a higher price, by collecting dividends paid by the company, or both.\n\nBy investing in bonds, an investor is paid in interest rather than profits. The original investment can only be at risk if the company collapses. One important difference is that even a bankrupt company mustpay its bondholdersand other creditors first. Stock owners may be reimbursed for their losses only after all of those debts are paid in full.\n\nCompanies may also issueconvertible bonds, which are able to be turned into shares of the company if certain conditions are met.\n\nWhether corporate bonds are better than Treasury bonds will depend on the investor's financial profile and risk tolerance. Corporate bonds tend to pay higher interest rates because they carry more risk than government bonds. Corporations may be more likely to default than the U.S. government, hence the higher risk. Companies that have low-risk profiles will have bonds with lower rates than companies with higher-risk profiles.\n\nMost corporate bonds pay semi-annually; every six months; however, bonds can pay monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nNo, corporate bonds are not FDIC insured. They are an investment security rather than a deposit of your funds, hence, they are not FDIC insured like your checking account is.\n\nCompanies need money to run their businesses. Even if they generate enough money through their core operations, it can be financially prudent to raise outside money. Companies generally have two options of doing this: equity financing and debt financing.\n\nEquity financing is the issuance of stocks and debt financing includes the issuance of bonds. Corporate bonds allow companies to raise capital without giving up ownership and to operate more freely.\n\nFitch Ratings. \"Rating Definitions.\"\n\nMoody's. \"Rating Scale and Definitions,\" Page 1.\n\nS&P Global. \"S&P Global Ratings Definitions.\"",
