  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe sum-of-the-parts valuation (SOTP) is a process of valuing a company by determining what its aggregate divisions would be worth if they were spun off or acquired by another company.\n\nThe valuation provides a range of values for a company's equity by aggregating the standalone value of each of its business units and arriving at a singletotal enterprise value (TEV). The equity value is then derived by adjusting the company's net debt and othernon-operating assetsand expenses. Net debt = gross debt less cash and equivalents.\n\n\ufeffSOTP=N1+N2+\u2026+ND\u2212NL+NAwhere:N1=Value\u00a0of\u00a0first\u00a0segmentN2=Value\u00a0of\u00a0second\u00a0segmentND=net\u00a0debtNL=nonoperating\u00a0liabilities\\begin{aligned} &\\text{SOTP} = N_1 + N_2 + \\dotso + ND - NL + NA \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &N_1=\\text{Value of first segment}\\\\ &N_2=\\text{Value of second segment}\\\\ &ND=\\text{net debt}\\\\ &NL=\\text{nonoperating liabilities}\\\\ &NA = \\text{nonoperating assets} \\end{aligned}\u200bSOTP=N1\u200b+N2\u200b+\u2026+ND\u2212NL+NAwhere:N1\u200b=Value\u00a0of\u00a0first\u00a0segmentN2\u200b=Value\u00a0of\u00a0second\u00a0segmentND=net\u00a0debtNL=nonoperating\u00a0liabilities\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe value of each business unit or segment is derived separately and can be determined by any number of analysis methods. For example,discounted cash flow(DCF) valuations, asset-based valuations and multiples valuations using revenue, operating profit orprofit marginsare methods utilized to value a business segment.\n\nSum-of-the-parts valuation, also known asbreakup valueanalysis, helps a company understand its true value. For example, you might hear that a young technology company is \"worth more than the sum of its parts,\" meaning the value of the company's divisions could be worth more if they were sold to other companies.\n\nIn situations such as this one, larger companies have the ability to take advantage of synergies andeconomies of scaleunavailable to smaller companies, enabling them to maximize a division's profitability and unlock unrealized value.\n\nThe SOTP valuation is most commonly used to value a company comprised of business units in different industries since valuation methods differ across industries depending on the nature of revenue. It is possible to use this valuation to defend against a hostile takeover by proving the company is worth more as a sum of its parts. It is also possible to use this valuation in situations where a company is being revalued after arestructuring.\n\nThe Sum-of-the-parts valuation is also known as the breakup value as it assesses what individual segments would be worth if the company was broken up.\n\nConsider United Technologies (NYSE: UTX), which said it will break the company into three units in late 2018\u2014an aerospace, elevator and building systems company. Using the 10-year medianenterprise value-to-EBIT(EV/EBIT) multiple for peers and 2019 operating profit projections, the aerospace business is valued at $107 billion, the elevator business at $36 billion and building systems business $52 billion. Thus, the total value is $194 billion. Lessing out net debt and other items of $39 billion, the sum-of-the-parts valuation is $155 billion.\n\nWhile both are valuation tools, the SOTP valuation can incorporate a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation. That is, valuing a segment of a company may be done with a DCF analysis. Meanwhile, the DCF uses discounted future cash flows to value a business, project or segment. The present value of expected future cash flows is discounted using adiscount rate.\n\nThe sum-of-the-parts (SOTP) valuation involves valuing various business segments, and more valuations come with more inputs. As well, SOTP valuations do not take into account tax implications, notably the implications involved in a spinoff.\n\nFor help on choosing the right valuation tool check outthis guide to picking the right valuation method.",
