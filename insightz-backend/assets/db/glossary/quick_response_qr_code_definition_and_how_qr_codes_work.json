  "term": "Quick Response (QR) Code: Definition and How QR Codes Work",
  "definition": "A type of barcode that stores information and can be read by a digital device.\n\nA quick response (QR) code is a type of barcode that can be scanned by a digital device and that stores information as a series of pixels in a square-shaped grid. Unlike the pandemic-era masks, the QR codes that became ubiquitous during that period are almost sure to stay.QR codes bridge the physical and digital worlds, as people can scan menus and posters for information with their cellphones or off websites.\n\nBut QR codes are used to do more than tell you what appetizers are on special at your local restaurant. Inventory managers hope they gain wider use to track product information in thesupply chain, not just in marketing and advertising campaigns. QR codes are\u00a0considered an advance over the older, unidimensional\u00a0barcodes and were approved as an international standard in 2000 by theInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nBelow, we go through the basics of the QR code and why it has gained such wide use in recent years.\n\nQR codes were developed in the 1990s to provide more information than a standard barcode. They were invented by Denso Wave, a subsidiary of Toyota, as a way to track automobiles throughout the manufacturing process.Unlikebarcodes, which require a beam of light to bounce off the parallel lines, mobile phones can digitally scan QR codes.\n\nQR codes consist of black squares arranged in a grid (matrix) on a white background and are read by specialized software that can extract data from the patterns in the matrix.\u00a0These codes can contain more information than traditional barcodes and primarily handle four modes of data: alphanumeric, numeric, binary, and Kanji.\n\nDespite the greater capacity, QR codes have not proven as popular with consumers as was expected. Rather than being created by consumers to share information, they are most commonly associated withmarketingcampaigns.\n\nQR codes have become more widespread in facilitating digital payments andcryptocurrencysystems, such as displaying one\u2019s Bitcoin address. QR codes are also increasingly used to transmit web addresses to mobile phones. For instance, the QR code below encodes this webpage\u2019s URL on Investopedia.\n\nThe amount of information that can be conveyed about a product or service was traditionally limited by the amount of space on the product\u2019s packaging or the advertisement touting its benefits. If a consumer wanted more information about the product\u2014availability, price, attributes\u2014they would have to find a salesperson or request extra documentation.\n\nBarcodes are commonly found on the back of product packages and convey data using a combination of various widths of parallel lines, which can be read by machines that have an optical scanner.\n\nThe barcode revolutionized the way companies managedinventoriesand pricing and was first put to practical use in the 1960s by U.S. railroads to track equipment and containers. Traditional, two-dimensional barcodes came into common use in U.S. retail stores in 1974.Barcodes are now found on everything from employee ID badges and hospital bracelets to shipping containers. The impact of this humble set of lines is hard to overstate: Without them, the never-ending cascade of products cramming every aisle of our stores could not be inventoried and shipped with such relative ease.\n\nBarcodes are typically used when a simple identification is needed. Supermarkets use them to track product prices and inventory. Libraries use barcodes for book identification and checkouts. Shipping companies utilize barcodes to track packages throughout the delivery process.\n\nQR codes, meanwhile, are commonly used when a large amount of information needs to be shared. For instance, they are often found on event tickets to quickly provide details or on advertisements to link directly to a website. QR codes can also be used in restaurants, enabling customers to view digital menus by scanning the code.\n\nExperts envision even broader applications for QR codes in streamlining inventory and supply chains in the years ahead. Beyond encoding links to drink specials and website URLs, QR codes can store expansive amounts of data, opening possibilities like integrating detailed product information into codes. In the future, scanning a code could show everything from a product\u2019s manufacturing data to its transportation history to precise expiry dates.\n\nSome companies are even experimenting with using QR codes to tie digital information to individual products rather than entire product lines. With this level of precision, scannable QR codes could provide consumers assurance about the origins, ingredients, or components of the item they are purchasing. Supply chain managers are hopeful about efficiency improvements, too, if items can be traced to specific factories, batches, and delivery dates. As the possibilities expand, QR codes may radically change how data flows between physical products and digital systems, bridging digital life and the real world.\n\nUsed for sharing extensive information\n\nCommonly found on event tickets and ads\n\nEnable digital menu viewing in restaurants\n\nGaining wider use to track inventory in real time\n\nTrack prices and inventory in supermarkets\n\nAid in checkout and package tracking\n\nMany QR code types may be used for different items. Here are some:\n\nThe pandemic dramatically increased the use of QR codes, with a reported 25 times surge for restaurants and seven times surge for hotels as societies shifted toward touchless interactions.\n\nBusinesses in the hospitality sectors, like restaurants and bars, utilized QR codes for safe communication (such as digital menus, among many other use cases) and transactions.\n\nWhile paper menus returned, the use of QR codes continued post-pandemic. The pandemic demonstrated the adaptability and versatility of QR codes, suggesting their potential for use in various industries.\n\nNo, QR codes are not just black and white. They can be customized with different colors and designs.\n\nThe largest QR code was made on crop land in Indiana in 2022. U.S. brewery D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc. and Chalfant Family Farms made the code on a 1,721,344-square-foot area (about a quarter-mile long by a quarter-mile wide).\n\nNo, QR codes generally do not expire. Once created, they can be used indefinitely unless the linked information is changed or removed.\n\nWhile QR codes cannot carry viruses, they can link to malicious websites. Users should only scan QR codes from a trusted source.\n\nQR codes are intuitive to use with modern smartphones and mobile applications. Their advantages include increased customer engagement, more accessible access to information, and digital utility in areas like digital signage. However, potential cons include security concerns, as they can link to malicious websites and a gateway to a person\u2019s private information. Their use, already expansive in Asia, grew considerably in Europe and the United States during the pandemic and has remained widely used. Supply chain and efficiency managers see far broader applications for QR codes to track products in real time.\n\nDavies, Hugh, et al. \u201cQR Codes During the Pandemic: Seamful Quotidian Placemaking.\u201dConvergence, vol. 29, no. 5, April 2023.\n\nDenso Wave, QR Code. \u201cQR Code Standardization.\u201d\n\nDenso Wave. \u201cQR Code Development Team Becomes First Japanese Winner of European Inventor Award.\u201d\n\nElectronic Imaging Materials. \u201cBarcode History\u2014How Early Barcodes Changed Our Lives.\u201d\n\nThe Atlantic. \u201cThe Barcode Engineered Its Own Downfall.\u201d\n\nDenso Wave, QR Code. \u201cMicro QR Code.\u201d\n\nDenso Wave, QR Code. \u201cQR Code Model 1 Model 2.\u201d\n\nDenso Wave, QR Code. \u201ciQR Code.\u201d\n\nDenso Wave, QR Code. \u201cTypes of QR Code.\u201d\n\ndentsu X. \u201cThe Rise of QR Codes During COVID-19.\u201d\n\nMy QR Code. \u201cWhat Are the Biggest QR Codes Ever Made?\u201d",
