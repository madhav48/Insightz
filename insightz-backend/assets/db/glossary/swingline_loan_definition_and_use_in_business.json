  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA swingline loan is a short-term loan made by financial institutions that gives businesses access to funds to cover debt commitments. A swingline loan can be a sub-limit of an existingcredit facilityor asyndicatedcredit line, which is financing offered by a group of lenders. Swingline loans typically have short operating durations trangingfrom five to 15 days on average.\n\nSwingline loans are helpful to companies since they provide much-needed cash relatively quickly. However, swingline loans often carry higherinterest ratesthan traditional lines of credit, and the funds are limited to coveringdebtobligations.\n\nFinancial institutions make swingline loans to both businesses and individuals. A swingline loan for individuals is similar to apayday loan, providing cash quickly. However, fast access to credit comes at a cost in the form of a significantly higher interest rate than other forms of credit, such as bank-issued personal loans.\n\nCompanies can use swingline loans to cover temporary shortfalls incash flow, and in that sense, they are similar to otherlines of creditin how they function. However, the funds provided by this type of loan are meant to be used only for paying down existing debts. In other words, the funds cannot be used to expand the business, acquire new assets, or invest in research and development.\n\nThe limitation of the use of funds differentiates swingline loans from traditional lines of credit, which can be used for almost any purpose, including buying goods and debt repayments.\n\nSwingline loans can be tapped or drawn down on the same day a request is made to the lender and be issued for smaller amounts than the existing credit facility.\n\nA swingline loan can take the form ofrevolving credit, which is a line of credit that the borrower can repeatedly draw on and pay back. Though the loan normally has an upward limit, as long as the funds are paid back as agreed, they can be withdrawn on short notice. Often, borrowers can receive funds on the same day they are requested, and the cycle ofrepaymentandwithdrawalcan continue as long as all the borrowing conditions are met and both parties choose to keep the line open.\n\nRevolving credit lines, including swingline loans, can be closed at the discretion of either the borrower or the lender. Lenders have the option to close any line of credit that they consider to be too risky. Swingline loans are best suited for use in cases where normal processing delays make other forms of loans impractical.\n\nAs with any borrowing facility, each credit product has pros and cons. Company executives must weigh the benefits and drawbacks to determine whether a swingline loan is viable.\n\nA swingline loan can give the borrower access to a large sum of cash.\n\nSwingline loans can be accessed on very short notice.\n\nSwingline loans help companies with cash flow shortfalls and keep their debt payments current.\n\nSwingline loans need to be repaid quickly.\n\nSwingline loans often carry higher interest rates than traditional lines of credit.\n\nThe use of funds from swingline loans is often limited to paying debt obligations.\n\nA swingline loan is a type of loan for business owners or individuals to access a large sum of credit for a brief period of time. They are often a sub-limit of a revolving line of credit.\n\nUses for swingline loans are typically limited to paying debt obligations.\n\nYes. The cycle of repayment and withdrawal on a swingline loan can continue indefinitely as long as all the borrowing conditions are met and neither party chooses to close the line.\n\nSwingline loans can be made to both businesses and individuals and provide fast access to a large amount of cash. However, these loans can come with significantly higher interest rates than other forms of credit, such as personal loans.
