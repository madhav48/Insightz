  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nOperational efficiency is primarily a metric that measures the efficiency of profit earned as a function ofoperating costs.\u00a0The greater the operational efficiency, the more profitable a firm or investment is. This is because the entity is able to generate greater income or returns for the same or lower cost than an alternative.\n\nInfinancial markets, operational efficiency occurs when transaction costs and fees are reduced. An operationally efficient market may also be known as an \"internally efficient market.\"\n\nOperational efficiency in the investment markets is typically centered aroundtransaction costsassociated with investments. Operational efficiency in the investment markets can be compared to general business practices for operational efficiency in production. Operationally efficient transactions are those that are exchanged with the highest margin, meaning an investor pays the lowest fee to earn the highest profit.\n\nSimilarly, companies seek to earn the highestgross margin profitfrom their products by manufacturing goods at the lowest cost. In nearly all cases, operational efficiency can be improved byeconomies of scale. In the investment markets, this can mean buying more shares of an investment at a fixed trading cost to reduce the fee per share.\n\nA market is reported to be operationally efficient when conditions exist allowing participants to execute transactions and receive services at a price that equates fairly to the actual costs required to provide them.\n\nOperationally efficient markets are typically a byproduct of competition. Operationally efficient markets may also be influenced by regulation that works to cap fees in order to protect investors against exorbitant costs.\n\nOperationally efficient markets can help to improve the overall efficiency of investment portfolios. Greater operational efficiency in the investment markets means capital can be allocated without excessive frictional costs that reduce therisk/rewardprofile of an investment portfolio.\n\nInvestment fundsare also analyzed by their comprehensive operational efficiency. A fund\u2019sexpense ratiois one metric for determining operational efficiency. A number of factors influence the expense ratio of a fund: transaction costs, management fees, and administrative expenses. Comparatively, funds with a lower expense ratio are generally considered to be more operationally efficient.\n\nProductivityserves as a measurement of output, normally expressed as some units per amount of time\u2014for example, 100 units per hour.Efficiencyin production most often relates to the costs per unit of production rather than just the number of units produced.\n\nProductivity versus efficiency can also involve analysis of economies of scale. Entities seek to optimize production levels in order to achieve efficient economies of scale, which then helps to lower per-unit costs and increase per-unit returns.\n\nFunds with greaterassets under management(AUM) can obtain greater operational efficiency because of the higher number of shares transacted per trade.\n\nGenerally,passive investmentfunds are typically known to have greater operational efficiency than active funds based on their expense ratios. Passive funds offer targeted market exposure through index replication. Large funds have the advantage of economies of scale in trading. For passive funds, following the holdings of an index also incurs lower transaction costs.\n\nIn other areas of the market, certain structural or regulatory changes can make participation more operationally efficient. In 2000, theCommodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) passed a resolution allowingmoney market fundsto be considered eligible margin requirements\u2014prior to this only cash was eligible. This minor change reduced unnecessary costs of trading\u00a0in and out\u00a0of money market funds, making thefutures marketsmore operationally efficient.\n\nFinancial regulators have also imposed an 8.5%sales chargecap on mutual fund commissions.This cap helps to improve operational trading efficiency and investment profits for individual investors.\n\nCommodity Futures Trading Commission. \"History of the CFTC.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"2341.
