  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nFinancial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) is a movement of people devoted to a program of extreme savings and investment with the goal of retiring far earlier than traditional budgets and retirement plans would permit.\n\nThe 1992 best-selling bookYour Money or Your Lifeby Vicki Robin and Joe Dominguez popularized many of the concepts used by people in this movement. The origins of the term and acronym FIRE are unknown, but the term came to embody a core premise of the book:\u00a0People should evaluate every expense in terms of the number of working hours it took to pay for it.\n\nThe FIRE movement prioritizes greater financial independence through a program of extreme frugality and aggressive investment. FIRE devotees may hope to retire earlier than the conventional retirement age range of 65 to 70, or they may hope to gain greater financial independence. Those who want to retire early may plan to live solely off small withdrawals from theirportfoliosor they may incorporate part-time work into their strategy.\n\nProponents of the extreme-saving lifestyle remain in the workforce for several years, saving up to 75% of their yearly income.When their savings reach their FIRE number, typically 25 times their yearly expenses, they may quit their day jobs or retire from work altogether.\n\nTo cover their living expenses afterretiring at a young age, FIRE devotees make small withdrawals from their savings, typically around 3% to4% of the balanceyearly (adjusted for inflation). Depending on the size of their savings and their desired lifestyle, this requires extreme diligence to monitor expenses and dedication to themaintenance and reallocationof their investments.\n\nThere are several FIRE retirement variations:\n\nIn recent years, the FIRE movement has started getting more coverage in the media. However, only a small percentage of people achieve the early retirement part of the equation.\n\nAccording to Motley Fool data gathered between 2016 and 2022, here is the percentage of Americans who are retired in four age brackets:\n\nFurthermore, Gallup research shows that the percentage of retired adults between the ages of 55 and 74 is declining. The average reported retirement age was 61 in 2022\u2014earlier than the plan for future retirees but still far later than most FIRE goals.\n\nInYour Money or Your Life,author Vicki Robin says that FIRE is not just about retiring early; instead, it teaches you how to consume less while living better.\n\nWhether you want to retire early or gain more financial independence while continuing to work,the FIRE lifestylerequires planning. Here are some things to keep in mind before making the leap.\n\nBefore taking further steps, save three to six month's worth of expenses. That's how much many experts advise keeping in anemergency fund.Your savings should be able to tide you over during employment, unexpected expenses, or other unforeseen issues.\n\nYou won't reach FIRE just by putting your money in the bank, even if you choose ahigh-yield savings account. However, that doesn't mean that you should be reckless when choosing investments. Start by maxing out any employer-sponsoredretirement savingsplans. Then consider contributing to atraditional or Roth IRA.\n\nAs of 2024, individuals can contribute $23,000 to an employer-sponsored plan like a 401(k), plus a catch-up contribution of $7,500 if they're aged 50 or older. IRA holders can deposit $7,000, plus a catch-up contribution of $8,000 if they're at least 50 years old.\n\nThe Rule of 25 used by many FIRE participants depends on a 4% maximum portfolio withdrawal rate (adjusted for inflation). However, many experts question the validity of the 4% guideline, especially for folks who plan to retire early.\n\nIn addition, keep in mind that you'll pay a penalty if you withdraw funds from a 401(k), IRA, or similar retirement plan before the age of 59\u00bd.FIRE plans that depend on early access to these funds may be not be sustainable.\n\nThe acronym FIRE stands for Financial Independence, Retire Early. It's a movement that prioritizes cutting expenses, saving, and investing with the goal of retiring early or gaining more financial freedom.\n\nFollowers of FIRE plan to retire much earlier than the traditional retirement age of 65 by dedicating up to 75% of their income to savings while still in the full-time workforce. When their savings reach approximately 25 times their yearly expenses, they may quit their day jobs or completely retire from any form of employment.\n\nWithin the FIRE movement are several variations. Fat FIRE attempts to save more while giving up less. Lean FIRE requires devotion to minimalist living. Barista FIRE is for those who want to quit the 9-to-5 rat race and are willing to cut back their spending while working only part-time.\n\nThe 4% rule states how much you can withdraw from your nest egg the first year of retirement. Every subsequent year is that amount, adjusted forinflation. For example, let's say your nest egg for you and your spouse is $2 million. The first year of retirement, you would be able to withdraw a maximum of $80,000. The next year, if inflation was at 3%, you would withdraw $82,400.\n\nThe FIRE movement was inspired by the bookYour Money or Your Life : 9 Steps to Transforming Your Relationship with Money and Achieving Financial Independenceby Vicki Robin, Joseph Dominguez, and Monique Tilford.\n\nOne positive thing about FIRE is that you can adjust the details to fit your particular situation. And there are several variations, from Fat FIRE to Lean FIRE. However, there are a few downsides, as well. The aggressive savings rate may not be realistic for some people, especially those who are taking care of children or older parents. And inflation or abear marketbefore you want to retire could make that goal difficult, forcing you to adjust your plans.\n\nThe Financial Independence, Retire Early (FIRE) movement offers an alternative approach to traditional retirement planning. Instead of aiming to retire at 65, many FIRE participants target an earlier retirement age. Others plan to stay in the workforce but hope to achieve financial independence, which means depending less on a regular paycheck from a full-time job.\n\nIf you want to pursue FIRE, you'll need to plan carefully. Keep in mind that the common retirement guidelines are intended for people who will be out of the workforce for only 30 years or so. Consider speaking with a financial planner to adjust your goals and strategies.\n\nThe New York Times. \"Your Neighbors Are Retiring in Their 30s.
