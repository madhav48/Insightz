  "term": "What is EMA? How to Use Exponential Moving Average With Formula",
  "definition": "An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type ofmoving average (MA)that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentiallyweightedmoving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving averagesimple moving average (SMA), which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.\n\n\ufeffEMAToday=(ValueToday\u2217(Smoothing1+Days))where:\\begin{aligned} &\\begin{aligned} EMA_{\\text{Today}}=&\\left(\\text{Value}_{\\text{Today}}\\ast\\left(\\frac{\\text{Smoothing}}{1+\\text{Days}}\\right)\\right)\\\\ &+EMA_{\\text{Yesterday}}\\ast\\left(1-\\left(\\frac{\\text{Smoothing}}{1+\\text{Days}}\\right)\\right)\\end{aligned}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &EMA=\\text{Exponential moving average} \\end{aligned}\u200bEMAToday\u200b=\u200b(ValueToday\u200b\u2217(1+DaysSmoothing\u200b))\u200bwhere:\u200b\ufeff\n\nWhile there are many possible choices for the smoothing factor, the most common choice is:\n\nThat gives the most recent observation more weight. If the smoothing factor is increased, more recent observations have more influence on the EMA.\n\nCalculating the EMArequires one more observation than the SMA. Suppose that you want to use 20 days as the number of observations for the EMA. Then, you must wait until the 20th day to obtain the SMA. On the 21st day, you can then use the SMA from the previous day as the first EMA for yesterday.\n\nThe calculation for the SMA is straightforward. It is simply the sum of the stock's closing prices during a time period, divided by the number of observations for that period. For example, a 20-day SMA is just the sum of the closing prices for the past 20 trading days, divided by 20.\n\nNext, you must calculate the multiplier for smoothing (weighting) the EMA, which typically follows the formula: [2 \u00f7 (number of observations + 1)]. For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)]= 0.0952.\n\nFinally, the following formula is used to calculate the current EMA:\n\nThe EMA gives a higher weight to recent prices, while the SMA assigns equal weight to all values. The weighting given to the most recent price is greater for a shorter-period EMA than for a longer-period EMA.For example, an 18.18% multiplier is applied to the most recent price data for a 10-period EMA, while the weight is only 9.52% for a 20-period EMA.\n\nThere are also slight variations of the EMA arrived at by using the open, high, low, or median price instead of using the closing price.\n\nThe 12- and 26-day exponential moving averages (EMAs) are often the most quoted and analyzed short-term averages. The 12- and 26-day are used to create indicators like themoving average convergence divergence (MACD)and thepercentage price oscillator (PPO).In general, the 50- and 200-day EMAs are used as indicators for long-term trends.When a stock price crosses its 200-day moving average, it is a technical signal that areversalhas occurred.\n\nTraders who employtechnical analysisfind moving averages very useful and insightful when applied correctly. However, they also realize that these signals can create havoc when used improperly or misinterpreted. All the moving averages commonly used in technical analysis arelagging indicators.\n\nConsequently, the conclusions drawn from applying a moving average to a particular market chart should be to confirm a market move or indicate its strength. The optimal time to enter the market often passes before a moving average shows that the trend has changed.\n\nAn EMA does serve to alleviate the negative impact of lags to some extent. Because the EMA calculation places more weight on the latest data, it \u201chugs\u201d the price action a bit more tightly and reacts more quickly. This is desirable when an EMA is used to derive a trading entry signal.\n\nLike all moving average indicators, EMAs are much better suited fortrending markets. When the market is in a strong and sustained uptrend, theEMA indicator linewill also show an uptrend and vice-versa for a downtrend. A vigilant trader will pay attention to both the direction of the EMA line and the relation of therate of changefrom one bar to the next. For example, suppose the price action of a strong uptrend begins to flatten and reverse. From anopportunity costpoint of view, it might be time to switch to a more bullish investment.\n\nEMAs are commonly used in conjunction with other indicators to confirm significant market moves and to gauge their validity. For traders who tradeintradayand fast-moving markets, the EMA is more applicable. Quite often, traders use EMAs to determine a trading bias. If an EMA on adaily chartshows a strong upward trend, an intraday trader\u2019s strategy may be to trade only on the long side.\n\nThe majordifference between an EMA and an SMAis the sensitivity each one shows to changes in the data used in its calculation.\n\nMore specifically, the EMA gives higher weights to recent prices, while the SMA assigns equal weights to all values. The two averages are similar because they are interpreted in the same manner and are both commonly used by technical traders to smooth out price fluctuations.\n\nSince EMAs place a higher weighting on recent data than on older data, they are more responsive to the latestprice changesthan SMAs. That makes the results from EMAs more timely and explains why they are preferred by many traders.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not more emphasis should be placed on the most recent days in the time period. Many traders believe that new data better reflects the current trend of the security. At the same time, others feel that overweighting recent dates creates a bias that leads to more false alarms.\n\nSimilarly, the EMA relies wholly on historical data. Many economists believe thatmarkets are efficient, which means that current market prices already reflect all available information. If markets are indeed efficient, using historical data should tell us nothing about the future direction of asset prices.\n\nThe longer-day EMAs (i.e. 50 and 200-day) tend to be used more by long-term investors, while short-term investors tend to use 8- and 20-day EMAs.\n\nThe EMA focused more on recent price moves, which means it tends to respond more quickly to price changes than the SMA.\n\nInvestors tend to interpret a rising EMA as a support to price action and a falling EMA as a resistance. With that interpretation, investors look to buy when the price is near the rising EMA and sell when the price is near the falling EMA.\n\nSteve Nison. \"Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques, 2nd Edition,\" Page 219.
