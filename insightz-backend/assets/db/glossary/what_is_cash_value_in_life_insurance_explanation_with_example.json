  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nCash value life insurance is a form ofpermanent life insurance\u2014lasting for the lifetime of the holder\u2014that features a cash value savings component. The policyholder can use the cash value for many purposes, including borrowing or withdrawing cash from it, or using it to pay policy premiums.\n\nCash value insurance is permanent life insurance because it provides coverage for the policyholder\u2019s life. Usually, cash value life insurance has higher premiums thanterm life insurancebecause of the cash value element. A portion of each premium payment is allocated to the cost of insurance and the remainder deposited into a cash value account.\n\nThe cash value of life insurance earns interest, and taxes are deferred on the accumulated earnings.While premiums are paid and interest accrues,the cash value builds over time. As the life insurance cash value increases, the insurance company\u2019s risk decreases, because the accumulated cash value offsets part of the insurer\u2019s liability.\n\nConsider a policy with a $25,000 death benefit. The policy has no outstanding loans or prior cash withdrawals and an accumulated cash value of $5,000. Upon the death of the policyholder, the insurance company pays the full death benefit of $25,000. Money accumulated in the cash value becomes the property of the insurer.\n\nBecause the cash value is $5,000, the real liability cost to the life insurance company is $20,000 ($25,000 \u2013 $5,000).\n\nWhole life,variable life, anduniversal lifeinsurance are all examples of cash value life insurance. Term insurance is not cash value insurance.\n\nThe cash value componentserves as a living benefit for policyholdersfrom which they may access funds. There are several ways to do that.\n\nFor most policies, partialsurrendersor withdrawals are permissible, though these reduce the death benefit. Some policies allow for unlimited withdrawals, while others restrict how many draws can be taken during a term or calendar year. Some policies limit the amounts available for removal (e.g., a maximum of $500).\n\nIf you withdraw more than the amount you\u2019ve paid into the cash value, that portion will be taxed as ordinary income.\n\nMost cash value life insurance arrangements allow forpolicy loansfrom the cash value. As with any other loan, the issuer will charge interest on the outstanding principal. The outstanding loan amount will reduce the death benefit dollar for dollar in the event of the death of the policyholder before full repayment of the loan.\n\nCash value may also be used to pay policy premiums. If there is a sufficient amount, a policyholder can stop paying premiums out of pocket and have the cash value account cover the payment.\n\nPolicyholders of permanent life insurance have the ability to borrow against the accumulated cash value, which comes from regular premium payments plus any interest and dividends credited to the policy.\n\nThose looking to build a nest egg over a time horizon of several decades may want to consider cash value life insurance as a savings option, alongside a retirement plan like an IRA or 401(k). Be aware that cash values often don't begin accruing until two to five years have passed.And you may have to wait several years to access the cash value, or pay a penalty.\n\nYes, cash value policy premiums are typically higher than regular life insurance because part of your payment goes toward savings.\n\nIf you make a withdrawal from the cash value in a life insurance policy, the death benefit will decrease. If you withdraw everything, the policy terminates.\n\nWithdrawing money from life insurance is tax-advantaged in that the IRS considers your withdrawals a return of the premiums you paid for the policy. So you can withdraw that amount of money without paying taxes. Any gains from dividends or interest, however, would be taxed\u2014but these would not occur until after you've withdrawn all your premium payments.\n\nCash value life insurance provides a mechanism for policyholders to accumulate funds for future use. A portion of each premium is deposited into an interest-bearing savings account and the cash value grows tax-free over the lifetime of the deposit. This cash can be accessed for a variety of purposes during the insured\u2019s lifetime.\n\nAllstate. \u201cWhat Is Cash Value Life Insurance?\u201d\n\nFidelity. \"Cash Value Life Insurance.\"\n\nPrudential. \u201cA Guide to Life Insurance Dividends Options.\u201d",
