  "definition": "Golden handcuffs are a collection of financial incentives that are intended to encourage employees to remain with a company for a stipulated period of time. Golden handcuffs are offered by employers to existingkey employeesas a means of holding onto them as well as to increase employee retention rates. Golden handcuffs are common in industries where highly-compensated employees are likely to move from one company to another.\n\nEmployers invest significant resources in the hiring, training, and retaining of key employees. Golden handcuffs are intended to help employers hold onto employees that they've invested in, but also to ensure that their best employees and top performers do not leave the firm. Sometimes golden handcuffs have a negative connotation as they are often associated with individuals staying at a job they are not happy in, but not willing to leave because the financial loss would be significant.\n\nGolden handcuffs can take many different forms, includingstock options,supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs), large bonuses, vacation homes, a company car, and insurance policies. Typically, they are offered on a graduated basis when employees meet certain milestones, or they can be offered all at once with certain stipulations.\n\nWhen these incentives are offered, they come with certain terms. Usually, they state that bonuses or other forms of compensation are only paid out if the employee stays for a defined period of time. Or, if they are paid out up front, then they must be returned to the company if the employee leaves before a certain date.\n\nOther forms of golden handcuffs include contractual obligations that specify an action that an employee may or may not perform, such as a contract prohibiting a network television host from appearing on a competing channel.\n\nGolden handcuffs can involve different forms of financial incentives and legal clauses.\n\nCharles has been working for company XYZ for five years. In those five years, the company has spent a significant amount of time and money in training and developing Charle's skill set. Within that same time frame, Charles has demonstrated his exceptional talent and ability to perform well for the company. Not only has the cost in training Charles been returned to the company many times over due to his work ethic, but he will be a remarkable asset to the firm for many years to come.\n\nBecause Charles is such an exceptional employee, XYZ is worried they may lose him to a competitor who may offer more money or other incentives. To prevent this from happening, XYZ offers Charles a significant financial incentive throughemployee stock options. However, the stock options do notvestfor five years, ensuring Charles will stay with the company for those five years and not miss out on a significant cash windfall.\n\nTo incentivize high-performing employees to stay at a company, employers will use a golden handcuff strategy, which may take the form of employee stock options, bonuses, and/or a company car, among other perks that are supplemental to their base salary.\n\nThis retention strategy is designed to discourage employees from leaving the company and provide the conditions that encourage the best employees to stay.\n\nWhile the golden handcuffs strategy has long been used by employers to retain top employees, it comes with both benefits and drawbacks. While the additional perks, such as large bonuses, illustrate the company's appreciation for its employees' hard work and specialized skills, it may also come with greater expectations. These expectations may mean that the employee works long hours under significant pressure in order to meet company targets, which could wear on both mental and physical health.\n\nGolden handcuffs are an employee retention tool that motivates top performers to remain working for the company. They may be offered large bonuses, employee stock options, and other benefits. By comparison, a golden parachute is an agreement provided to company executives that offers them significant benefits if they are fired in the event of a merger or acquisition.\n\nMany companies, from Amazon and Meta to banking and consulting firms, use a golden handcuffs strategy to retain top employees by offering substantial benefits that go beyond their base salary. These benefits can be structured gradually over the course of time if an employee meets certain targets, or stays with a company for a certain amount of time. They can also be provided up front, but must be returned when the employee leaves the company, such as giving back a company car.\n\nWhile these perks can significantly boost employees' income, they can come with many drawbacks, such as long work hours, high stress, and burn-out, in order to reach the targets laid out in these agreements.\n\nBBC. \"For High-Earning Workers, It's Hard to Break Free From 'Golden Handcuffs.'\"\n\nFacet. \"Breaking Free From Golden Handcuffs: Navigating High-Reward Employment Traps.\"",
