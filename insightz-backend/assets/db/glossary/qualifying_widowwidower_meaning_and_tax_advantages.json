The surviving spouse may file jointly with the deceased spouse for thetax yearin which the spouse has died, and they can claim the standard deduction for a married couple filing jointly.\n\nFor the next two tax years, the surviving spouse can file as a qualifying widow or widower if they maintain a household for the couple\u2019s dependent children.\n\nThe qualifying widow or widower tax filing status is not available in the year of the spouse\u2019s death.

The qualifying widow or widower can enjoy the samestandard deductionamount as married couples filing jointly, and, as of 2018, qualifying widows and widowers enjoy the sametax bracketas married couples filing jointly. This gives widowed spouses two years to transition financially to the higher tax burden of a single, unmarried filer.\n\nFor example, if the deceased spouse passed away in 2023, the surviving spouse can use the qualifying widow or widower status to enjoy married filing jointly standard deductions and tax brackets for the tax years 2024 and 2025.\n\nLowertaxesare especially helpful when the surviving spouse is paying funeral costs, final expenses, and general expenses associated with maintaining a home and rearing children. The reduced tax burden makes it easier for a surviving spouse to continue to provide for their children, and to transition to a single, unmarried filer, or head of household status.\n\nIn addition, if the qualifying dependent is born or dies during the year, a taxpayer may still file under the qualified widow or widower status. Again, they must have paid more than one-half of the costs of maintaining the home during the child\u2019s life, or before the child\u2019s birth. Also, the child must have lived with the qualifying taxpayer during the year.\n\nThe federal qualifying widow or widower tax filing status is available for two years for widows and widowers (surviving spouses) with dependents after their spouse\u2019s death.\n\nAn individual may pay less in federalincome taxeswhen filing as a qualifying widow or widower.\n\nNo. To qualify, the spouse must have qualified for the married filing jointly status in the year of the spouse\u2019s death.\n\nThe federal qualifying widow or widower tax filing status is available for two years for widows and widowers (surviving spouses) with dependents after their spouse\u2019s death.
