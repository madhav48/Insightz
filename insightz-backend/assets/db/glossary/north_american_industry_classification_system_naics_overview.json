  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe North American Industry Classification System\u00a0(NAICS) is a business classification system\u00a0developed through a partnership among\u00a0the United States, Canada, and Mexico. This classification system facilitates\u00a0the comparison of statistics of all business activities across North America.Companies are classified and separated into industries that are defined by\u00a0the same or similar production processes. This system should not be confused with theNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)or theNational Association of Investors Corp. (NAIC).\n\nThe NAICS was established to replace and modernize the U.S.Standard Industrial Classificationsystem. The new system enables easier comparison\u00a0of all countries in North America.To ensure\u00a0the NAICS continues to be relevant, there is a planned\u00a0system review every five years.\n\nThe NAICS is a collaborative effort. The three parties responsible for the formation and continued maintenance of the NAICS are the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia in Mexico, Statistics Canada, and the United States Office of Management and Budget\u00a0through its Economic Classification Policy Committee, staffed by theBureau of Economic Analysis,Bureau of Labor Statistics,\u00a0and the Census Bureau.\n\nThe first version of the classification system was released in 1997. A revision in 2002 included substantial changes to\u00a0the construction, wholesale trade, retail trade, and information sectors.In 2012, there was a slight\u00a0reduction in\u00a0the number of industries in the system and modifications were made to some of the system\u2019s sector classifications.The latest revision, which occurred in 2022,\u00a0reduced the number of industries from 1,057 to 1,012. Changes in size standards were also included in the revision, with seven sectors of industries affected.\n\nThe NAICS classification system allows for more flexibility than the four-digit structure of the SIC.It uses a hierarchical six-digit coding system, classifying all economic activity into 20 different industry sectors. Five of these sectors are primarily those that produce goods while\u00a0the remaining 15 sectors provide some type of service. Every company receives a primary NAICS code, indicating its main line of business. This primary code is determined by the code definition\u00a0that generates the largest revenue for a\u00a0company at a specified location in the past year.\n\nNAICS codes are narrowed from 20 sector codes into 96 three-digit subsector\u00a0codes, further divided into 308 four-digit industry codes, subdivided into 689 five-digit industry codes, and ultimately broken down into 1,012 six-digit NAICS\u00a0codes.\n\nThe first two digits of a\u00a0NAICS code indicate the largest business sector in which a company operates.\u00a0The third digit designates the company\u2019s subsector, and the fourth digit indicates theindustry groupto which the company belongs. The fifth digit of the code reflects the company\u2019s particular industry of operation. The sixth and final digit designates\u00a0the company\u2019s specific national industry.Soybean farming, for example, has the NAICS code 111110, which is broken down to sector 11, subsector 111, industry group 1111, industry 11111, NAICS\u00a0code 111110.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"Introduction to NAICS.\"\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs), 12.
