  "term": "What Does Ltd. (Limited) Mean After a Business Name?",
  "definition": "Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nLtd. is a standard abbreviation for \"limited,\" a form of corporate structure available in countries like the U.K., Ireland, and Canada.\n\nLtd. is a standard abbreviation for \"limited,\" a corporate structure available in members of the Commonwealth, including the U.K., Ireland, and Canada. The term appears as a suffix that follows the company name, indicating that it is a private or publiclimited company. In a limited company, owners' and shareholders' liabilities are limited to the capital they originally invested. If such a company becomes insolvent, the owners' personal assets remain protected because the business is a legal entity and liable for its debts.\n\nA limited company is its own legal entity. A private limited company has one or more members, also called shareholders or owners, who buy in through private sales. Directors are company employees who keep up with all administrative tasks and tax filings but do not need to be shareholders.\n\nThe company's finances are separate from the owners' finances and are taxed separately. Thecompanyowns all profits, pays taxes on them, distributes a portion to shareholders as dividends (if applicable), and retains the rest asworking capital. A director may withdraw funds only for a salary, dividend payment, or loan.\n\nLimited companies are an organizational form that features limited liability, similar to corporations in the U.S.\n\nYou'll need the following to set up a limited company.\n\nOnce you have these together, you can then register as a private limited company.\n\nLimited company structures are common worldwide and are codified in many nations, though the regulations governing them can differ widely from one country to the next. For example, in the United Kingdom, there are private limited companies and public limited companies.\n\nPrivate limited companies are not permitted to offer shares to the public. They are, however, the most popular structures for a small business.\n\nPublic limited companies (PLCs)may offer shares to the public to raise capital, thoughstock can be unlisted, as well. Those shares may trade on a stock exchange once a total share value threshold is met (at least \u00a350,000). The mandatory use of the PLC abbreviation after the company's name serves to instantly signal that the company is public (and probably fairly large).\n\nThey are required to publish details about their financial health so shareholders (current and future) can size up the true worth of the stock and the risks associated with holding it.\n\nAll companies listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) are public limited companies (PLCs).\n\nIn the United States, a corporation is similar to a limited company, using the suffix Inc. (incorporated) or Corp. (corporation).\u00a0Some states in the U.S. do permit the use of Ltd.\u00a0(limited) after a company name.\n\nThese designations depend on filing the correct paperwork. Just adding the suffix to a company name does not provide any liability protection. Limited companies in the U.S. are required to file corporate taxes annually with regulators.\n\nLimited liability companies (LLCs)and limited companies have different structures.\n\nMany countries differentiate between public and private limited companies. For example, in Germany, the Aktiengesellschaft (AG) designation is for public limited companies that can sell shares to the public, while GmbH is for private limited companies that cannot issue public shares.\n\nBecause the number of shareholders is unlimited, ownership is spread among multiple owners rather than just one.\n\nAlso, shareholders only lose as much as they have invested if the company becomes insolvent.\n\nFor example, say a limited company issues 100 shares valued at $150 each. Shareholder A and Shareholder B paid in full for 25 shares each. If the company becomes insolvent, the maximum amount Shareholder A and Shareholder B each lose is $3,750, the value of the 25 shares each member holds.\n\nA limited company has greater tax advantages than asole proprietorship, partnership, or similar organization because the owners are not personally responsible for paying taxes\u2014the company, as a legal entity, is. The company continues to exist if an owner sells or transfers their shares as long as it has other shareholders and remains profitable and operational.\n\nWhen shares are sold privately, the amount of capital raised might be restricted. This also restricts any opportunity for growth a company might want because the pool of investors is limited. In contrast, offering shares to the public opens up the possibility of much more funding.\n\nThe costs for setting up a limited company are generally higher than those of sole traders (in the U.K.) and sole proprietorships (in the U.S.). These entities are small businesses that are only required to register to conduct business, thus incurring much lower costs.\n\nIn the U.K., both public and private companies have to file financial statements that are available to the public. This is different to the U.S., where private companies' financial statements are, indeed, private. There are disadvantages to having your company's financial statements publicly available, not least because your competitors can find out a lot about your business. There is some relief from these rules for smaller limited companies in the U.K., which are allowed to file abbreviated accounts that do not show much information.\n\nRunning a business as a limited company is a time-consuming process that requires the owners to follow accounting principles, tax filing requirements, administration requirements, and strict employee regulations regarding benefits.\n\nOwnership is diversified among shareholders\n\nPrivately sold shares limit capital raising\n\nStricter accounting and administrative requirements\n\nLimited liability companies (LLCs, found in the U.S.) and limited companies (Ltd., found in members of the Commonwealth, including the U.K.) are two different types of business structures.\n\nLLCs are unincorporated business entities, while limited companies are incorporated in their jurisdictions. Key differences in their jurisdictions stipulate the different rules regarding ownership, liability, taxes, and dividends.\n\nThe pros of a limited liability company (LLC), which is a U.S.-based legal entity that is different from a limited company, include the protection of personal assets by legally separating the owner's personal assets from their business assets, pass-through taxation, and easier tax filing. The cons include being more costly to set up and maintain than a general partnership or sole proprietorship, more difficult to transfer ownership, and typically higher taxes.\n\nBusinesses incorporate themselves as Ltd. (limited) to limit their liability to the capital they invest. If the business cannot pay its liabilities and declares bankruptcy,creditorscan only go after business assets, not the owner's personal assets.\n\nLtd. (limited) structured corporations provide owners with a degree of financial protection, limiting recourse to only the amount invested in the business while keeping their personal assets safe. This type of abbreviation is commonly used in members of the Commonwealth, including the U.K., and not in the U.S. In the U.S., a similar type of company is an incorporated business.\n\nGov.uk. \"Running a Limited Company: Your Responsibilities.\"\n\nGov.uk. \"Set Up a Limited Company: Step by Step.\"\n\nLegislation.gov.uk. \"Companies Act 2006.\"\n\nNIBusinessInfo.co.uk. \"Legal Structures for Businesses - An Overview.\"\n\nLondon Stock Exchange. \"UK and European Securities.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 1120,\" Page 2.",
