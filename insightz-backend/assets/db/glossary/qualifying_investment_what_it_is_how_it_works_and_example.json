Funds used to purchase qualified investments do not become subject to taxation until theinvestorwithdraws them.\n\nQualifying investments provide an incentive for individuals to contribute to certain types of savings accounts by deferring taxes until the investor withdraws the funds. Contributions to qualified accounts reduce an individual\u2019staxable incomein a given year, making the investment more attractive than a similar investment in a non-qualified account.\n\nFor high-incomeindividuals, deferring taxation on earnings until the distribution from a retirement fund could potentially yield savings in a couple of ways. For example, consider a married couple whose gross income would push them just over the break-point to a highertax bracket.\n\nIn 2024, a married couple filing jointly will see a rise in tax rate from 24% to 32% on earnings over $383,900. Because theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) usesmarginal tax rates, the couple\u2019s 2023 earnings between $201,050 and $383,900 would be taxed at 24%.Fortax year2025, the couple\u2019s earnings window rises to between $206,700 and $394,600.\n\nSuppose each spouse\u2019s employer offered a401(k)plan, and the couple maxed out their contributions for the year. The contribution limit established by the IRS caps annual contributions to 401(k) plans in 2024 at $23,000 each. So, the couple could trim $46,000 in total off their 2024 taxable income, bringing the total number down from $383,900 to $337,900, comfortably within the 24% tax bracket.\n\nIf the couple had needed to make an additional contribution and they were over the age of 50, they are each allowed by the IRS to make acatch-up contributionof $8,000 in 2024.This amount remains the same in 2025.\n\nAfter retirement, the taxes the couple will pay on distributions will correspond to their post-retirement income, which likely will be quite a bit less than their combined salaries. To the extent their retirement distributions stay below the threshold for higher-income tax brackets, they will profit off the difference between the marginal rates they would have paid in the present and any lower marginal rates they pay in the future.\n\nInvestments qualifying for tax-deferred status typically include annuities, stocks, bonds, IRAs,Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSPs), and certain types of trusts.Traditional IRAsand variants geared toward self-employed people, such asSEPandSIMPLE IRAplans, all fall under the category of qualifying investments.\n\nRoth\u00a0IRAs,on the other hand, operate a bit differently. When people contribute to Roth IRAs, they use post-tax income, meaning they don\u2019t get atax deductionin the year of the contribution. Where qualifying investments offer tax advantages by deferring payment of taxes, Roth IRAs offer a tax advantage by allowing contributors to pay a tax on their investment funds upfront in exchange for qualified distributions. Under a Roth IRA, distributions that meet certain criteria avoid any further taxation, eliminating any taxation of the appreciation of contributed funds.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that Roth IRAs have lower contribution limits thandefined contribution planssuch as 401(k)s. Roth and traditional IRAs both have annual contribution limits of $7,000 for 2024 and 2025. For individuals ages 50 and older, they can deposit a catch-up contribution of $1,000 in 2024 and 2025.\n\nFinancial instruments that qualify for deferred taxes include:\n\nQualifying investments provide an incentive for individuals to contribute to certain types of savings accounts by deferring taxes until the investor withdraws the funds.
