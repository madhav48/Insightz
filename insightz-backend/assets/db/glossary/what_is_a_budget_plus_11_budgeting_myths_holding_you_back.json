  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA budget is an estimation of revenue, expenses, or changes in finances over a specified future period and is usually compiled and re-evaluated on a periodic basis.\n\nA budget is estimation that's made for a specified future period of time. Budgeting usually occurs on an ongoing basis, with individual budgets being re-evaluated regularly. Budgets can be made for any entity that needs or wants to spend money, including governments and businesses, people, and households of any income level.\n\nA budget is a microeconomic concept that reveals the trade-off made when one good is exchanged for another. In terms of the bottom line\u2014or the end result of this trade-off\u2014asurplus budgetmeans profits are anticipated, abalanced budgetmeans revenues are expected to equal expenses, and adeficit budgetmeans expenses will exceed revenues. These principles hold true whether the budget is intended for an individual, a family, or a company.\n\nFirst, let's take a quick look at the budgeting process for a corporation, and then personal budgeting.\n\nBudgets are an integral part of running any business efficiently and effectively. Corporate budgeting begins by establishing assumptions for the upcoming budget period. These assumptions are related to projected sales trends, cost trends, and the overall economic outlook of the market,industry,orsector. Specific factors affecting potential expenses are addressed and monitored.\n\nThe budget is published in a packet that outlines the standards and procedures used to develop it, including\u00a0the assumptions about the markets, key relationships with vendors that provide discounts, and explanations of how certain calculations were made.\n\nThe sales budget is often the first to be developed, as subsequent expense budgets cannot be established without knowing futurecash flows. Budgets are developed for all the different subsidiaries, divisions, and departments within an organization. For a manufacturer, a separate budget is often developed for direct materials, labor, and overhead.\n\nAll budgets get rolled up into the master budget, which also includes budgetedfinancial statements, forecasts of cash inflows and outflows, and an overall financing plan. At a corporation, the top management reviews the budget and submits it for approval to the board of directors.\n\nThere are two major types of budgets:static budgetsand flexible budgets. A static budget remains unchanged over the life of the budget. Regardless of changes that occur during the budgeting period, all accounts and figures originally calculated remain the same. A\u00a0flexible budget has a relational value to certain variables. The dollar amounts listed on a flexible budget change based on sales levels, production levels, or other external economic factors.\n\nBoth types of budgets are useful for management. A static budget evaluates the effectiveness of the original budgeting process, while a flexible budget provides deeper insight into business operations.\n\nFor example, at the start of the year, a company may prepare a static budget based on the manufacturing of 100,00 units. As the year progresses, the company may want to evaluate the same budget as if it had been prepared for a more realistic 95,000 units. This 95,000 unit-driven budget would be a flexible budget that \"hides\" variances not necessarily based on sales.\n\nDerek Notman, CFP\u00ae, ChFC, CLUIntrepid Wealth Partners, LLC, Madison, WI\n\nThe importance of budgeting cannot be understated. A budget, also known as cash flow, is arguably more important than the actual cash that you have in your bank and investment accounts. Your cash flow is what allows you to pay for everything (or not).\n\nWithout knowing your cash flow, you could be putting yourself into a bad financial situation and not even know it. You can only get by without knowing your cash flow for so long before you get into financial trouble, so make the time to know the flow of your cash. Budgeting should be something that everyone does, regardless of their financial situation.\n\nIndividuals and families can have budgets, too. Creating and using a budget is not just for those who need to closely monitor their cash flows from month to month because money is tight.\u00a0Almost everyone can benefit from budgeting\u2014even people with large paychecks and plenty of money in the bank may find it difficult to cover the expense of an unexpected home repair.\n\nTo manage your monthly expenses, prepare for life's unpredictable events, and afford big-ticket items without going into debt, budgeting is essential. Keeping track of how much you earn doesn't require you to be a math whiz and doesn't mean you can't buy the things you want.\n\nWhat it does mean is that you can maintaincontrol over where your money goesand enjoy greater financial confidence and success.\n\nThe specifics of budgeting will depend on your personal financial situation and goals. In most cases, though, the approach is the same no matter where you stand financially. Follow these seven steps to create your budget and adjust it as needed to reach specific financial goals.\n\nOnce you've created a budget, you may have to do some juggling, especially in the first few months. This means adjusting spending here and there so that you stay within your planned budget for income and expenses. And be sure to put it in writing: If you see it and commit to it, you'll have more incentive to stick to it.\n\nBudgeting is a wonderful tool for managing yourfinances, but many people think it's not for them. It's important to become aware of budgeting myths\u2014the erroneous logic that stops people from keeping track of their money\u00a0and allocating it in ways that benefit them most. Then, you can create a budget that can help you live within your means, reach important goals, and build lasting wealth. Here are 11 budgeting myths.\n\nGetting and keeping a handle on your monthly income and expenses allows you to make sure that your hard-earned money is being put to its highest and best purpose. For those who enjoy an income that covers all bills with money left over, a budget\u00a0can helpmaximize savingsandinvestments.\n\nIf one's monthly expenses typically consume the lion's share of net income, any budget should focus on identifying and classifying all the expenses that occur during the month, quarter, and year. And for people whose cash flow is tight, the budget can be crucial to identifying expenses that could be reduced or cut, and minimizing any wastefulinterestbeing paid on credit cards or other debt.\n\nGenerally speaking, you don't need to be great at math to make and follow a budget. First of all, understanding general concepts relating to your income, spending, debt, saving, and allocating your funds are important. Then, the basic ability to add and subtract is most of what's called for. That's especially true if you're budgeting manually, with pencil and paper.\n\nAnd now, thanks to budgeting software programs, math barely enters into it. You simply have to be able to follow instructions. Many of these programs are free and legitimate. Or, if you know how to use spreadsheet software, you can make your own ledger. It's as simple as creating one column for your income, another column for your expenses, and then keeping a running tab on the difference between the two.\n\nNo one's job is truly safe. If you work for a corporation,being laid offdue to a difficult economy, downsizing, or atakeoveris always a possibility. If you work for a small company, it could die with its owner, be bought out,\u00a0or just fold.\n\nYou should always be prepared for a job loss by having at least three months' worth of living expenses in the bank. It's easier to accumulate this financial cushion if you know the amount\u00a0you're bringing in and spending each month, which can be monitored with a budget.\n\nUnemployment compensation is not a sure thing. Let's say a bad situation at work leaves you with no choice but to quit your job. Unless you can proveconstructive discharge(that is, that you were virtually forced to resign), your departure will be considered voluntary, making you ineligible for unemployment insurance. Besides, the benefits may fall well short of the wages you're used to: in even the highest paying states, the average is less than\u00a0$500 per week.\n\nBudgeting is not synonymous with spending as little money as possible or making yourself feel guilty about every purchase. The aim of budgeting is to make sure you're able to spend on what's needed and save a little each month, ideally at least 10% of your income. At the very least, budgeting can make sure that you aren't spending more than you earn.\n\nUnless you're on a very tight budget, you should be able to buy baseball tickets and go out to eat. Tracking your expenses does not change the amount of money you have available to spend every month. It just shows you where that money is going and allows you to make decisions about changing your spending habits.\n\nIf you don't have any major savings goals (e.g., upsizing your living situation, starting your own business), it's hard to drum up the motivation to stash away extra cash each month. However, your situation and your attitudes likely will change over time.\n\nLet's say that you and your partner live in New York City in a small one-bedroom apartment and things are going fine for both of you until your family dynamic changes. For instance, you may have a child or an in-law who comes to stay with you indefinitely. This may mean you'll need (and want) more room to accommodate the new addition. If you don't save up for anything big, you may not be able to afford this change in your living situation down the road.\n\nYes, the catch-22 ofstudent financial aidis that the more money you have, the less aid you'll be eligible for. That's enough to make anyone wonder if it isn't better to spend it all and have no savings in order to qualify for the maximum amount of grants and loans.\n\nThat catch mainly applies toearned income. Whether you are an adult student going back to school or the parent of a student headed to college, theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)form (used for Stafford Loans, Perkins Loans, or Pell Grants), does not require you to report the value of your primary residence (if you own a home) or the value of your retirement accounts.\n\nIf you want to save money without compromising your financial aid eligibility, you can do so by using your savings to buy a house, prepay yourmortgage, or contribute more money to your retirement accounts. The savings that you put into these assets can still be accessed if\u00a0you face an emergency, but you won't be penalized for it.\n\nEven if you employ all the available legal strategies to maximize your financial aid eligibility, you still won't always qualify for as much aid as you need. It's not a bad idea to have your own source of funds to make up for any shortfall.\n\nGood for you! However, being debt-free without any savings\u00a0won't pay your bills in an emergency. A zero balance can quickly become a negative balance if you don't have a safety net. Budgeting can help you create one.\n\nIt's never a good idea to count on unpredictable sources of income. This may be the year that your company is unable to give you a raise\u00a0(or as much of a raise as you hope for). The same is true of bonus money.Tax refundsare more reliable, but this depends in part on how good you are at calculating your own tax liability.\n\nSome people know how to figure how much they'll get in\u00a0a refund (or how much they will owe) as well as how to adjust this figure through changes in payrollwithholdingthroughout the year. However,\u00a0changes intax deductions, IRS regulations, or other life events can mean a nasty surprise when you prepare your tax return.\n\nIf you're still not convinced that budgeting is for you, here's a way to protect yourself from your own spending habits. Set up an automatic transfer from yourchecking accountto asavings accountthat you don't see regularly (i.e., at a different bank). Schedule the transfer to happen right after you get paid.\n\nIf you are saving for retirement, you may have the option of contributing a set amount regularly to a401(k)or other retirement savings plan. This way, you can pay yourself first, have enough money for the transfer, and know that you can meet your savings goal.\n\nSometimes budgeting just isn't a priority because you have too much on your plate. But there are certain government programs that can help you manage your household expenses. For instance, theSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)helps recipients of all income levels work with their food budgets to make their benefits go further.\n\nAt the very least, set up that budget so you get a feel for spending limits, any change in how you originally planned to allocate your funds, whether you're paying all you can to get rid of debt, or whether your slipping too far into debt.\n\nIn general, traditional budgeting starts with tracking expenses, eliminating debt, and, once the budget is balanced, building an emergency fund. But to speed up the process, you could start by building a partial emergency fund.\n\nThis emergency fund acts as a buffer as the rest of the budget is put in place and should replace the use ofcredit cardsfor emergency situations.\n\nThe key is to build the fund at regular intervals, consistently devoting a certain percentage of each paycheck toward it, and if possible, putting in whatever you can spare on top. This will get you to think about your spending, too.\n\nYou should only use your emergency fund for true emergencies. For instance, if you lose your job and need to pay for expenses, you could tap into your rainy day fund until you join the workforce again. You can also use this money if you have an unexpected medical emergency that arises.\n\nYou would save money if you used your emergency fund to eliminatecredit card debt, but the purpose of the fund is to prevent you from having to use your credit card for paying for unexpected expenses. With a proper emergency fund, you will not need your credit card to keep you afloat when something goes wrong.\n\nOnce you have a buffer between you and high-interest debt, you can start the process of downsizing. The more space you can create between your expenses and your income, the more income you will have to pay down debt and invest.\n\nThis can be a process of substitution as much as elimination. For example, cancel any recurring subscriptions that you don't regularly use or need. Use half of the money you save to invest for a goal or to pay off outstanding debts. Save the other half to bulk up your emergency fund.\n\nAlthougheliminating expensesentirely is the fastest way to a solid budget, substitution tends to have more lasting effects. So consider:\n\nPeople can sometimes cut too many expenses so that they end up with a budget that they can't stick to. Substitution, in contrast, keeps the basics while trimming costs.\n\nOnce you have your budget in place and have more money coming in than going out, you can start investing to create more income.\n\nIt is better to have no debt before you begin investing. If you are young, however, the rewards of investing inhigher-risk, high-returnsecurities like stocks can outweigh most low-interest debt over time.\n\nKeep your receipts so that you know exactly how much you spend each month. This can help you determine how much to budget for any expenses that may change from month to month.\n\nYou've got your budget set up. Now you've got to stick to it. But that credit card still calls your name, your clothes budget seems awfully small, and you feel deprived. At such moments, it helps to revisit the whole reason for a budget\u2014to help you manage your finances, achieve financial goals, and lead a life free from fear of financial pitfalls.\n\nYour budget can keep you out of overwhelming debt and help you build a financial future that will give you more freedom, not less. So think about the future you want and remember that keeping to your budget will help you get there. Adding to yourdebt load, on the other hand, will mean that your financial future could be less bright.\n\nEvery time you enter your spending in your software or budget notebook, review everything that's been spent to date and compare it to income received. This will keep you abreast of where things stand and encourage you to keep at it, especially if you are reining in your spending as intended. This daily or weekly activity can give you an enormous sense of accomplishment and keep you on track.\n\nMake it more difficult to make impulse purchases. In other words, set up barriers that give you time to think: \"Is this purchase necessary?\" Opt out of retailer email lists.\u00a0Remove your stored payment information on your favorite online shops so you can't just click to order. Adjust your phone settings to block tracking and advertising as much as possible.\n\nIf you feel like you're the only one in your group who is on a budget, search for some like-minded folks. You could find an online forum, a monthly meeting, or even a couple of friends who will listen to your concerns and share their budgeting experiences. Set up accountability calls with your frugal buddies to talk things over and keep temptation at bay.\n\nJust know that you're not the only person setting sensible financial limits for yourself.\n\nThere's something powerful about handing over a stack of $20\u00a0bills for a purchase.\u00a0You have to confront the money you're about to spend and accept that the spending is worth it. Swiping adebit card, on the other hand, may not feel nearly as real.\n\nSimilarly, paying bills by writing checks and promptly entering the sums in your register keeps you up-to-date on how your account is\u00a0affected\u00a0in a way that autopay doesn't.\n\nYou don't have to use cash exclusively or completely forgo online payments. But handling transactions in hands-on ways can make you realize how much you're spending and enhance the power of self-regulation.\n\nIf you constantly look at what you have to give up, the very act of budgeting becomes distasteful. A mixture of long-\u00a0and short-term gifts to yourself will help keep you motivated.\n\nWhen you've been faithful to your budget for a month, give yourself a reward. Even small ones such as\u00a0a night out with friends, a concert, or\u00a0a little extra cash for spending can help.\n\nKeep visual reminders of these rewards\u00a0or the things you're saving up for. Start building associations in your brain that make sticking to your budget an enjoyable activity with happy results.\n\nIt's difficult to predict correctly how much money you'll need in every category of your budget. For instance, a new job may necessitate a wardrobe change and your existing clothing budget may not cut it. That's why it's important to conduct a regular check on how well your budget is working. It may need tweaking. This is to be expected. Just make sure that you always keep your long-term financial goals in the picture.\n\nLearn all you can about finances,money management,\u00a0and how you can best invest in yourself. Talk to your financially savvy friends and\u00a0seek out real-world tips and advice from people who are doing well with their money.\n\nThe more you learn about handling money wisely and the rewards that can result from such an effort, the more concrete and acceptable the reasons for budgeting will be.\n\nBudgeting is smart, but if you're suffering from mounting bills and a lack of funds, it may not be where your focus is. In such circumstances, consider some additional steps that you can take to gain control of your finances.\n\nDon't be afraid to request bill extensions or payment plans from creditors. Skipping or delaying payments only worsens your debt. And late fees ding your credit score.\n\nGo over all your bills to see what can and should be paid first, prioritize those that are late, and then set up a payment schedule based on your paydays.\n\nCall the bill companies to see how much you can pay now to get back on track toward a positive status. Explain that you are taking strict measures to catch up. Be forthright about the amount you can afford to pay now. Don't just promise to pay the full amount later.\n\nStashing 10% of your income into yoursavings accountis daunting or impossible when you're living paycheck to paycheck. It doesn't make sense to have $100 in a savings plan if you are fending offdebt collectors. Your savings can wait until you can reclaim financial stability.\n\nTo fix your finances, you need to get a handle on your outlay first. Online banking and online budgeting software can help you categorize spending so you can make adjustments. Many people find that just by looking at aggregate figures fordiscretionary expenses, they are spurred to reduce excessive spending.\n\nHopefully, your budget has given you a sense of where your money goes. Now it's time to tighten up. Start cutting back on items that you wouldn't miss. Change habits that are costing you, like letting food spoil before you can eat it. Prepare meals at home instead of going to restaurants or getting takeout.\n\nYou may be able to reduce some expenses that you shouldn't drop. For example, you might be able to lower your auto insurance premium by switching carriers.\n\nThose ultra-high interest rates on your credit cards aren't fixed in stone. Call the card company\u00a0and ask for a reduction in theannual\u00a0percentage rates (APR). If you have a good payment record, your request might be approved. This won't lower your outstanding balance, but it will keep it from mushrooming as fast.\n\nOnce you've gone through these steps, monitor your progress for a few months. You can do this by writing everything you spend in a notebook, with budgeting apps on your phone, or with the software you may already use for your budget.\n\nEnsure that every cent is accounted for. Fine-tune and adjust your spending as needed after each month. This not only can help get you out of financial trouble. It also can put the spotlight back on the importance of your budget.\n\nFor the time being, saving and investing is out. But consider ways to increase your earnings: working overtime, getting a second job, or picking up some freelance work.\n\nCreating a budget takes some work. You'll need to calculate every type of income you receive each month. Next,track your spendingand tabulate all your monthly expenses, including your rent or mortgage, utility payments, debt, transportation costs, food, miscellaneous spending, and more. You may have to make some adjustments initially to stay within your budget. But once you've gone through the first few months, it should become easier to stick to it.\n\nThe 50-20-30 budget rule was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in her bookAll Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan.The plan entails dividing all of your after-tax income into 50% for your actual needs, 30% for anything you want, and 20% for savings.\n\nJust like budgets help people, corporate budgeting helpsbusinesses stay on topof their finances. It also helps business leaders make very important investment decisions, manage and meet goals and objectives, and identify any financial hurdles that come their way.\n\nA budget often conjures up images of complicated financial documents. But in reality, it's a money management tool that can be used by various entities, including governments, businesses, and individuals/households of every income level. Budgets can help prepare you to make better decisions about your money so that you can secure a brighter financial future.\n\nForbes Advisor. \"The States With The Best And Worst Unemployment Benefits\u2014And Why They\u2019re So Different.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid, U.S. Department of Education.\"6 Things Students Need Before They Fill Out the 2024-25 FAFSA Form.\"\n\nUSA.gov. \"Government Benefits.\"\n\nFiftyThirtyTwenty.com. \"Income + Financial Stability in America.\"",
