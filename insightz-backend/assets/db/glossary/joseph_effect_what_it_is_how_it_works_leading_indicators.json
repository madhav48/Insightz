  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nDaniel Rathburn is an editor at Investopedia who works on tax, accounting, regulatory, and cryptocurrency content.\n\nThe Joseph Effect\u00a0is a term derived from the Old Testament story about the Pharaoh\u2019s dream as recounted by Joseph. The vision\u00a0led the ancient Egyptians to expect a crop famine lasting seven years to follow\u00a0seven years of a bountiful harvest.\n\nThe Joseph Effect is a term coined by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot and postulates that movements over time tend to be part of larger trends andcyclesmore often than being random. Mandelbrot drew his theories from the Old Testament story of Joseph recounting the Pharaoh\u2019s dream of seven fat cows being devoured by seven lean cows. The interpretation was that following seven good years of crop harvesting, seven bad years would follow.\n\nSeven good years are known as the Joseph Effect, while the seven bad years are known as The Noah Effect. Interestingly, the seven-year cycle is commonly found in modern economic analysis as a predictor ofrecessiontiming.\n\nThe Joseph Effect and the Noah Effect are early examples taken from history showing that man was attuned to cycles in nature and wanted to become better able to predict future outcomes from recent experience. Human behavior is affected in great part by recent experience, with a tendency to forget some of the more random, and disruptive, lessons of the distant past.\n\nMathematicians set out to quantify these observed cycles into predictable formulas, and Mandelbrot quantified The Joseph Effect using the Hurst component. The Hurst component quantifiesregression toward the meanover time for any number of price movements.\n\nAt the heart of each term is the notion that trends tend to persist over time. If an area of the world has been in a drought, the odds are high it will remain in drought for some time to come. A baseball team that has been winning recent games is likely to continue winning. If a stock price has been rising steadily, the likelihood of this continuing is strong.\u00a0Technical analysts use trend lines to show this persistence principle.\n\nThe Joseph Effect and the Noah Effect are just two of many mathematical trend analyses used by savvy investors. For example, chart analysis is an important tool in predicting future stock price movements. Investors look at volume trends, price ranges, momentum indicators, leading indicators, and lagging indicators.\n\nLeading indicators and lagging indicators are especially important to classify and understand. Commonly used leading indicators include theConsumer Confidence Index, thePurchasing Managers Index, and movements in bond yields, especially when aninverted yieldoccurs. Corporate hiring plans are also a significant leading indicator.",
