  "term": "Incremental Capital Output Ratio (ICOR): Definition and Formula",
  "definition": "The incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) is a frequently used tool that explains the relationship between the level of investment made in the economy and the subsequent increase in thegross domestic product(GDP). ICOR indicates the additional unit of capital or investment needed to produce an additional unit of output.\n\nICOR is a metric that assesses the marginal amount of investment capital necessary for a country or other entity to generate the next unit of production.\n\nOverall, a higher ICOR value is not preferred because it indicates that the entity's production is inefficient. The measure is used predominantly in determining a country's level ofproduction efficiency.\n\nSome critics of ICOR have suggested that its uses are restricted because there is a limit to how efficient countries can become based on available technology. For example, a developing country can theoretically increase its GDP by a greater margin with a set amount of resources than its developed counterpart can.\n\nThis is because the developed country is already operating with the highest level of technology and infrastructure whereas a developing country has room to improve. Any further improvements in a developed country would have to come from more costlyresearch and development(R&D), whereas the developing country can implement existing technology to better its situation.\n\n\ufeffICOR=Annual\u00a0InvestmentAnnual\u00a0Increase\u00a0in\u00a0GDPICOR=\\frac{\\text{Annual Investment}}{\\text{Annual Increase in GDP}}ICOR=Annual\u00a0Increase\u00a0in\u00a0GDPAnnual\u00a0Investment\u200b\ufeff\n\nFor example, suppose that Country X has an incremental capital output ratio (ICOR) of 10. This implies that $10 worth ofcapital investmentis necessary to generate $1 of extra production. Furthermore, if country X's ICOR was 12 last year, this implies that Country X has become more efficient in its use of capital.\n\nFor advanced economies, accurately estimating ICOR is subject to many issues. A primary complaint of critics is its inability to adjust to the new economy\u2014an economy ever-more-driven byintangible assets\u2014such as design, branding, research and development (R&D), and software\u2014which are difficult to measure or record.\n\nIntangible assets are more challenging to factor into investment levels and GDP thantangible assets, like machinery, buildings, and computers.\n\nOn-demand options, such assoftware-as-a-service(SaaS), have greatly driven down the need for investments infixed assets. This can be extended even further with the rise of \"as-a-service\" models for nearly everything. It all adds up to businesses increasing their production levels with items that are now expensed, and not capitalized, and thus, considered an investment.\n\nBetween 1947 and 2017, the\u00a0Indian economy\u00a0was premised on the concept of\u00a0planning and carried out through the Five-Year Plans. The 12th Five-Year Plan of the Government of India was India's final Five-Year Plan.\n\nThe Planning Commission of India determined the required rate of investment that would be needed to achieve different growth outcomes in the 12th Five-Year Plan. For a growth rate of 8%, the investment rate at market price would need to be at 30.5%, while for a growth rate of 9.5%, an investment rate of 35.8% would be required.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nInvestment rates in India dropped from the level of 36.8% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the year 2007 to 2008 to 30.8% from 2012 to 2013. The rate of growth during the same period fell from 9.6% to 6.2%.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nClearly, the drop in India\u2019s growth during this period was more dramatic and steeper than the fall in the investment rates. Therefore, there must have been reasons beyond savings and investment rates that would explain the drop in the rate of growth in the Indian economy. Otherwise, the economy is getting increasingly inefficient: In 2019, India's GDP growth rate was 4.23% and its rate of investments as a percentage of GDP was 30.21%.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nGovernment of India Planning Commission. \"Faster, Sustainable and More Inclusive Growth: An Approach to the Twelfth Five Year Plan,\" Page 9-27.
