  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA nontariff barrier is a trade restriction that doesn't involvetariffs. Instead of applying taxes on imports, countries use various methods\u2014such as quotas, embargoes,sanctions, andlevies\u2014to limit or regulate trade.\u00a0These barriers are often used for political, economic, or strategic reasons and can be used alongside or in place of traditional tariffs.\n\nCountries commonly use nontariff barriers ininternational trade. Decisions about when to impose nontariff barriers are influenced by a country's political alliances and the overall availability of goods and services.\n\nAny barrier to international trade, including tariffs and nontariff barriers, generally influences the global economy\u00a0because\u00a0it limits the functions of the free market. The lost revenue that some companies may experience from these barriers can be considered\u00a0aneconomic loss, especially for proponents of laissez-faire capitalism. They believe that governments should abstain from interfering in the workings of the free market.\n\nCountries use nontariff barriers in place of or in conjunction with conventional tariff barriers. These are taxes that an exporting country pays to an\u00a0importing country\u00a0for goods or services. Tariffs are the most commontrade barrier, increasing the cost of products and services in\u00a0an importing country.\n\nCountries often pursue alternatives to standard tariffs because they release countries from paying added taxes on imported goods. Alternatives to standard tariffs can have a meaningful impact on the level of trade while creating a different monetary impact than standard tariffs.\n\nNontariff barriers exist in several forms. Here are the most common types:\n\nCountries may use licenses to limitimported goodsto specific businesses. A business can import goods that would otherwise be\u00a0restricted for trade in the country when granted a trade license.\n\nCountries often issuequotasfor\u00a0importing and exporting\u00a0goods and services. They agree on specified limits for\u00a0products and services allowed for importation to a country. In most cases, importing these goods and services is not restricted until a country reaches its quota, which it can set for a specific time. Quotas are also often used in international trade licensing\u00a0agreements.\n\nEmbargoesare the result of a country or several countries officially banning the trade of specified goods and services with another. Governments may take this measure\u00a0to support their specific political or economic\u00a0goals.\n\nCountries imposesanctionson other countries to limit their trade activity. Sanctions can include increased administrative actions or additional customs and trade procedures that slow or limit a country\u2019s ability to trade.\n\nExporting countries sometimes use voluntary export restraints to limit the number of goods and services they can export to specified countries. These restraints are typically based on availability and political alliances.\n\nNontariff barriers may encourage a local economy to self-manufacture in a way similar to that of a manufacturing country. The target outcome is largely the same, though the mechanism changes.\n\nThe primary advantage of nontariff barriers is the protection of domestic industries from foreign competition. Governments can shield their industries from low-cost imports, supporting local businesses and preserving jobs, by imposing regulations and standards,\n\nNontariff barriers related to product standards and regulations help ensure that imported goods meet specific quality and safety standards. This can be advantageous for consumers by reducing the risk of substandard or unsafe products entering the market.\n\nNontariff barriers are also implemented to safeguard national security interests. These measures can include export controls on sensitive technologies or restrictions on imports of certain strategic goods to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands. They're used to counteract the practice of dumping where foreign producers sell goods in a foreign market at prices below their cost of production to seize the competitive market.\n\nOne of the most significant disadvantages of nontariff barriers is their potential to distort international trade.\n\nNontariff barriers can disrupt the natural flow of goods by creating obstacles to imports, leading to trade imbalances, inefficiencies, and market distortions. This is obviously intentional because nontariff barriers often limit the variety of goods available to consumers but it impacts consumers who then have fewer options. They may be denied access to potentially superior or more affordable products.\n\nCompliance with nontariff barriers can be costly for both producers and consumers. Manufacturers may have to adjust their production processes to meet specific standards. Importers can incur additional expenses related to documentation, inspections, and compliance checks. Nontariff barriers are often more complex than tariffs with sometimes uncertain implications.\n\nNontariff barriers can sometimes discriminate against foreign goods in favor of domestic products. This violates the principles of non-discrimination and fair trade enshrined in international trade agreements. Overly restrictive nontariff barriers can also hinder economic growth by limiting access to global markets andstifling competition. This can slow down innovation and productivity globally.\n\nNontariff barriers can promote activities that don't encourage the best resource allocation. Resources may be misallocated when nontariff barriers protect inefficient domestic industries. Capital and labor may be directed toward industries that might not be globally competitive without trade restrictions, putting an overall efficiency strain on the global economy.\n\nMay protect domestic industries\n\nEnsures product quality and safety\n\nMay prevent product dumping from other countries\n\nMay distort international trade leading to trade imbalances\n\nMay be more complex and difficult to understand\n\nMay not yield the most efficient economic policy\n\nTariffs and nontariff barriers are two distinct mechanisms that countries employ to regulate international trade. Tariffs are monetary barriers in the form oftaxesimposed on imported or exported goods. Nontariff barriers encompass a diverse range of non-monetary measures.\n\nTariffs target specific products or industries but nontariff barriers can have a broader and often less transparent impact on trade. Tariffs are typically a subject of negotiation in trade deals and offer some flexibility in adjusting rates. Nontariff barriers can be more challenging to quantify and may require complex compliance measures, making them a critical focus in international trade negotiations.\n\nTariffs directly affect the prices of imported goods in many cases. and can be used strategically to influence trade volumes and generate government revenue. Nontariff barriers, although they can indirectly impact prices, are often employed to achieve various policy objectives beyond revenue generation. They may be put in place to safeguard domestic industries or to ensure product quality and safety. Incidental pricing impacts can occur as part of this barrier.\n\nTrade agreements often involve negotiations regarding both tariffs and nontariff barriers, as their distinct characteristics require nuanced approaches for trade facilitation. In some contexts, both are used in tandem, as it may be easier to manipulate one (i.e. tariffs) based on agreed-upon nontariff barriers.\n\nThe United Nations adopted a round of nontariff barriers against North Korea and the Kim Jong\u00a0Un regime in December 2017. The nontariff barriers included sanctions that cut\u00a0exports of gasoline, diesel, and other refined oil products to the nation.\n\nNontariff barriers can be significant roadblocks for businesses looking to expand their markets in international trade. The United States is actively committed to addressing this issue on multiple fronts. \u00a0The United States is actively committed to addressing this issue on multiple fronts. The U.S. is pushing to reduce or eliminate nontariff barriers in various regional contexts, including the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation, and to contribute to analysis at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.\n\nThe United Nations has also prohibited\u00a0the export of industrial equipment, machinery, transport\u00a0vehicles, and industrial metals to North Korea. The intention of these nontariff barriers was to put economic pressure on the nation to stop its nuclear arms and military exercises.\n\nNontariff barriers can be legal or illegal, depending on their nature and adherence to international trade agreements. Many nontariff barriers are considered legal, especially when they are employed for legitimate reasons such as ensuring product safety, protecting national security, or preserving public health. These measures are generally permitted as long as they align with the rules set by international bodies like theWorld Trade Organization (WTO).\n\nCompanies can employ several strategies to overcome nontariff barriers in international trade. They can adapt their products and operations to meet the required standards and regulations. Collaboration with local partners or trade associations can provide valuable insights and support in navigating nontariff pay. Companies can also engage in dialogue with government authorities to advocate for trade facilitation measures and compliance support.\n\nNontariff barriers are enforced through regulatory and administrative measures by the importing country's government authorities.\n\nThese enforcement processes typically involve rigorous documentation andcustomsprocedures, including inspections, testing, and compliance checks to ensure adherence to specific requirements. Licensing and permits may be required for certain goods and import quotas are monitored to ensure that limits are not exceeded.\n\nNontariff barriers are significant obstacles in international trade, impacting businesses by imposing additional costs, compliance requirements, and restrictions. While nontariff barriers can be effective for achieving political and economic goals, they can also distort the natural flow of goods, create inefficiencies, and limit consumer choice. Companies looking to expand in international markets must carefully navigate these barriers and adapt to local regulations to ensure continued trade success.\n\nCFI Education. \"Non-Tariff Barriers.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Non-Tariff Barriers.\"\n\nUnited Nations Security Council. \"Resolution 2397 (2017).\"",
