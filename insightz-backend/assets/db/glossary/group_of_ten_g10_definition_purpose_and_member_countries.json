  "term": "Group of Ten (G10): Definition, Purpose, and Member Countries",
  "definition": "The Group of Ten (G10) consists of 11 industrialized nations that meet on an annual basis\u00a0or more to consult, debate, and cooperate on international finance. The member countries are Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The G10 is one of five similar groups, not to be confused with the Group of 7, 8, 20, or 24.\u00a0Each of these consists of a group with similar economic interests.\n\nAs noted above, the G10 is a group of 11 industrialized countries that meet each year to discuss financial matters important to the global community. Finance ministers and central bank governors from each of the 11 countries gather in connection with annual meetings of theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)and theWorld Bankto discuss financial and monetary policies that impact member countries, trade, and the global economy.\n\nTheBank for International Settlements\u00a0(BIS)is an international finance organization owned and operated by over 60 member central banks that together comprise over 95% of the world's GDP. Its mission is to serve central banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial stability, to foster cooperation among the banks, and to serve as the central bank for them.\n\nThe main goal of the G10 is to coordinatefiscal and monetary policiesamong its 11 members and with other international financial institutions, mainly the IMF. These economic policies relate to exchange rates, monetary frameworks, and financial regulations.\n\nBy promoting cooperation among leading economies, taking measures to address emerging risks, mitigating financial crises, and monitoring economic trends, the G10 ultimately pursues global financial stability and a stronger worldwide financial environment.\n\nThe G10 was established when the 10 wealthiest IMF member\u00a0countries agreed to participate in theGeneral Agreements to Borrow (GAB), a now-terminated lending medium for the participating countries.\n\nThe GAB was formed in 1962, when the governments of eight IMF members\u2014Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States\u2014and the central banks of Germany and Sweden, agreed to make resources available to the IMF. These resources were for drawings by both IMF participants and, under some circumstances, non-participants.\n\nSwitzerland signed the GAB in 1964, despite not being a member of the IMF at the time,\u00a0thereby strengthening the agreement.\n\nIt was at a G10\u00a0Forum in 1971 where members worked to createThe Smithsonian Agreementfollowing the collapse of theBretton WoodsSystem. This new system replaced the fixed exchange rate system with a floating exchange rate one.\n\nThe following international organizations function as official observers of the meetings and activities of the G10:\n\nThese observer organizations do not vote or set G10 policies but closely monitor discussions to stay aligned, provide input when invited, and coordinate global financial governance alongside the G10.\n\nThe G10\u2019s meetings and activities have led to positive outcomes with an impact on the global financial landscape:\n\nThe G10 is just one of the international groups that meet regularly to discuss global issues. The most common are the Group of Seven (G7) and the Group of Twenty (G20).\n\nThe Group of Seven (G7) is made up of the world's largest and mostdeveloped economies. They include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. The group, which was established in the 1970s, was originally called the Group of Eight (G8) until Russia was removed following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRather than central bank governors, government leaders of the G7 meet regularly in one of the seven countries to discuss issues relating to the economy and finance. These countries may also discuss issues of other importance, including geopolitical issues and helpingdeveloping nations.\n\nThe group isn't a formal body. As such, the policies and resolutions it may come up with are recommended and cannot be enforced.\n\nThe Group of Twenty (G20) is composed of 19 member countries plus the European Union; included countries are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Spain is a permanent guest of the group.\n\nThe G20 meets annually. While the meetings focus primarily on macroeconomic issues, other issues are also discussed. These include health, agriculture, climate change, and anti-corruption, among others.\n\nSwitzerland joined the G10 in 1964 expanding the group's membership to 11.\n\nThe Group of Seven or G7 comprises seven of the world's advanced economies, including Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, as well as the European Union.\n\nThe G20 Leaders' Summit 2025 will take place in November in Johannesburg, South Africa.Leaders from all 19 member countries, along with the African Union and the European Union, are expected to attend.\n\nThe Group of Ten is a coalition of 11 countries that work together to shape international finance by coordinating fiscal and monetary policies to promote financial stability. The G10 meets annually at a minimum and tackles topics such as emerging risks, trade agreements, and financial crises.\n\nInternational Money Fund. \"A Guide to Committees, Groups, and Clubs.\"\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"About BIS - Overview.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"A Guide to Committees, Groups, and Clubs.\"\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"Group of Ten - Financial Stability in Emerging Market Economies.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"The Smithsonian Agreement.\"\n\nMasterClass. \"G10 Definition: The G10 Countries and Monetary Agreements.\"\n\nCouncil On Foreign Relations. \"Where Is The G7 Headed?\"\n\nGovernment of Canada; 2025 G7 Presidency. \"About the G7.\"\n\nEuropean Commission. \"Agriculture and Rural Development: G20.\"\n\nG20 South Africa 2025. \"Engagement Groups.\"\n\nG20 South Africa 2025. \"Overview.\"",
