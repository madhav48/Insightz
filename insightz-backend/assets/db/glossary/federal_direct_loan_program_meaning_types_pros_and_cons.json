The William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program, managed by the United States Department of Education, is the only government-backed student loan program in the U.S.\n\nThe Federal Direct Loan Program offersseveral types of loans,\u00a0including subsidized direct loans, unsubsidized direct loans, direct PLUS loans, and direct consolidation loans.\n\nSubsidized direct loans are the only federal student loans based on financial need. The U.S. Department of Education pays the interest on these loans while the student is in school.\n\nAll loans granted through the Federal Direct Loan Program have maximum annual amounts and set aggregate amounts. Each successive year allows for an increase in the total maximum yearly loan amount. Students who wish to apply for funding must first submit theFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).\n\nUndergraduate students can borrow $5,500 to $12,500 per year, depending on their school year and\u00a0dependency status. These amounts are for both direct subsidized loans and direct unsubsidized loans.\n\nProfessional and graduate students may borrow $20,500 yearly in direct unsubsidized loans, and parents of undergraduate students can borrow using a direct PLUS loan.\n\nYour college or university determines the amount of money in federal loans that you can borrow.\n\nDirect subsidized loans are for undergraduate students eligible for financial assistance due to their or their families' economic circumstances.\n\nThese loans help to cover the costs of a professional career, school, college, or university. Qualified individuals can borrow up to $12,500 annually in direct subsidized loans and $57,500 in total during their undergraduate years.\n\nThese federal loans\u00a0are available to eligible undergraduate, graduate, and professional students. They are not based on financial need. Undergraduate borrowers can borrow up to $12,500 per year and up to $57,500 in total. Graduate and professional students can borrow up to $20,500 per year and up to $138,500 in total.\n\nThese loans are offered to parents of undergraduate and graduate or professional students to help offset the costs of education not covered by other financial aid. Eligibility is not based on financial need.\n\nBorrowers with less than stellar credit may access these loans, but they must meet additional criteria.\n\nNo minimum credit score is required for parents to take out a PLUS loan, but they cannot have adverse credit.\n\nThese loans allow a student or family tocombine all eligible federal student loansinto one loan with a single service provider and loan payment. Direct consolidation loans also provide access to additional loan repayment programs.\n\nThe federal direct student loan program has its advantages anddisadvantages.\n\nFederal repayment programs can help when it's time to pay loans back\n\nGrace period on repayment after graduation\n\nOnly unsubsidized direct loans are offered to graduate students\n\nParents who take out PLUS loans must pay fees\n\nCan borrow only a specific amount each year\n\nSubsidized direct student loans have eligibility criteria\n\nPrivate lenders also provide student loans that can be used instead of\u2014or in addition to\u2014federal loans.

Unsubsidized student loans for graduate students have an interest rate of 8.08%. Direct PLUS loans for parents and graduate students have an interest rate of 9.08%, the highest interest rate of all federal student loans.\n\nDepending on thetype of repayment planyou have, your student loan may be forgiven after a certain amount of time.\n\nYou must submit a new Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) every year that you need funding for higher education (undergraduate and graduate).\n\nThe Federal Direct Loan Program offers a number of advantages, including low, fixed interest rates, but there are downsides to account for as well. For example, you can only borrow a certain amount each year. Consider all of your financing options before deciding which type of student loan is best for you.\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loans.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"How Much Money Can I Borrow in Federal Student Loans?\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Direct PLUS Loans Are Federal Loans That Graduate or Professional Students and Parents of Dependent Undergraduate Students Can Use to Help Pay for College or Career School.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Consolidating Student Loans.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Apply for Financial Aid.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Federal Student Loan Repayment Plans.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Student Loan Forgiveness.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Discharge in Bankruptcy.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Federal Versus Private Loans.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"Federal Interest Rates and Fees.\"",
