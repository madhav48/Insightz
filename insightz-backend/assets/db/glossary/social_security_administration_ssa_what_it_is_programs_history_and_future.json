  "term": "Social Security Administration (SSA): What It Is, Programs, History, and Future",
  "definition": "The Social Security Administration (SSA) is a U.S. government agency that administers social programs covering disability, retirement, and survivors\u2019 benefits, among other services. It\u2019s also responsible for issuing Social Security numbers and managing the program\u2019s finances andtrust fund.\n\nUnlike most U.S. government agencies, the SSA is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, rather than Washington, D.C.The SSA has 10 regional offices, six processing centers, and approximately 1,230 field offices. It employs almost 60,000 workers.However, the SSA hasannounced workforce reductions and office closuresin 2025 under President Donald Trump.\n\nThe SSA administers theSocial Securityprogram. Social Security is vital to Americans\u2019retirement income planning, particularly as savings rates for retirement remain low: 4.6% as of February 2025.Almost 69 million Americans, including retired workers, disabled workers, and survivors, will receive monthly Social Securitybenefitsin 2025, according to the SSA. Social Security is one of the largest government programs in the world.\n\nThe benefits arefunded with payroll taxespaid by employers, employees, and the self-employed. The tax revenue goes into two Social Security trust funds: theOld-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fundfor retirees and theDisability Insurance Trust Fund (DI)for disability beneficiaries.\n\nThe SSA provides a wide range of services in addition to overseeing retirement and disability benefits programs and administeringSupplemental Security Income (SSI), including enrollment in Parts A and B of theMedicareprogram.It also issues theSocial Security numbers (SSNs)required to access numerous government and private-sector services, from credit financing and insurance coverage to hunting licenses.\n\nSSI is distinct from Social Security and is not funded by payroll taxes. It aids the disabled, blind, and elderly with limitedincomeand resources.\n\nThe Social Security Board was created in 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed theSocial Security Actinto law. The board was responsible for old age insurance, unemployment compensation, and public assistance.\u00a0The Social Security Board was abolished in 1946 and placed its functions under the newly established Social Security Administration.\u00a0The SSA was part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) until 1994, when it regained its original status as an independent agency.\n\nIn 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the bill that created Medicare, which the SSA is responsible for administering. Amendments in 1972 created the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program and annualcost-of-living adjustments (COLAs)to Social Security benefits and SSI.\n\nAs of 2025, the SSA is an independent agency led byLee Dudek, who was appointedby President Trump as acting commissioner in February 2025.President Trumpnominated Frank Bisignanofor commissioner, and his nomination awaits a vote by the full U.S. Senate as of April 4, 2025.The trustees of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds report on the current and projected financial status of the programs annually.\n\nThe Boards of Trustees of Social Security and Medicare issue a report each year on the current and projected financial status of their programs. The boards projected in their 2024 report that Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fund\u00a0reserves will be depleted in 2033, unchanged from the 2023 report. Payroll tax receipts will be sufficient to pay just 79% of scheduled benefits in 2033, an improvement from the 77% projection in the 2023 report.\n\nAccording to the 2024 report, the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund is projected to be able to pay 100% of total scheduled benefits through 2098. The 2023 report projected that the DI Trust Fund would be able to pay scheduled benefits through 2097.\n\nThe combined OASI Trust Fund and the DI Trust Fund, termed OASDI, are projected to pay 100% of benefits until 2035, when the reserves will be depleted based on the boards\u2019 2024 findings. At that point, continuing fund income would cover 83% of benefits. The boards\u2019 2023 report said OASDI reserves would be depleted in 2034 and continuing fund income would then cover 80% of benefits.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) oversees the Social Security program, which provides benefits for qualified retirees, disabled people, and their spouses, children, and survivors. The SSA also administers Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefit payments, handles Medicare Parts A and B, and issues Social Security numbers.\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) provides monthly cash payments to help elderly or disabled people with little to no income meet basic needs. This program is separate from the retirement and disability benefits under Social Security.\n\nAmericans can request a new card online\u00a0atSSA\u2019s websiteto replace their Social Security card if it requires no other changes.They can also fill out a print version of the\u00a0application and return it by mail.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) manages, administers, and disperses benefits to millions of Americans annually. Understanding the SSA and how it works can help ensure individuals and their families receive the benefits they are entitled to.\n\nUSAGov. \u201cSocial Security Administration (SSA).\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cSocial Security Administration (SSA) Annual Data for Field Office Visitors (Daily Average).\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cPersonal Saving Rate.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cFact Sheet: Social Security.\u201d Page 1.\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cHow Is Social Security Financed?\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cPlan for Medicare.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cTypes of Social Security Cards.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cSupplemental Security Income (SSI).\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cHistorical Background and Development of Social Security.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cStatement From Lee Dudek, Acting Commissioner, About Commitment to Agency Transparency and Protecting Benefits and Information.\u201d\n\nMarketWatch. \u201cSocial Security Commissioner Nominee Advances Despite Whistleblower Allegations.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cStatus of the Social Security and Medicare Programs: A Summary of the 2024 Annual Reports.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cStatus of the Social Security and Medicare Programs: A Summary of the 2023 Annual Reports.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cReplace Social Security Card.\u201d\n\nU.S. Social Security Administration. \u201cApplication for a Social Security Card.\u201d",
