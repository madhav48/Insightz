  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nBrand equity is the value premium that a company generates from a product with a recognizable name,\u00a0when compared to a generic equivalent.\n\nBrand equity is the value a company gains from its name recognition and its perceived benefits and admirable qualities.\n\nCompanies can build their brand equity by making their products memorable, easily recognizable, and superior in quality and reliability. Mass marketing campaigns also help to create and strengthen brand equity.\n\nWhen a company has positive brand equity, customers willingly pay a high price for its products, even though they could get the same thing from a competitor for less. Customers, in effect, pay a price premium to do business with a firm they know and admire.\n\nBrand equity has a few basic components:\n\nForemost is consumer perception, which includes both knowledge of and experience with a brand and its products. Consumer perception relates directly to brand equity. The perception that a consumer segment has of abrandresults in either positive or negative effects for the company.\n\nIf the perception is positive, the organization, its products, and its financials can benefit. If the perception is negative, the opposite is true.\n\nThese effects can turn into either tangible or intangible value. If the effect is positive, tangible value is realized as increases inrevenueor profits. Intangible value is realized in marketing as awareness orgoodwill.\n\nIf the effects are negative, the tangible or intangible value is also negative. For example, if consumers prefer a generic product over a branded one, the brand is said to have negative brand equity. Such willingness to ignore the branded product might exist if a company has a majorproduct recallor causes a widely publicized environmental disaster.\n\nBrand equity is an extension ofbrand recognition. But more so than recognition, brand equity is the added value associated with a particular company.\n\nThe importance of brand equity's potential to boost profits and increaseprofit marginsis demonstrated by the effort that certain companies make to support the high quality of their products.\n\nWhen customers attach a level of quality or prestige to a brand, they perceive that brand's products as being worth more than products made by competitors. Thus, they are willing to pay more for them. In effect, the market bears higher prices for brands that have high levels of brand equity.\n\nYet, the cost of manufacturing a polo shirt and bringing it to market is not higher, at least to a significant degree, for an established company such as Lacoste than it is for a less reputable brand.\n\nHowever, because its customers are willing to pay more, it can charge a higher price for that shirt, with the difference going to profit. Therefore, positive brand equity canincrease profit marginper customer.\n\nBrand equity has adirect effect on salesvolume because consumers gravitate toward products that either have great reputations themselves or come from companies with great reputations (or both). For example, when Apple releases a new product, customers line up around the block to buy it even though it is usually priced higher than similar products from competitors.\n\nOne of the primary reasonswhy Apple's products sellin such large numbers is that the company has amassed a staggering amount of positive brand equity. Because a certain percentage of a company's costs to sell products is\u00a0fixed, higher sales volumes translate to greater profit margins.\n\nCustomer retention is the third area in which brand equity affects profit margins. Returning to the Apple example, most of the company's customers own not just one Apple product, but several. Plus, they eagerly anticipate new releases.\n\nApple's customer base can be fiercely loyal, sometimes bordering on evangelical. The company enjoys high customer retention, another result of its brand equity. By retaining existing customers, Apple increases profit margins by lowering the amount it has to spend onmarketingto achieve the same sales volume. It costs less to retain an existing customer than to acquire a new one.\n\nThe concept of brand equity was first introduced in the 1980s by David Aaker, a marketing professor at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nA general example of the importance of brand equity is when a company wants to expand itsproduct line. If the brand's equity is positive, the likelihood that customers might buy its new product increases. Customers associate the new product with an existing, successful brand.\n\nFor example, if Campbell's releases a new soup, the company is likely to keep it under the same brand name rather than inventing a new one. The positive feelings and trust that generations of customers already have for the Campbell Soup Company (established in 1869) and its products make a new product more enticing compared to a soup associated with an unfamiliar brand name.\n\nHere are some other examples of companies with significant brand equity.\n\nManufactured since 1955, first by McNeil and then by subsidiaries ofJohnson & Johnson, Tylenol is a first-line treatment for mild to moderate pain.Tylenol has been able to grow its market with the creation of additional products that emphasize the brand: Tylenol Extra Strength, Tylenol Cold & Flu, Children's Tylenol, and Tylenol Sinus Congestion and Pain.\n\nStarted in 1995, Costco's Kirkland Signature brand has maintained positive growth and represents solid profit margins as well as a growing portion of the company's overall sales. This is an example of consumers forsaking more expensive products from well-known companies and flocking to Costco's typically lower-priced products because of their high quality and value.\n\nKirkland Signature encompasses hundreds of items, including clothing, coffee, laundry detergent, food, and beverages.Costcoalso provides members with exclusive access to cheaper gasoline at its private gas stations.\n\nRecognized as one of the most admired companies in the world byFortunemagazine in 2023,Starbucksis held in high regard for its pledge to social responsibility.With 40,199 stores operating around the globe, Starbucks remains a premier roaster and retailer of Arabica coffee beans and specialty coffees.\n\nWith profit margins from 23-32%,Coca-Colais often rated the most valuable soda brand in the world.However, the brand itself represents more than just products. It's symbolic of positive experiences and relationships, a proud history involving consumers, and even of the United States itself.\u00a0Also recognized for its unique marketing campaigns, the Coca-Cola\u00a0Corporation\u00a0has had a global impact on consumer engagement.\n\nPorsche, a brand\u00a0in the automobile sector with strong\u00a0equity, retains its image and reliability through the use of high quality, unique product materials. Viewed as aluxury brand, Porsche provides owners of its vehicles not only with a high quality car but a memorable experience. Compared to other vehicle brands in its class, Porsche was the top luxury car brand in 2025, according toU.S. News & World Report.\n\nBrand equity is a major indicator of a company's strength and performance, specifically in the public markets. Investors and analysts can look to brand equity as a gauge for potential stock performance. They may make brand equity a criterion for investment selection.\n\nOften, companies in the same industry or sector compete on brand equity. For example, two top companies\u2014Home Depot and Lowe's Home Improvement\u2014consistently rank as the top two home improvement store brands, as they did in 2025.\n\nA large component of brand equity in the hardware environment is consumer perception of the strength of a company'se-commercebusiness. Both Lowe's and Home Depot are industry leaders in this category. Besides e-commerce notability, both companies have high overall recognition among consumers, allowing them to further penetrate the industry and increase their brand equity.\n\nBrand equity is important for customer loyalty, which can translate to repeated and increasing sales despite higher-priced products or services. Brand equity is also important because it supports higher perceived value, greater customer satisfaction, and a more stable customer base. Simply put, consumers are more likely to choose a brand that they know and trust.\n\nThe elements of brand equity include:\n\nSeveral factors can affect brand equity. One is the quality of products or services. Consumers are more likely to have a positive perception of a brand if it consistently provides high-quality products or services. Consistent marketing and branding efforts are also important. These can help build and maintain apositive brand image. Customer experiences also matter. Positive experiences can lead to increased loyalty and positive brand associations. Brand reputation is also important, as consumers are more likely to choose a brand they perceive as trustworthy and reliable. Competition can also impact a brand's equity, as consumers may have multiple options to choose from. Finally, changes in consumer preferences or trends can affect a brand's equity, as consumers may shift towards different brands or products.\n\nBrand equity refers to the added value that a company earns from a product or a service. It is the positive perception or emotional attachment that consumers have towards a brand, which can influence their purchasing decisions and overall loyalty.\n\nBrand equity is created and built through consistentmarketing efforts, positive customer experiences, and the overall reputation of the brand. Companies with strong brand equity often have a competitive advantage in the market and can command higher prices for their products or services.\n\nCampbell's. \"About Campbell's.\"\n\nMayo Clinic. \"Chronic pain: Medication decisions.\"\n\nCostco. \"Costco Wholesale 2023 Annual Report,\" Page 8.\n\nStarbucks. \"Our Long-Standing Efforts To Put Our Partners First.\"\n\nStarbucks. \"Starbucks Fiscal 2024 Annual Report,\" Pages 3 and 7.\n\nYahoo Finance. \"The Coca-Cola Company Statistics.\"\n\nU.S. News & World Report. \"U.S. News Best Luxury Car Brands for 2025.\"\n\nLifestory Research. \"Ranked: 2025 America\u2019s Most Trusted Home Improvement Store Brand.\"",
