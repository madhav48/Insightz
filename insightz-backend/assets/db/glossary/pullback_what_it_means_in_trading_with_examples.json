  "term": "Pullback: What It Means in Trading, With Examples",
  "definition": "A pullback is a temporary dip in an otherwise rising stock price, often seen by investors as an opportunity to buy at a discount before the price continues upward.\n\nA pullback is a brief decline or pause in the generally upward price trend of a stock or other asset. Investors who are confident that the pullback will be brief use it as a buying opportunity. A pullback can occur for many reasons, some of which are unrelated to the fundamentals of the stock.\n\nTechnical analysts, who track the price movements of stocks to establish trends, identify the \"support level,\" or lowest price that a stock is likely to reach before buyers step back in.\n\nA pullback is similar to aretracement\u200b orconsolidation, and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The term pullback is usually applied to short-lived price declines, only a few consecutive sessions, before the uptrend resumes.\n\nPullbacks are widely seen as buying opportunities if the stock has been showing a generally upward price movement.\n\nFor example, many stocks experience a significant increase after a positive\u00a0earnings\u00a0announcement, followed by a sharp pullback as traders sell shares to take profits. Others step in to buy, seeing the positive earnings as a fundamental signal that the stock will resume its uptrend.\n\nMost pullbacks end when the stock's price drops to a level of technical\u00a0support, such as a moving average, pivot point, orFibonacci retracement level. Traders carefully watch these movements because a breakdown from the support levels could signal areversalrather than a pullback.\n\nPullbacks don\u2019t change the underlying fundamental narrative that is driving the price action on a chart. They are usually\u00a0profit-taking\u00a0opportunities following a strong run-up in a security\u2019s price.\n\nFor example, a company may report blow-out earnings and see shares jump 20%. The stock may experience a pullback the next day as short-term traders\u00a0lock in profits by selling some of their shares.\n\nHowever, the strong earnings report suggests that the business underlying the stock is doing something right. Buy-and-hold traders and investors will likely be attracted to the stock by the strong earnings reports, supporting a sustained uptrend in the near term.\n\nEvery stock chart has examples of pullbacks within the context of a prolonged uptrend. While these pullbacks are easy to spot in retrospect, they can be harder to assess for investors holding a security that\u2019s losing value.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nIn the example above, the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) experiences four pullbacks within the context of a prolonged trend higher. These pullbacks typically involved a move to near the 50-day\u00a0moving average,\u00a0where there was technical support, before a rebound higher.\n\nTraders often check several differenttechnical\u00a0indicatorswhen assessing pullbacks to ensure that they're unlikely to turn into longer-term reversals.\n\nPullbacks and reversals both involve a security moving off\u00a0its highs, but pullbacks are\u00a0temporary and reversals are long-term.\n\nSo how can traders distinguish between the two? Most reversals involve some change in a security\u2019s underlying\u00a0fundamentals\u00a0that force the market to re-evaluate its worth.\n\nFor example, a company may report disastrous earnings that make investors recalculate the stock\u2019s\u00a0net present value. Or, a competitor could release a superior product. Many events can have a long-term impact on the company underlying the stock.\n\nThese events will appear over several sessions and initially will look like a pullback.\n\nTraders use moving averages, trendlines, and trading bands to flag the point at which a pullback could continue and enter reversal territory.\n\nThere's no perfect method to distinguish a pullback from a reversal. For a few critical sessions, they look identical.\n\nIf the price action breaks the trendline for your time frame, you may be looking at a reversal rather than a pullback.\n\nThis is not the time to enter a bullish position. Of course, adding other technical indicators and fundamental data scans to the mix will increase a trader's confidence in distinguishing pullbacks from true reversals.\n\nIt's extremely difficult, if not impossible, to time the market correctly. But if you've done your research and believe a stock has long-term potential, a pullback can be an alert to buy at a better price.\n\nEven if you already own the stock or are ready to buy at the current price, stock prices fluctuate throughout the trading day, creating opportunities to buy. If there are no red flags regarding the company, buying a stock you like when it dips is a good way to potentially boost your gains.\n\nThe first place to look is at the fundamental story behind the uptrend. Presumably, you had reasons to buy shares of that stock. Are those reasons still good?\n\nWas the price decline caused by negative news about that company? Or did the stock just get caught in an overall market decline?\n\nYou can also monitor key technical support levels to see if they hold. If the price continues to decline, you might be looking at a more significant correction or even a reversal.\n\nLook at the fundamental story underpinning the uptrend. If nothing serious in the way of bad news has hit the security, you're likely looking at a mild pullback.\n\nTraders can use a variety of orders to take advantage of short-lived price drops. They can buy shares immediately using a buy market order or put in a limit buy order that will be triggered at a lower price.\n\nIn case prices move higher, traders can place a stop buy entry order at a level above the current price.\n\nDouble-check to make sure nothing has changed in the fundamental picture of the underlying stock. Next, take a look at trend and momentum indicators (e.g.,relative strength indexor RSI, average directional index or ADX, moving average convergence divergence, or MACD) to see if they're turning lower, potentially signaling a more significant decline.\n\nIf either of these conditions is met, take a step back and consider whether the uptrend has hit a significant high and tighten up your stop-loss sell order to minimize potential further losses.\n\nPullbacks are a normal part of any sustained uptrend. They can be triggered by profit-taking after a sudden surge higher in the price of a security, or minor negative news about the underlying security. Or maybe it's just a bad day on Wall Street for all concerned.\n\nTrend-following traders frequently use pullbacks to get in on the dominant uptrend or to buy more shares of a long-term winner. They can do this through buy limit orders, stop buy entry orders, or just a plain market order if they prefer to jump right in.",
