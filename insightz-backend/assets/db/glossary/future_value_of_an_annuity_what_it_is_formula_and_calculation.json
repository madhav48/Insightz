  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe future value of an annuity is the value of a group of recurring payments at a certain date in the future, assuming a particular rate of return, or adiscount rate. The higher the discount rate, the greater the annuity's future value. As long as all of the variables surrounding the annuity are known, such as payment amount, projected rate, and number of periods, it is possible tocalculate the future value of the annuity.\n\nBecause of thetime value of money, money received or paid out today is worth more than the same amount of money will be in the future. That's because the money can be invested and allowed to grow over time. By the same logic, a lump sum of $5,000 today is worth more than a series of five $1,000 annuity payments spread out over five years.\n\nThe formula for the future value of anordinary annuityis as follows. (An ordinary annuity pays interest at the end of a particular period, rather than at the beginning, as is the case with anannuity due.)\n\nP=PMT\u00d7((1+r)n\u22121)rwhere:P=Future\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0annuity\u00a0streamPMT=Dollar\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0annuity\u00a0paymentr=Interest\u00a0rate\u00a0(also\u00a0known\u00a0as\u00a0discount\u00a0rate)n=Number\u00a0of\u00a0periods\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0payments\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0made\\begin{aligned} &\\text{P} = \\text{PMT} \\times \\frac { \\big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \\big ) }{ r } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{P} = \\text{Future value of an annuity stream} \\\\ &\\text{PMT} = \\text{Dollar amount of each annuity payment} \\\\ &r = \\text{Interest rate (also known as discount rate)} \\\\ &n = \\text{Number of periods in which payments will be made} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bP=PMT\u00d7r((1+r)n\u22121)\u200bwhere:P=Future\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0an\u00a0annuity\u00a0streamPMT=Dollar\u00a0amount\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0annuity\u00a0paymentr=Interest\u00a0rate\u00a0(also\u00a0known\u00a0as\u00a0discount\u00a0rate)n=Number\u00a0of\u00a0periods\u00a0in\u00a0which\u00a0payments\u00a0will\u00a0be\u00a0made\u200b\n\nOrdinary annuities are more common, but an annuity due will result in a higher future value, all else being equal.\n\nWith an annuity due, payments are made at the beginning of each period. So the formula is slightly different. To find the future value of an annuity due, simply multiply the formula above by (1 + r):\n\nP=PMT\u00d7((1+r)n\u22121)r\u00d7(1+r)\\begin{aligned} &\\text{P} = \\text{PMT} \\times \\frac { \\big ( (1 + r) ^ n - 1 \\big ) }{ r } \\times ( 1 + r ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bP=PMT\u00d7r((1+r)n\u22121)\u200b\u00d7(1+r)\u200b\n\nLet's say someone decides to invest $125,000 per year for the next five years in an annuity that they expect tocompoundat 8% per year.\n\nIn this example, the series of payments is a regular annuity in which the payments are made at the end of each period. Theexpected future valueof this payment stream using the above formula is as follows:\n\nFuture\u00a0value=$125,000\u00d7((1+0.08)5\u22121)0.08=$733,325\\begin{aligned} \\text{Future value} &= \\$125,000 \\times \\frac { \\big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \\big ) }{ 0.08 } \\\\ &= \\$733,325 \\\\ \\end{aligned}Future\u00a0value\u200b=$125,000\u00d70.08((1+0.08)5\u22121)\u200b=$733,325\u200b\n\nLet's use the same example as above, but with\u00a0an annuity due. This means that each of the $125,000 payments was made at the beginning of each period. Its future value would be calculated as follows:\n\nFuture\u00a0value=$125,000\u00d7((1+0.08)5\u22121)0.08\u00d7(1+0.08)=$791,991\\begin{aligned} \\text{Future value} &= \\$125,000 \\times \\frac { \\big ( ( 1 + 0.08 ) ^ 5 - 1 \\big ) }{ 0.08 } \\times ( 1 + 0.08 ) \\\\ &= \\$791,991 \\\\ \\end{aligned}Future\u00a0value\u200b=$125,000\u00d70.08((1+0.08)5\u22121)\u200b\u00d7(1+0.08)=$791,991\u200b\n\nAll else being equal, the future value of an annuity due will be greater than the future value of an ordinary annuity because the money has had an extra period to accumulate compounded interest. In this example, the future value of the annuity due is $58,666 more than that of the ordinary annuity.\n\nWhen calculating future values, one component of the calculation is called thefuture valuefactor. The future value factor is the aggregated growth that alump sumor series of cash flow will entail. For example, if the future value of $1,000 is $1,100, the future value factor must have been 1.1. A future value factor of 1.0 means the value of the series will be equal to the value today.\n\nAnnuity payments are typically made at the end of a period. An annuity due, however, is a payment that is made at the beginning of a period. Though it may not seem like much of a distinction, there may be considerable differences between the two when considering what interest is accrued.\n\nPresent value and future valueindicate the value of an investment looking forward or looking back. The two concepts are directly related, as the future value of a series of cash flows also has a present value. For example, a present value of $1,000 today may be equal to the future value of $1,200 today.\n\nMost often, investors and analysts will know one value and try to solve for the other. For instance, if you buy astocktoday for $100 that awards a 2% dividend each year, you can calculate the future value of that stock. Alternatively, if you want to have $10,000 of future value on hand fora down payment for a carnext year, you can solve for the present value.\n\nAn annuity is a series of payments made over a period of time, often for the same amount each period. Investors can determine the future value of their annuity by considering the annuity amount, projected rate of return, and number of periods. There are also implications as to whether the annuity payments are made at the beginning or at the end of a period.",
