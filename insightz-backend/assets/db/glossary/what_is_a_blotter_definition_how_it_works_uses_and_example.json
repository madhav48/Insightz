  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA blotter (also called a deal blotter or trade blotter) is a physical or digital record of all trades made over a period of time (usually one trading day) along with their relevant details.\n\nThe purpose of a trade blotter is to carefully document trades so that they can be reviewed and confirmed by a trader or brokerage firm. The blotter is mainly used in the stock market, foreign exchange market, and the bond market. It can be customized based on the needs of the user. A trade blotter is also used in the options andcommodity markets.\n\nThe details of a trade will include such things as the time, price, order size, and a specification of whether it was a buy or sell order. This serves as anaudit trailof transactions and is helpful to review if a particular trading strategy utilized was successful.\n\nWhile blotters used to be written down on large boards or paper spreadsheets, today they are usually created throughtrading softwareprograms that automatically record the trades made through a data feed.\n\nA broker usually provides a blotter to its traders as a software program. It includes what security was traded, the time of trade, the quantity and price of sale or purchase, theECN marketthe trade occurred over, and whether it was a buy, sell, or short order.\n\nThe blotter also indicates whether a trade was settled appropriately and includes orders that were entered but canceled before being filled. The trader can customize what details are to be shown on the blotter. A broker uses a blotter to keep a record of all transactions in the event that any issue with a trade arises.\n\nA blotter can be used with or in place of a trading journal by traders who utilize it to improve theirtrading techniquesandstrategies. At the end of a trading day, traders will usually use the blotter to review how well they performed. They can sort through the blotter to review areas in which they could have performed better, such as timing with entries and/or exits.\n\nCompliance departments and regulators, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), also sort the blotter to detect whether any illegal trading has been done. The sorting can be done in numerous ways to reveal any discrepancies in trading.\n\nDuring an SEC audit, trading blotters are used by firms to show arecord of their tradesby type of investment. A separate trading blotter will be used for equities, for example, and another one for fixed-income securities, and so on.\n\nIf some trades were carried out on stocks on thewatchlist, or restricted trading list, this might indicateinsider trading. Blotters might also reveal that some portfolio managers are showing favoritism to select clients if the following (or other information) is revealed:\n\nFurthermore, a portfolio manager involved in an investment strategy that deviates from the strategy disclosed to clients may be found out through a blotter. One example of a red flag is when a supposed buy-and-hold investment portfolio actually has only short-term traded securities.\n\nAny unusual trading activity highlighted on a blotter will be investigated further to determine whether any wrongdoing was carried out.\n\nLet's say that investment firm ABC is preparing for an SEC audit. It separates out its trades by type of investment and generates a trading blotter for each investment for the time period requested by the SEC. Each spreadsheet (usually using Excel) contains details of the trade as categorized below.\n\nIn the case of fixed-income securities, such as bonds, an additional column called \"Accrued Interest\" is added to the sheet.\n\nAll blotters are considered blotters of original entry as they all record new information. The different types of blotters, such as those for the receipt and delivery of securities, for the purchase and sale of securities, and the disbursements of cash, all fall under blotters of original entry.\n\nA trade blotter simply records the trading activity of an individual and by doing so creates a trading history. Information in a trade blotter includes the client name, the trade name, the settlement date, if the trade was a buy or sell, the CUSIP, the security symbol, the quantity purchased, the unit price, and more.\n\nA variety of activities can trigger an insider trading investigation by the SEC. This usually occurs around some large news event, such as before a merger or acquisition, where the SEC or other regulatory agencies look for unusual movement in a specific security.\n\nBlotters are records of trades and are used for organizational purposes and tracking. They're also useful for when adjustments or updates need to be made as well as being useful in spotting illegal trading. Like any type of record, blotters can be designed and applied in a variety of contexts.",
