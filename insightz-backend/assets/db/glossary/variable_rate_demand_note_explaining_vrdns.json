  "term": "Variable Rate Demand Note: Explaining VRDNs",
  "definition": "A variable-rate demand note (VRDN), or variable-rate demand obligation (VRDO) is a debt instrument that represents borrowed funds that are payable on demand and accrue interest based on a prevailing money market rate, such as the prime rate. The interest rate applicable to the borrowed funds is specified from the outset of the debt and is typically equal to the specified money market rate plus an extra margin.\n\nA VRDN is also referred to as a variable rate demand obligation (VRDO).\n\nA variable-rate demand note (VRDN) is a long-termmunicipal bondwhich is offered to investors throughmoney market funds. The notes allow a municipal government to borrow money for long periods of time while paying short-term interest rates to investors. As VRDNs are issued in a minimum of $100,000 denominations, smaller investors can only invest in VRDOs indirectly through money market funds.\n\nBecause money market interest rates, such as the bankprime rate, are variable over time, the interest rate applicable to a variable rate demand note is variable as well. Every time the prevailing money market rate changes, a variable rate demand note's interest rate is adjusted accordingly. Typically, the interest rate on VRDN is adjusted daily, weekly, or monthly to reflect the current interest rate environment.\n\nVariable-rate demand obligations account for about 76% of the securities in money market funds, according to asset manager BlackRock.\n\nAs the name implies, variable rate demand notes are payable on demand as they have an embeddedput option. This means that the investor or lender of the funds can request a repayment of the entire debt amount at his or her discretion, and the funds must be repaid once the demand has been made. Depending on the demand feature affixed to these debt instruments, the investor may be required to provide a one-day or seven-day notification to tender the securities to a financial intermediary, such as atrusteeor remarketing agent. Because of the demand feature, thematurity dateof a VRDN is considered to be the next put date rather than its final maturity date.\n\nAnother feature of the VRDN that makes it an attractive investment option for money market investors is thecredit enhancementthat supports the demand note. A credit enhancement is a feature added to a security to improve its credit profile and mitigatedefault riskof the underlying assets. VRDN issuers employ credit enhancements throughletters of credit(LOCs) from a highly rated financial institution, which serves as the liquidity provider of last resort, committed to supporting the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal on tendered securities. As long as the financial institution providing the letter of credit is solvent, the investor will receive payment.\n\nFor this reason, the interest rate on VRDNs tends to reflect the short-term credit rating of the bank providing the letter of credit rather than the municipality issuing the VRDN. Another form of credit enhancement that may be used to reduce default risk is a standbybond purchase agreementwhich is typically provided by a reputable bank.\n\nVariable-rate demand notes produce returns that have lowcorrelationswith stocks and bonds, thus, making them good investments for portfoliodiversification. In addition, VRDNs issued by municipalities are generally exempt from federal taxes. Many issues are also exempt from state taxes in the state of issue.\n\nVariable-rate demand obligations are typically sold with a minimum investment of $100,000, putting them out of the reach of most individual investors. However, retail investors can gain exposure to these instruments by buying shares of a mutual fund that invests in municipal securities.\n\nLike other municipal bonds, the interest from variable-rate demand obligations is typically exempt from federal tax, and sometimes state tax. This means that they are also subject to strict requirements by the IRS.\n\nVariable rate demand obligations are designed with a \"put\" feature that allows bondholders to redeem them before they mature. This option can be exercised at specified intervals, usually when interest rates are reset. If a bondholder exercises this option, their option will usually be remarketed to another investor. If a new investor cannot be found, a \"failed remarketing\" occurs, and the bonds will be sold to a predetermined financial institution. VRDO issues are typically accompanied by a liquidity facility from a financial institution to provide sufficient liquidity for this contingency.\n\nVariable-rate demand notes are municipal bonds with a floating interest rate, allowing city and state governments to borrow money over long periods of time. Most investors can access these securities through money market and municipal bond funds. VRDN issuers partner with larger financial institutions for credit and liquidity, allowing them to borrow for lower interest rates.\n\nBlackRock. \"Understanding Variable Rate Demand Notes.\"\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \"Overview of Municipal Bonds.\"",
