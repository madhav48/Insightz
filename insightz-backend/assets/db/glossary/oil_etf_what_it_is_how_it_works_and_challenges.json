  "definition": "An oil ETF is anexchange-traded fund(ETF) which invests in companies engaged in the oil and gas industry. Companies featured in the ETF basket include discovery, production, distribution, and retail businesses as well as the commodity itself. Some oil ETFs may becommodity pools, with limited partnership interests instead of shares. These\u00a0pools invest in derivative contracts such asfuturesand options.\n\nAn oil ETF offers advantages to those wanting to participate in oil markets and reap the potential profits without the logistics of handling single energy-related stocks.

However, the volatile oil industry is a favorite\u00a0investment and trading sector. With an oil ETF, the investors are not dealing in futures, so physical inventory isn't a concern. This option provides a convenient way for investors interested in getting into the oil market to participate.\n\nThe benchmark target for an oil ETF may be a market index of oil companies or the spot price of crude itself.
