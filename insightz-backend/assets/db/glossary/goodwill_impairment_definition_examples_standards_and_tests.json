Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nGoodwill impairment is an accounting charge that companies record when goodwill\u2019scarrying valueon financial statements exceeds its fair value. In accounting,goodwillis recorded after a company acquiresassetsandliabilities, and pays a price in excess of their identifiable net value.\n\nGoodwill impairment arises when there is a deterioration in the capabilities of acquired assets to generate cash flows, and thefair valueof the goodwill dips below itsbook value.\n\nMichela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nGoodwillimpairmentis an earnings charge that companies record on theirincome statementsafter they identify that there is persuasive evidence that the asset associated with the goodwill can no longer demonstrate financial results that were expected from it at the time of its purchase.\n\nGoodwill is anintangible assetcommonly associated with the purchase of one company by another. Specifically, goodwill is recorded in a situation in which the purchase price is higher than the net of the fair value of all identifiabletangibleand intangible assets and liabilities assumed in the process of anacquisition. The value of a company\u2019s brand name, solid customer base, good customer relations, good employee relations, and anypatentsorproprietary technologyrepresent some examples of goodwill.\n\nBecause many companies acquire other firms and pay a price that exceeds the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities that the acquired firm possesses, the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of acquired assets is recorded as goodwill. However, if unforeseen circumstances arise that decrease expected cash flows from acquired assets, the goodwill recorded can have a current fair value that is lower than what was originally booked, and the company must record a goodwill impairment.\n\nGoodwill impairment became an issue during the accounting scandals of 2000\u20132001. Many firms artificially inflated theirbalance sheetsby reporting excessive values of goodwill, which was allowed at that time to beamortizedover its estimated useful life.Amortizing an intangible assetover its useful life decreases the amount of expense booked related to that asset in any single year.\n\nWhilebull marketspreviously overlooked goodwill and similar manipulations, the accounting scandals and change in rules forced companies to report goodwill at realistic levels. Currentaccounting standardsrequire public companies to perform annual tests on goodwill impairment, and goodwill is no longer amortized.\n\nU.S.generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)require companies to review their goodwill for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level.Events that may trigger goodwill impairment include deterioration in economic conditions, increased competition, loss of key personnel, and regulatory action.\n\nThe definition of a reporting unit plays a crucial role during the test; it is defined as the business unit that a company\u2019s management reviews and evaluates as a separate segment. Reporting units typically represent distinct business lines, geographic units, or subsidiaries.\n\nThe basic procedure governing goodwill impairment tests is set out by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)in \u201cAccounting Standards Update No. 2017-04,\u00a0Intangibles\u2014Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the most famous goodwill impairment charge was the $54.2 billion reported in 2002 for the AOL Time Warner Inc. merger.This was, at the time, the largest goodwill impairment loss ever reported by a company.\n\nCompanies record goodwill impairment as an earnings charge on their income statements. This happens after they identify persuasive evidence that the asset associated with the goodwill can no longer demonstrate financial results expected from it at the time of its purchase.\n\nGoodwill is an\u00a0intangible asset\u00a0that is recorded when one company is purchased by another. It is the portion of the purchase price that is higher than the sum of the net fair value of all of the assets purchased in the acquisition and the liabilities assumed in the process.\n\nIn the U.S., generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require companies to review their goodwill for impairment at least once a year at a reporting unit level. Catalysts for goodwill impairment include increased competition, economic deterioration, loss of key personnel, and regulatory action.\n\nGoodwill impairment is an accounting charge incurred when the fair value of goodwill drops below the previously recorded value from the time of an acquisition. Goodwill inaccountingis recorded after a company acquires assets and liabilities, and pays a price in excess of their identifiable net value.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cAccounting for Goodwill Impairment.\u201d\n\nKPMG, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cShould Goodwill Amortisation Be Reintroduced?\u201d\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cSummary of Statement No. 141.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cForm 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December\u00a031, 2002: AOL Time Warner Inc.,\u201d Page F-80.\n\nTime. \u201cWhat AOL Time Warner\u2019s $54 Billion Loss Means.\u201d",
