It shows how easily a company can payintereston its outstandingdebt. The ratio divides a company\u2019searnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)by its interest expense over a specific period.\n\nThe interest coverage ratio may be called thetimes interest earned (TIE) ratio. It helps lenders, investors, and creditors determine a company\u2019s riskiness for future borrowing.\n\nInterest\u00a0Coverage\u00a0Ratio=EBITInterest\u00a0Expensewhere:EBIT=Earnings\u00a0before\u00a0interest\u00a0and\u00a0taxes\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Interest Coverage Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expense}}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{EBIT}=\\text{Earnings before interest and taxes} \\end{aligned}\u200bInterest\u00a0Coverage\u00a0Ratio=Interest\u00a0ExpenseEBIT\u200bwhere:EBIT=Earnings\u00a0before\u00a0interest\u00a0and\u00a0taxes\u200b\n\nThe \u201ccoverage\u201d represents the number of times a company can successfullypay its obligationswith its earnings.A low ratio may signal that the company has high debt expenses with minimal capital. For example, when a company\u2019s interest coverage ratio is 1.5 or lower, it can only cover its obligations a maximum of one and a half times. Its ability to meet interest expenses may be questionable in the long run.\n\nCompanies need earnings to cover interest payments and survive unforeseeable financial hardships. A company\u2019s ability to meet its interest obligations is an aspect of itssolvencyand a factor in the return forshareholders.\n\nWhen corporate interest rates rise, interest coverage ratios may decline. Rising rates limit profits and hurt a company\u2019s ability to borrow, invest, and hire new employees.\n\nWhen a company struggles with its obligations, it may borrow or dip into its cash reserves, a source forcapital assetinvestment or required for emergencies. Analyzing interest coverage ratios over time will often give a clearer picture of a company\u2019s position and trajectory.\n\nLooking at a company\u2019s ratios every quarter over many years lets investors know whether the ratio is improving, declining, or stable. Some banks or potential bond buyers may be comfortable with a less desirable ratio in exchange for charging the company a higher interest rate on their debt.\n\nSuppose a company\u2019s earnings for the first quarter are $625,000 with monthly debt payments of $30,000. To calculate the interest coverage ratio, convert the monthly interest payments into quarterly payments by multiplying by three.\n\nThe interest coverage ratio is $625,000 / $90,000 ($30,000 \u00d7 3) = 6.94. This indicates the company has noliquidityissues and can cover almost seven times its obligations.\n\nAn interest coverage ratio of 1.5 is low, and lenders may refuse to lend the company more money, as the company\u2019srisk of defaultmay be perceived as high. If a company\u2019s ratio is below one, it will likely need to spend some of itscash reservesto meet the difference or borrow more.\n\nA company\u2019s ratio should be evaluated against others in the same industry or those with similarbusiness modelsandrevenuenumbers. However, companies may isolate or exclude certain types of debt in their interest coverage ratio calculations. As such, when considering a company\u2019s self-published interest coverage ratio, determine if all debts are included.\n\nA good ratio indicates that a company can service the interest on its debts using its earnings or has shown the ability to maintain revenues at a consistent level. A well-established utility will likely have consistent production and revenue due to government regulation. Even if it has a relatively low ratio, it may reliably cover its interest payments. Other industries, such as manufacturing, are much more volatile and mayoften have a minimum acceptable interest coverage ratioof three or higher.\n\nA poor interest coverage ratio, such as below one, means the company\u2019s current earnings are insufficient to service its\u00a0outstanding debt. The chances of a company being able to continue to meet itsinterest expenseson an ongoing basis are doubtful.\n\nThe interest coverage ratio, or times interest earned (TIE) ratio, shows how well a company can pay the interest on its debts. It is calculated by dividing EBIT, EBITDA, or EBIAT by a period\u2019s interest expense. Interest coverage ratios vary across industries.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Boston. \u201cInterest Expenses, Coverage Ratio, and Firm Distress.\u201d",
