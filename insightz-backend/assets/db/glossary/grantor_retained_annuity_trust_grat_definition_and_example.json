  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA grantor retained annuity trust (GRAT) is anestate planningtool used to minimize taxes on large financial gifts made to family members. It can avoid using much (if any) of the lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nAnirrevocable trustis created for a certain period in which assets are placed. Anannuityis then paid out to the grantor each year. The beneficiary receives the assets and pays little or no gift taxes when the trust expires and the last annuity payment is made.\n\nTwo types of taxes can be imposed when an individual dies. Theestate taxapplies to the value of everything the decedent owned or had a financial interest in at the time of death. It's paid from the estate.Gift taxesare imposed on the value of anything given away during the decedent's lifetime for which they didn't receive payment or value in return.\n\nThese taxes share a lifetime exemption. The value of the estate is added to the value of taxable gifts made during the decedent's lifetime but tax isn't payable on the entire amount. The IRS provides a lifetime gift and estate tax exclusion that can be subtracted from the overall value.\n\nThis exclusion is $13.99 million in 2025, which is an increase from the $13.61 million exclusion in 2024.Gifts and an estate valued at $14 million would pay tax on only $100,000 in 2025 and $390,000 in 2024. Gifts and an estate valued at $13 million would not be liable for any of the tax at all.\n\nAn annual exclusion also applies to gifts. You can give away up to $19,000 in 2025 and $18,000 in 2024 per year per person free of taxation. You can apply the balance, if any, to your lifetime exclusion or you can pay the associated tax in the year you make the gift.\n\nA grantor retained annuity trust is a type of irrevocable trust that allows the individual who created it, referred to as thegrantor or trust maker, to potentially pass a significant amount of wealth to the next generation with little or no gift tax cost.\n\nGRATs are established for a specific number of years. The grantor transfers ownership of assets to a trust when creating a GRAT but they retain a right to receive the original value of the assets they've contributed. They can receive the value over the term of the GRAT while earning a rate of return known as the 7520 rate that's specified by the IRS.\n\nThe leftover assets are given to the grantor's beneficiaries when the GRAT's term expires. This is essentially any appreciation of the original assets minus the IRS-assumed return rate.\n\nThe annuity payments from a GRAT come from interest earned on the assets placed within the trust or as a percentage of the total value of the assets. The beneficiary receives nothing, however, if the individual who establishes the trust dies before it expires. The assets become part of the taxable estate of the individual in this case, effectively making the GRAT useless.\n\nA successful GRAT also assumes that the assets appreciate so the GRAT doesn't work well if there'sdepreciation. There is also a risk with the IRS's 7520 rate. It's been so low in the millennium that it's reduced the ultimate advantage of using a GRAT.\n\nGRATs are most useful to wealthy individuals who face significant estate tax liability at death. A GRAT may be used to freeze the value of their estate by shifting a portion or all of the appreciation onto their heirs. An individual could transfer the difference to their children tax-free if they had an asset worth $10 million but expected it to grow to $12 million over the next two years.\n\nThe value of the remainder interest is also included in the grantor's estate if the grantor dies during the term of the GRAT. The right to receive any remaining annuity payments may be passed from the grantor to a surviving spouse who can qualify for the estate tax marital deduction.Any estate tax liability related to the GRAT assets could be eliminated.\n\nGRATs are especially popular with individuals who own shares in startup companies because stock price appreciation for IPO shares will usually far outpace the IRS assumed rate of return. More money can be passed to children without eating into the grantor's lifetime exclusion from estate and gift taxes.\n\nGRATs saw a big surge in popularity in 2000 as a result of a favorable ruling in the U.S. Tax Court involving the Walton family of Walmart fame. The court ruled in favor of Walton's use of two GRATs in Audrey J. Walton v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue.Annuity payments were set up in the GRATs to return all the original assets to the grantor and leave only theappreciated valueto beneficiaries.\n\nThe value of the gift originally placed in trust is reduced to zero in this way. Any remaining value in the trust is transferred to the beneficiary tax-free. This use of GRATs is known as a zeroed-out GRAT or Walton GRAT.\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg put his company's pre-IPO stock into a GRAT before it went public. The exact numbers aren't known butForbesran estimated numbers and came up with an impressive figure as the value of Zuckerberg's stock: over $37.32 million.\n\nAn irrevocable trust can't easily be changed after being established, which means the creator or grantor can't undo it. Once placed into the trust, any assets cannot be removed. Since they've been given away to the trust, the grantor no longer owns them, which means they aren't included in the grantor's estate when they die.\n\nThe estate isn't responsible for the gift tax. The grantor may be subject to a gift tax, however, when they give the assets away and fund them into the trust.\n\nThese transfers are technically gifts, subject to the annual and lifetime IRS exclusions. The beneficiaries would not be liable for the tax, however, so a GRAT can still serve a purpose on their behalves.\n\nThe 7520 rate is a provision found in Section 7520 of theInternal Revenue Code (IRC). It applies to some charitable interests that are held in a trust. It works out to an interest rate that\u2019s 120% of the federal midterm rate for the month in which a valuation takes place. The rate is rounded off to the closest two-tenths of a percent.\n\nBeneficiaries are liable for the inheritance tax if the grantor dies during the term. It's directly payable by the beneficiary of an inheritance rather than by the trust or estate giving the inheritance so forming a GRAT wouldn't affect it. While the federal government doesn't impose this type of tax, only six states do so: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Philadelphia.\n\nA GRAT is a form of irrevocable trust that\u2019s not intended to last through the lifetime of the person who establishes and funds it. GRATS have limited lifespans of a certain number of years. They can be used to transfer assets while minimizing gift tax liability. They\u2019re often used by wealthy individuals whose assets are of a value that\u2019s more than the lifetime estate and gift tax exclusion provided by the IRS. Always seek professional legal help if you\u2019re thinking of setting up a trust, particularly an irrevocable trust. As the name suggests, you can\u2019t easily undo a revocable trust if you later change your mind or make a mistake in its formation.\n\nIRS. \"Estate and Gift Tax FAQs.\"\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \"Understanding Federal Estate and Gift Taxes.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Estate Tax.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service.IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Section 7520 Interest Rates.\"\n\nJournal of Accountancy. \"Great Time for a GRAT.\"\n\nThompson Reuters, Casetext. \"Walton v.
