  "definition": "The two-bin inventory control system is a technique companies use to ensure that they always have the right level of stock to meet demand.\n\nA company\u2019s two-bin inventory system requires that an order be placed to replace items in a first inventory bin when they\u2019ve been deleted through production. A second bin should be in place to hold enough items to transfer to the first and last until the order for the first bin arrives. The first bin has a minimum of working stock and the second bin maintains reserve stock or remaining material.\n\nThe two-bin inventory control method is also sometimes referred to askanban, which is strongly associated with thejust-in-time(JIT) method of a manufacturing process.\n\nEffectively managing stock levels is one of the biggest challenges that companies face. Not having enoughinventorycan result in missing out on sales opportunities and losing out to competitors. Holding too much stock, on the other hand, increases the possibility of damage, spoilage, theft, and falling victim to shifts indemand. It also means higher storage costs and delays in recouping money from purchased goods to reinvest in the business.\n\nThe two-bin inventory control system is a basic technique used to ensure that companies reduce these risks and always have, more or less, the right level of stock to meet demand without overdoing it.\n\nIn its simplest form, the process can be broken down like this:\n\nThis system is broadly employed across different industries that involve\u00a0manufacturing operations and is also effective for hospital inventory control.\n\nTwo-bin inventory control is almost always used for small or low-value items that can be easily purchased and stored in bulk. In contrast, higher-value items are subject to theperpetual inventorysystem.\n\nMoreover, depending on historical patterns of variance in thedepletion rate of the working stock (bin no. 1), the amount ordered for the reserve stock (bin no. 2) can be adjusted.\n\nIt is essential that the new order placed after the first bin is emptied arrives before the second bin is empty, otherwise, the process does not work as intended. The inventory approach used for both bins isfirst in, first out(FIFO), given that the inventory placed in the first bin is also the inventory that is first sold.\n\nIn general, the following calculation is used to determine how much inventory to keep in the reserve stock bin:\n\n(Daily usage rate *lead time) +\u00a0safety stock\n\nCompany A is a small manufacturer that goes through various types of nuts and bolts to piece together its products. Fasteners are among the many items it orders from outside suppliers. It uses roughly 800 of them per week, or 160 per day, with a lead time\u2014the period between the beginning and completion of a production process\u2014of three days.\n\nAccording to the first calculation above, company A\u2019s reserve bin should stock at least 480 fasteners. However, management is also aware that usage levels can sometimes fluctuate by as much as 15%, so as a precautionary measure chooses to add some more fasteners to its reserve storage bin. This safety stock could come in handy if demand picks up and production rates increase, as they have in the past.",
