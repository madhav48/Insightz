  "term": "Education Loan: Definition, Types, Debt Strategies",
  "definition": "An education loan is a sum of money borrowed to finance a post-secondary education or higher education-related expenses. Education loans are intended to cover the cost of tuition, books and supplies, and living expenses while the borrower is in the process of pursuing a degree.\n\nPayments are often deferred while students are in college and, depending on the lender, for an additional six-month period after earning a degree. This deferment period is also referred to as a \"grace period.\"\n\nEducation loans are issued for the purpose of attending an accredited college or a university to pursue an academic degree. Education loans can be obtained from the government or through private-sector lending sources.\n\nFederal loans often have lower interest rates, and some also offer subsidized interest (meaning the United States Department of Education pays the interest on the loan while a student is in college at least half-time).Private-sector loans generally follow more of a traditional lending process, with rates that aretypically higherthan those of federal loans.\n\nMost borrowers first seekfederal government financingif they need to borrow funds for education expenses. The first step in seeking education loans through the federal government is to complete aFree Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA).Depending on the applicant's status, particularly in regard to their parental dependency, additional information may be required to complete the application. A credit check is not generally required as part of the application process.\n\nThe amount of principal on the loan or loans is primarily based on the cost of attendance at the school the student is planning on attending. Once a FAFSA form is completed, the schools listed on the FAFSA application work to identify the financial aid package that the student is eligible for.\n\nSeveral types of federal student loans exist, includingdirect subsidized, direct unsubsidized, anddirect consolidation loans. If offered and accepted, funds will be issued by the federal government to the specified university to cover the student's academic costs. If there are remaining funds available, they will be disbursed to the student. A student may use these funds to cover other expenses that they incur while pursuing a degree.\n\nIf a student qualifies for subsidized loans, the borrower\u2019s interest will be covered while they're in school. If a student qualifies for unsubsidized loans, the interest on their loans will bedeferredas long as they're enrolled in classes and remain in good academic standing.\n\nIn some cases, the student loan package that a student is issued through the federal government may suggest that the borrower applies foradditional funds through private lenders. Private student loans also include state-affiliated\u00a0lending nonprofits and institutional loans provided by the schools.\n\nThese types of loans will generally follow a more standard application process for a private-sector loan. Applications for private student loans typically require a credit check.\n\nBorrowers can apply directly to individual private-sector lenders. Similar to federal funds, the approved loan amount will be influenced by the school a borrower is attending. If approved, funds for educational expenses will first be disbursed to the school to cover any pending bills; the remaining amount is then sent directly to the borrower.\n\nAccumulated debt from college can be an overwhelming burden after graduation. If a student has taken out numerous education loans,consolidating them can be a good optionfor more easily managing the debt load. Multiple federal education loans can be combined into a single direct consolidation loan.\n\nAdditionally, many private lenders now allow borrowers to combine both their federal and private loans into one loan. It's important to note that in this scenario, the new loan would be a private one since it'd be issued by a private lender. Because the loan will be considered a private loan, the debt wouldno longer be eligible for certain federal programsforloan forgivenessand repayment.There's no option for borrowers to combine private and federal loans into a new federal loan.\n\nA number of employers also include consolidation services and student loan repayment programs into their employee benefit package as a way of increasing the support available for managing student loan debt after college.\n\nStudents and their families should consider all of their options before signing up for more education debt than they need, as that could become a crushing burden in the future. Some alternatives to\u2014or ways to reduce the need for\u2014education loans include working part-time, accepting work-study offers, attending a less expensive school, finding a job that offerstuition reimbursement, and applying for scholarships. Once the student has graduated, it can also help to search for a job that offers student debt repayment assistance as a benefit.\n\nSometimes, you may still end up withmore student loan fundsthan you need. Perhaps a relative unexpectedly put money toward your education, or you were awarded a scholarship that you hadn't planned to receive. It's tempting to use any excess student loan funds fordiscretionary expenses, but the ethical and financially sound approach is to put these funds to pay down your debt. Plus, in the case of government-subsidized loans, you could face legal repercussions if you misuse these funds.\n\nStudent loans are considered unsecured installment debts, meaning there isn't a physical asset tied to them, and they're paid back in a set number of installments overan agreed-upon period of time.\n\nThere are four types of federal student loans available as part of the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program:\n\nThere areseveral ways to better manage student debt. Three particularly useful strategies include paying off loans with the highest interest rates first, paying down extra principal whenever possible, and exploring operations for debt forgiveness.\n\nEducation loans are a vital asset for helping students afford the cost of a higher education. However, if taken out recklessly, they can burden borrowers with more debt than they can reasonably repay.\n\nBefore taking on student debt, review the full financial aid package from your school of choice and accept any available scholarships and/or work-study offers. Consider also using online search tools tofind additional scholarshipsyou may qualify for.\n\nIf you still have funding gaps, it's time to consider federal loans. Should you decide to take on student debt, don't agree to more than you need. If you require even more money after taking these steps, then applying for private loans may be a good idea.\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"The U.S. Department of Education Offers Low-Interest Loans to Eligible Students to Help Cover the Cost of College or Career School.\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"2025\u201326 FAFSA\u00ae Form Now Available!\"\n\nFederal Student Aid. \"I Filled Out My FAFSA Form.
