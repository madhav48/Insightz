  "definition": "Islamic banking is a system of finance that adheres to Sharia law, which advocates profit-sharing while prohibiting the collection and payment of interest.\n\nIslamic banking is a financial system that adheres to the principles of Sharia\u00a0law. Islamic banking prohibits the use of\u00a0interest, speculation, and excessive risk. It emphasizes profit and loss sharing, fairness, honesty, and transparency in financial dealings.\n\nIslamic\u00a0banking, or Islamic finance, strives to remove harm from financial transactions. Both Muslims and non-Muslims can participate in Islamic banking and benefit from its principles.\n\nThe global Islamic\u00a0banking\u00a0and finance market is worth $8.94 billion as of 2025 and is expected to grow by 11.6% to $13.89 billion by 2029.The Middle East and Africa region is the largestmarket, while the Asia-Pacific region is poised to show the most growth. Increasing demand for Sharia-compliant\u00a0financial services\u00a0from a younger and growing Muslim population is driving growth in the industry.\n\nThe countries with the highest growth in this\u00a0area of finance\u00a0include:\n\nAccording to a 2024 report by Global Finance Magazine, Iraq had the most Islamicbanks, with 15, followed by Bahrain (7) and Qatar (5). Sudan and Saudi Arabia's Islamic financial institutions held the most assets at $484.0 billion and $322.2 billion, respectively.\n\nIslamic bankingaims to make\u00a0finance\u00a0more equitable by keeping fairness and\u00a0transparency\u00a0at the forefront of all transactions. It works on several key principles, including:\n\nLending\u00a0takes on a different form under Islamic banking principles. Rather than providinginterest-based loans, these institutions use equity participation in their lending practices. For instance, rather than\u00a0finance\u00a0the purchase of a home, an Islamic\u00a0bank\u00a0buys the property and either\u00a0leases\u00a0or sells it to the client in exchange for a fixed installment payment.\n\nAccording to the Quran, financial transactions should reflect good governance that specifically includes transparency and accountability.It suggests that wealth should be \"supportive\" to all community members and that people should avoid indulging in excesses. The use of money should lift others rather than cause harm to others.\n\nEvidence exists of applying religious principles to business and financial transactions\u2014calledfiqh al-muamalat. Financial activities that fall under Islamic banking principles include buying and selling,investing, contracts, and saving.\n\nAll transactions should adhere to Sharia and be transparent and fair to all parties involved. Another key component is that any financial transaction should have mutual consent, which means it must involve the free will of all participants.\n\nDigital technology andartificial intelligenceare having a big impact on Islamic banking. The market for software in Islamic banking is expected to grow from $1.33 billion by a rate of 9.3% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nHere's an example to show how Islamic banking works. Since\u00a0interest\u00a0is prohibited, banks do not lend interest-based\u00a0loans. So, if someone wants to make a major purchase, the bank may use themurabahamethod, a cost-financing system. Here's how it works:\n\nSavings accounts\u00a0under Islamic banking principles don't\u00a0pay you interest, unlike mostsavings accounts in the U.S.However, the bank can invest your\u00a0deposits\u00a0in investments compliant with Sharia law, sharing the profits with you.\n\nIslamic banking aims to ensure a fair, transparent, and harmless financial process for all involved.Conventional bankingoften shares the same values, especially among more modern banks, but in some cases it also\u00a0allows\u00a0financial institutions\u00a0to profit while their clients assume a good deal of risk.\n\nIslamic banking adheres to the principles of Sharia law. It treats money as a medium of exchange rather than as a commodity. Islamic banking prohibits\u00a0interest, risk, and speculation, and encourages profit-sharing, fairness, transparency, and ethical investing. Although many Muslims adhere to Islamic finance, non-Muslims can find it appealing as well.\n\nBank of England. \"What Is Islamic Finance?\"\n\nResearch and Markets. \"Islamic Finance Market Report 2024.\"\n\nWorld Finance. \u201cTop Five Growth Markets for Islamic Finance.\"\n\nGlobal Finance. \"Islamic Finance: Just for Muslim-Majority Nations?\"\n\nNylaBank. \"What Is Islamic Banking?
