He received an honorable discharge from the Navy in 1969.\n\nCavanaugh attended the Kidder-Peabody Utility Corporate Finance program in 1983 and Harvard University\u2019s advanced management program in 1991.As a working student, these designations helped prepare him for senior management roles in production within theenergy sector.\n\nAfter leaving the Navy, Cavanaugh began his career at Entergy in New Orleans.

Seven years later, he rose to the role of chairman andchief executive officer (CEO). As the company's leader, he was a key player in the firm'sacquisitionof Florida Progress, which CP&L bought for $54 a share.\n\nThe combined company adopted a new name, Progress Energy, and became what was at the time the ninth-largest energy producer in the United States.
