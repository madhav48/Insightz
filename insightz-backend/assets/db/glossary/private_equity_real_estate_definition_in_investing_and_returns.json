  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nPrivate equity real estate is analternative asset classcomposed of professionally managed pooled private and public investments in thereal estatemarkets. Investing in private equity real estate involves the acquisition, financing, and ownership (either direct or indirect) of property or properties via an investment fund.\n\nPrivate equity real estate should not be confused with an equity real estate investment trust, orequity REIT, which are publicly-traded shares representing real estate investments whose revenues are mainly generated through rental incomes on their real estate holdings.\n\nPrivate equityreal estate funds allowhigh-net-worth individuals(HWNIs)\u00a0and institutions such as\u00a0endowments\u00a0and pension funds to invest in equity and debt holdings related to real estate assets.\n\nUsing anactive management strategy, private equity real estate takes a\u00a0diversified\u00a0approach to property ownership.General partners(GPs) invest in a variety of property types in different locations, which can range\u00a0from new development and raw land holdings to complete redevelopment of existing properties, or cash flow injections into struggling properties.\n\nPrivate equity real estate investments are commonlypooledand can be structured aslimited partnerships(LPs), limited liability companies (LLCs), S-corps, C-corps, collective investment trusts, private REITs, separate insurer accounts, or other legal structures.\n\nInvesting in private equity real estate requires an investor with a long-term outlook and a significant upfrontcapitalcommitment\u2014over $250,000 initially and follow-on investments over time. Little flexibility andliquidityare offered to investors since the capital commitment window typically requires several years.\n\nLock-up periodsfor private equity real estate can sometimes last for more than a dozen or more years. Also, distributions can be slow because they are often paid from cash flow rather than outright liquidation\u2014investors have no right to demand a liquidation. Moreover, fund managers typically charge a2-and-20 fee structure, costing investors 2% of invested assets per year plus 20% of profits.\n\nThe following category of investor invests in private equity real estate:\n\nFunds created for individual investors generally require that the investment be funded at the time of the signing of the investment agreement, whereas funds created forinstitutional investorsrequire a capital commitment. That capital is then drawn down as suitable investments are made. If no investments are made during the investment period specified by the agreement, nothing can be drawn from the commitment.\n\nPrivate equity real estate investing is risky, but it can also provide high returns.\n\nDespite the lack of flexibility and liquidity, this type of investment can provide high potential levels of income with strong priceappreciation. Annual returns in the 6% to 8% range for core strategies and 8% to 10% forcore-plusstrategies are not uncommon.\n\nReturns for value-added or opportunistic strategies can be considerably higher. That said, private equity real estate is risky enough that investors can lose their entire investment if a fund underperforms.\n\nPrivate equity real estate funds became popular in the 1990s amid falling property prices as a way to scoop up properties as values fell. Previously, most institutional real estate investing adhered to core assets.\n\nOffice buildings (high-rise, urban, suburban, and garden offices); industrial properties (warehouse, research and development, flexible offices, or industrial space); retail properties, shopping centers (neighborhood, community, and power centers); and multifamily apartments (garden and high-rise) are the most common private equity real estate investments.\n\nThere are also niche property investments such as senior or student housing, hotels, self-storage, medical offices, single-family housing to own or rent, undeveloped land, manufacturing space, and more.",
