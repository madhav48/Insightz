  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nThe Pac-Man defense is a defensive tactic used by a targeted firm in ahostile takeoversituation. In a Pac-Man defense, the target firm then tries to acquire the company that has made a hostile takeover attempt. In an attempt to scare off the would-be acquirers, the takeover target may use any method to acquire the other company, including dipping into itswar chestfor cash to buy a majority stake in the other company.\n\nIn the actual Pac-Man video game, the player has several ghosts chasing and trying to eliminate it. If the player eats a power pellet, they may turn around and eat the ghosts.\n\nCompanies may use a similar approach as a means of avoiding a hostile takeover by turning the tables on the acquirer and mounting a bid to take over the raider. During the acquiring phase, thetakeovercompany may begin a large-scale purchase of the target company\u2019s stocks to gain control of the company. As a counter-strategy, the target company may begin buying back its shares and purchasing shares of the acquiring company.\n\nIt helps substantially if the targeted company has a war chest so that it has the means to mount a Pac-Man defense. A company\u2019s war chest is the buffer of cash kept aside for uncertain adverse events, such as taking over a company. A war chest is typically invested in liquid assets such as Treasury bills and bank deposits that are available on demand.\n\nA smaller or equivalent company may avoid a hostile takeover by using the Pac-Man defense.\n\nFor some companies, the Pac-Man defense is one of the few options available when faced with a hostile takeover attempt. Without getting aggressive and fighting back, the company may have no chance of surviving. However, on the downside, the Pac-Man defense can be an expensive strategy that may increase debts for the target company. Shareholders may suffer losses or lower dividends in future years.\n\nIn 1982, Bendix Corp. attempted to acquire Martin Marietta by purchasing a controlling amount of its stocks. Bendix became the owner of the company on paper. However, Martin Marietta\u2019s management retaliated by selling off its chemical, cement and aluminum divisions, and borrowing over $1 billion to counter the acquisition. The conflict resulted in Allied Corp. acquiring Bendix.\n\nIn February 1988, after a month-long takeover fight that began when E-II Holdings Inc. made an offer for American Brands Inc., American Brands bought E-II for $2.7 billion. American Brands financed the merger through existing lines of credit and a private placement of commercial paper.\n\nFinally, in October 2013, Jos. A. Bank launched a bid to take over competitor Men\u2019s Wearhouse. Men\u2019s Wearhouse rejected the bid and countered with its own offers. During negotiations, Jos. A. Bank bought Eddie Bauer to gain more control in the marketplace. Men\u2019s Wearhouse ended up buying Jos. A. Bank for $1.8 billion.\n\nBendix. \"History.\" Accessed July 10, 2021.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"The Men's Wearhouse 2014 Form 10-K,\" Page 11. Accessed July 10, 2021.",
