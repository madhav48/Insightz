  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\n\"Long term\" refers to the extended period of time that an asset\u00a0is held. Depending on the type of security, along-termasset can be held for as little as one year or for as long as 30 years or more. Generally speaking, long-term investing for individuals\u00a0is often thought to be in the range of at least seven to 10 years of holding time,\u00a0although there is no absolute rule.\n\n\"Long term\" is one of those phrases that is so ubiquitous in finance that it has become difficult to pin down a specific meaning. The media frequently advises people to \"invest for the long term,\"\u00a0but determining whether or not an investment is long-term is very subjective.\n\nAday trader, for example, would define \"long term\" much differently than a buy-and-hold investor. For the day trader, a position held overnight would be a long-term commitment. For the buy-and-hold investor, anything less than several years may be considered short-term.\n\nA long-term investment is found on the asset side of a company's\u00a0balance sheet,\u00a0representing\u00a0the company's\u00a0investments, including stocks, bonds,real estate,\u00a0and cash, that it intends to hold for more than a year.\n\nWhen a firm purchases shares of\u00a0stock or another company's debt\u00a0as investments, determining\u00a0whether to classify it as short-term or long-term affects the way those assets are valued on the balance sheet.\n\nShort-term investments aremarked-to-market, and any declines in their value are\u00a0recognized as a loss; however, increases in value are not recognized until the item is sold. This means that classifying\u00a0an investment as long-\u00a0or short-term\u00a0has a direct impact on the reported\u00a0net income of the company holding the investment.\n\nAnalysts look for changes in long-term assets as a sign that a company may beliquidatingto cover current expenses; generally, a problem if it continues.\n\nFor many individuals, saving and investing forretirementrepresents their main long-term project. While it is true that there are other expenses that require a multi-year effort, such as buying a car or buying and paying off a house, retirement is the main reason most people have a portfolio. In this case, we are encouraged to start early and invest often.\n\nReal estate is often considered to be a long-term investment. Individuals that buy a house usually sell it many years after they have bought it or they own it until the mortgage is fully paid off.\n\nProfitable securities sold after a year are subject tocapital gains taxas opposed to ordinary income tax for securities sold under a year.\n\nStocks, mutual funds, andexchange-traded funds(ETFs) can either be long-term or short-term investments, depending on how long they are held for.An individual can buy a stock and sell it if it appreciates in a few weeks or months. Conversely, the same stock can be held for years and sold until it has appreciated even more.\n\nUsing both a long-term outlook and the power ofcompounding, individual investors can use the years they have between themselves and retirement to take prudent risks. When your time horizon is measured in decades, market downturns and other risks can be taken for the long-term rewards of a higher overall return.\n\nLong-term investments are any securities that areheld for more than a year, generally. These can include stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nA long-term investment strategy aims to hold an investment security for a year or more. Long-term investment strategies come with a higher amount of risk due to the unpredictability of future outcomes. Furthermore, the goal is price appreciation over a long period, rather than immediately, which means riding out dips in a security's price. Long-term investments should also be part of a diversified portfolio to reduce long-term volatility.\n\nGold has long been considered a good investment to hedge against inflation as well as a store of value; however, data has shown that both stocks and bonds have outperformed gold in the long term, on average.Depending on the specific period, however, gold can outperform stocks and bonds.\n\nMarketable securities can be most investments, including stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Marketable securities are considered current assets and are expected to be sold in less than a year, usually a few months. These types of securities are typically liquid securities that can be sold easily as there is a large number of buyers.\n\nLong-term securities are less liquid because they need to be held for a longer time to realize a profit. In many cases, they are also not easily sold. For example, a house is considered a long-term investment; one that takes time to appreciate and that cannot be sold quickly. Bonds with longer maturities also have higher payouts over time but need to be held longer for a higher yield.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 409, Capital Gains and Losses.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Beginners' Guide to Financial Statements.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Mutual Funds and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) \u2013 A Guide for Investors.\"\n\nAnalyzing Alpha. \"Stocks, Bonds, and Gold Returns from 1922+.\"",
