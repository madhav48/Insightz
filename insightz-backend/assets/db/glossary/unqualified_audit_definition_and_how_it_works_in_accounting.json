  "term": "Unqualified Audit: Definition and How It Works in Accounting",
  "definition": "An unqualified audit is a thorough report that states that a company's internal systems of control and its financial statements are accurate and comply with generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nAn unqualified audit is a complete review that certifies a company's financial statements are compliant withgenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Also called a clean opinion or an unqualified report, an unqualified audit is given after the auditor completes thorough research of all of the accompanying financial documents. It also analyzes the internal systems of control as well as the details in the organization's books. Unqualified audits give companies credibility, show that they meet regulatory requirements, and help them access capital.\n\nThe alternative to an unqualified audit is anunaudited opinion. Unqualified audits are performed with emphasis on details and accuracy and according to accepted accounting principles. If an auditor has reservations as to the accuracy or validity of a firm's financial statements, a qualified opinion may be given instead that outlines the auditor's reservations.\n\nAn unqualified report concludes that the financial statements of a company are fair and transparent based on thorough research.\n\nIn an unqualified report, auditors will conclude that thefinancial statementsof a business present its affairs fairly in all material aspects. This opinion assumes that a business complied with GAAP and statutory requirements. An opinion of this sort is known as a clean report.\n\nThe unqualified report also reflects that any changes in accounting policies have been considered in the financial statements. This opinion does not offer a view on whether a business is in good economic health. The opinion rather states that a business's financial reporting is transparent and thorough and has not hidden important facts.\n\nA qualified report does not comment on whether a business is in good economic health, only that a business's financial reporting is transparent and thorough.\n\nFor an unqualified report, the auditor has concluded that most financial matters are dealt with correctly\u2014although there may be some outstanding minor issues. In contrast, anauditor\u2019s reportis qualified for reasons such as limited scope in the auditor\u2019s work or if there are issues concerning the accounting policies. The points of concern must be financially significant for an auditor to qualify a report.\n\nFor example, the auditor might consider that an issue misrepresents the actual financial position of the firm. In this case, the auditor might issue a disclaimer or adverse opinion.\n\nHowever, a qualified audit report does not necessarily mean that a business is in distress or that a firm is failing to disclose important information in the financial statements. A qualified audit report only reflects the auditor\u2019s inability to give a clean report.",
