  "term": "What Is Window Dressing in Finance?",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nWindow dressing is the term for a strategy used by retailers\u2014dressing up a window display\u2014to draw in customers. The financial industry adopted it to refer to the practice of altering financial data to appear more attractive to investors.\n\nBusinesses can time adjustments in their accounting procedures, and investment holdings can be changed at specific times to seem as if they are more profitable, have higher returns, or have been performing well the entire period.\n\nSpecific to investments, it is used to refer to how a fund or portfolio manager might buy or sell securities at a particular time to appear to be performing better.\n\nWindow dressing is adeceptive practiceno matter what industry it is used in or what purpose it serves. It paints a false financial picture because information is changed to make a company seem to perform better than it did.\n\nMutual funds are companies that purchase stocks and sell portions of those stocks to investors. Fund managers might replace nonperforming stocks near the end of a reporting period to make it seem as if a fund is performing better than it is.\n\nCompanies can alter reportable financial information through their accounting procedures. This changes the data that is reported on their quarterly and annual reports or letters to shareholders.\n\nIt is illegal for businesses to alter their accounting practices to change how their reports look. But unless there is a clear violation of securities laws or if the fund alters its accounting methods to window dress, investment managers are not doing anything illegal by replacing a fund\u2019s holdings at specific times. That said, it is an unethical practice because it attempts to deceive investors and regulators.\n\nFund and portfolio managers get paid to ensure investing instruments are performing. If they don\u2019t perform, investors may become interested in other products or services that appear to be offering better returns. To prevent this from happening, managers might replace holdings near the end of the reporting period to keep investors from moving money to other investments.\n\nA hedge fund manager might sell stocks that have experienced significant losses and purchase high-flying stocks near the end of the quarter or year. These securities are then reported as part of the fund\u2019s holdings, making it seem like they had been there the entire time.\n\nWhen performance has been lagging, fund managers may sell stocks that have reported substantial losses and replace them with stocks expected to produceshort-term gainsto improve the fund\u2019s overall performance for the reporting period.\n\nInvestors should pay close attention to holdings that appear outside of a fund\u2019s strategy and the assets that have been replaced.\n\nFor example, imagine that a fund investing in stocks exclusively from theS&P 500has underperformed the index. Stocks A and B outperformed the total index but wereunderweightin the fund, while stocks C and D were overweight in the fund but lagged the index.\n\nTo make it look like the fund was investing in stocks A and B all along, the portfolio manager could sell out of stocks C and D, replacing them with A and B. This would also give anoverweightto stocks A and B.\n\nAnother way is for a manager to purchase stocks that do not meet the style or strategy of the mutual fund. For example, aprecious metalsfund might invest in stocks that were performing well and disguise them. This gives the fund the appearance of a short-term performance boost that is not aligned with the market or indexes it might mirror.\n\nThough disclosure rules are intended to aid in increasing transparency for investors, window dressing can still obscure the practices of the fund manager. There are some techniques you can use to identify window dressing:\n\nFirst, ensure holdings match the index that the fund tracks if it is an index fund. If it isn\u2019t an index fund, make sure they meet the fund\u2019s published intent. Most funds have a description of what they are designed to invest in, usually called the fund\u2019s objective. For example, the Fidelity Value Fund\u2019s (FDVLX) objective is to seek capital appreciation, using a strategy of valuating companies with valuable fixed assets and purchasing the stocks of the ones it believes are undervalued.\n\nIf you found holdings in this fund you believed didn\u2019t fit the objective and strategy, it might be window dressing. But then, it might not because the fund\u2019s valuation methodology might allow it to change holdings.\n\nSecond, look over the fund\u2019s holdings and compare the returns of each one. For instance, FDVLX had more than 200 holdings on Jan. 31, 2023, with the top 10 stocks making up slightly more than 10% of the fund. If you look at the fund\u2019s monthly holding report, you can find each stock\u2019s ticker and evaluate it. By comparing holdings from month to month, you might also see them changing and be able to investigate performance differences between the old and new ones.\n\nThird, use these reports to identify past and current turnover and determine when it occurs. There might be a pattern of turnover, such as a majority of stocks remaining in the fund\u2019s holdings with several nonperformers turning over at intervals that don\u2019t make sense. This could be regular fund management, but it pays to take a look.\n\nFinally, look at the fund\u2019s management. Fund managers lacking trading acumen or who have experienced poor performance in the past are more likely to window dress. Good funds have experienced, ethical managers who do not need to window dress.\n\nPublicly owned companies must follow specific accounting guidelines that ensure investors and regulators have a transparent view of financial performance. Some hire accounting firms to ensure their books are kept up to date and that reports are generated.\n\nThere is always the chance that management or leadership will not like the results seen on these financial reports, so they may try to make changes to accounts or accounting methods to make it look like they performed better than they did.\n\nThe most significant reason a business would window-dress its financial reports is to ensure they don\u2019t lose investor interest. Investors and lenders make up a large portion of a company\u2019s fundraising efforts. Lenders use these reports to make lending decisions, and investors use them for investing decisions. Therefore, lower financial performance can mean less funding.\n\nNot all accounting window dressing is as evident as changing some numbers. Here are a few examples of changes in accounting methods:\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand that many businesses are honest and trying to do the right thing. Looking out for window dressing should be part of your tool kit when you\u2019re evaluating investment opportunities, just in case you come across a company that is trying to cook the books or deceive you.\n\nWhile difficult to determine, you can identify window dressing by studying past financial reports and reading about a company\u2019s activities via their news releases and investor reports. You may be able to identify discrepancies between them. For instance, examine the cash flow statement to see where cash is coming from and where it is going, then compare it to cash flows from the last few periods.\n\nIf there are significant changes, you should be able to find a summary in the investor or financial reports with a description of why it has changed. If you don\u2019t see it, you may want to investigate further.\n\nLook for a change in accounting procedures\u2014a company should publish that they began accounting differently for something recently (in fact, publicly traded companies are required to report accounting procedure changes). Look for increases in valuation, a dramatic increase in sales that doesn\u2019t correspond to past seasonal or cyclical sales, or another issue that might raise an eyebrow.\n\nYou may have heard that a stock is window dressing for a fund or that a business\u2019s reports are window dressed. This means that a stock has been replaced close to the end of a reporting period to boost performance falsely, or the reports are altered to be more financially attractive to investors and lenders.\n\nWindow dressing in accounting is unethical and illegal. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has fined companies for window dressing.\n\nFinancial statements are an aggregation of the results of the accounting process for an accounting period. There are several ways to window dress these statements. Some examples are recording certain expenses differently or capitalizing expenses rather than accounting for them as expenses.\n\nWindow dressing is used by some investment managers, financial departments, or executives to give the appearance that a particular investment or business is doing better than it is. It is an illegal practice regarding accounting procedures and financial reporting.\n\nBut when investment managers window dress by replacing holdings at the end of a period to make an investment instrument appear to perform better, it\u2019s more of a violation of ethical fund management practices. It is an attempt to fool you into investing in something you might not invest in otherwise. That\u2019s why it\u2019s essential to know what it is and how to identify it.\n\nFidelity. \u201cFDVLX: Fidelity\u00ae Value Fund.\u201d\n\nFidelity. \u201cPortfolio Holdings Listing Fidelity Value Fund.\u201d Scroll down to Prospectus, Reports, & Related Literature.
