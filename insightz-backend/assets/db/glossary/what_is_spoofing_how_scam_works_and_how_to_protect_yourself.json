  "term": "What Is Spoofing? How Scam Works and How To Protect Yourself",
  "definition": "Spoofing is a type of scam in which a criminal disguises an email address, display name, phone number, text message, or website URL to convince a target that they are interacting with a known, trusted source. Spoofing often involves changing just one letter, number, or symbol of the communication so that it looks valid at a quick glance. For example, you could receive an email that appears to be from Netflix using the fake domain name \u201cnetffix.com.\u201d\n\nSpoofing criminals try to gain your trust, and they count on making you believe that the spoofed communications are legitimate. Often, using the name of a big, trusted company\u2014such as Amazon or PayPal\u2014is enough toget targets to take some kind of actionor reveal information.\n\nFor instance, a fake email from Amazon might indicate a problem with a recent purchase, which could motivate you to click on the link to learn more (hint: Don\u2019t click on the link). From that link, you could download malware or be directed to a fake login page, where you unknowingly enter your username and password.\n\nSpoofing can lead you to disclose personal and financial information, send money, and download malware, which can lead to infected computers, financial fraud, andidentity theft. Spoofing can be used to spread malware via links and attachments, bypass network access controls, and restrict access throughdenial-of-service (DoS) attacks. At the corporate level, spoofing can cause infected computer systems and networks, data breaches, and loss of income.\n\nThere are several kinds of spoofing, including email spoofing, text message spoofing, caller ID spoofing, and URL and GPS\u00a0spoofing. Essentially, if there\u2019s a form of online communication, spoofers are trying to scam their way into it\u2014and into your identity and your assets.\n\nThere are several ways to protect yourself from would-be spoofing scammers:\n\nIf you think you\u2019ve been spoofed, you can file a complaint at the Consumer Complaint Center of theFederal Communications Commission(FCC).The FCC doesn\u2019t act on individual complaints but will add that information to its database. If you\u2019ve lost money because of spoofing, the FCC recommends contacting your local police department.\n\nEmail spoofing is the act of sending emails with false sender addresses, typically as part of aphishingattack intended to steal your data, ask for money, or infect your computer with malware. This tactic is used by both dishonest advertisers and outright thieves. The spoofer sends emails with a falsified \u201cFrom:\u201d line to trick victims into believing that the message is from a friend, their bank, or some other legitimate source. Any email that asks for your password, Social Security number, or any other personal information could be a trick.\n\nThese emails typically include a combination of deceptive features, including:\n\nSometimes referred to as smishing, text message (SMS) spoofing is similar to email spoofing. The text message appears to come from a legitimate source, such as your bank or a doctor\u2019s office. It may request that you call a specific phone number or click on a link within the message to get you to divulge personal information.\n\nHere, the spoofer falsifies the phone number from which they are calling in the hope of getting you to take their call. On your caller ID, it might appear that the call is coming from a legitimate business or government agency, such as theInternal Revenue Service(IRS). Note that the IRS says it doesn\u2019t call taxpayers to tell them they owe taxes without first sending them a bill in the mail.\n\nSpoofing comes in many forms, but the goal is usually to trick people into divulging personal information that criminals can use.\n\nThis is a type of caller ID spoofing in which the call appears to be from someone you know or a person who lives near you. The FCC says that the Truth in Caller ID Act prohibits \u201canyone from transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud, cause harm or wrongly obtain anything of value.\u201d If they\u2019re caught (and that\u2019s a big \u201cif\u201d), the spoofer can face penalties of up to $10,000 for each violation.\n\nURL spoofing happens when scammers set up a fraudulent website to obtain information from victims or install malware on their computers. For instance, victims might be directed to a site that looks like it belongs to their bank or credit card company and be asked to log in using their user ID and password. If the person falls for it and logs in, the scammer could then use the information that the victim typed in to log into the real site and access their accounts.\n\nGPS spoofing has a somewhat different purpose. It attempts to trick a GPS receiver into believing it is in a different location or headed in a different direction by broadcasting bogus GPS signals or other means. At this point, GPS spoofing is more likely to be used in warfare or by gamers (e.g., Pok\u00e9mon GO players) than to target individual consumers, although the technology exists to make anyone vulnerable.\n\nThese spoofing attacks involve three players: the victim, the entity that the victim is trying to communicate with, and the \u201cman in the middle\u201d who intercepts the communications. The spoofer attempts to eavesdrop on the exchange or impersonate one of the parties. The goal is to intercept information that is useful, sensitive, or potentially profitable (e.g., login credentials and credit card information).Stolen information can be usedto approve financial transactions, for identity theft, or it may be sold to a third party.\n\nThis type of scam happens when someone wants to disguise or hide the location from where they\u2019re sending or requesting data, so they replace the sourceInternet protocol (IP) addresswith a fake one. The spoofed IP address looks like it\u2019s from a trusted source (the original IP address) while masking its true identity: an unknown third party.Virtual private network (VPN) services allow users to mask their IP and location, which can also be used for legitimate reasons such as privacy or streaming content went traveling overseas.\n\nThis is the latest form of spoofing. With facial spoofing, a criminal uses a person\u2019s face and simulates their facial biometrics by using a photo or video to replace their identity. Facial spoofing is most commonly used to commit bank identity fraud. However, it is also used in money laundering.\n\nSpoofing involves faking one's identity, and can be used for various attacks such as identity theft.\n\nPhishingis one such use of spoofing that attempts to steal somebody's personal information or credentials by having them volunteer that information from a nefarious source that looks legit. For instance, a phishing email may appear to come from your bank, but the link inside would direct you to a phony version of the bank's website. If you enter your credentials, they are subsequently turned over to the attacker.\n\nSpoofing can be sophisticated, so the key is to pay close attention to the details and trust your instincts. Be wary of websites with no lock symbols or green bars, or URLs that begin with HTTP instead of HTTPS, the encrypted version of HTTP. Another way to tell a fake website is if your password manager doesn\u2019t autofill your login\u2014a sign that it doesn\u2019t recognize the website.\n\nWith emails, take a close look at the sender\u2019s address, keeping in mind that scammers will use fake domains that are very similar to legitimate ones. Of course, typos, bad grammar, and unusual syntax in the email are also red flags. If you\u2019re still unsure, copy and paste the contents of the email into Google, where a quick search can reveal if a known scam is circulating. Finally, always hover over an embedded link to reveal the URL before you click on it. If the URL looks suspicious, it is likely a scam.Expand the details of the sender to see if the email address is correct and not just the name. Also pay attention for alternations in small details like a capital \"i\" (I) for a small \"L\" (l).\n\nWith phones, caller ID is easily spoofed. Scammers often use neighbor spoofing, so it appears that calls are coming from a local number. They may also spoof a number from a government agency or business that you know and trust. The FCC advises people not to answer calls from unknown numbers\u2014and to hang up immediately if you do answer such a call.\n\nTo hover on a link that\u2019s on your smartphone, hold your finger on the link for a few seconds. A window will pop up that shows the full URL of the link. This can help you determine if the link is reliable or suspicious.\n\nSpoofing can be illegal depending on the type of spoof, the intent, and the jurisdiction involved. If you mask your phone number but there is no harm, spoofing is legal. But in the U.S., the FCC prohibits anyone from transmitting misleading or inaccurate caller ID information with the intent to defraud,\u00a0with fines up to $10,000 per instance.\n\nA common spoofing scenario happens when an email is sent from a fake sender address, asking the recipient to provide sensitive data. Typically, the recipient is prompted to click on a link to log into their account and update personal and financial details. Links in spoofing emails also infect the recipient\u2019s computer with malware.\n\nThe terms \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d are often used interchangeably, but they mean different things. Spoofing uses a fake email address, display name, phone number, or web address to trick people into believing that they are interacting with a known, trusted source. Phishing tricks you into providing personal data that can be used for identity theft. Many phishers use spoofing tactics to trick their victims into believing they are providing personal information to a legitimate, trusted source.\n\nPeople have pretended to be other people or therepresentatives of other organizationssince time immemorial. However, with the advent of the internet and online communications, \"spoofing\" has become much easier and more widespread. Websites, emails, geolocations, and phone numbers today can all be spoofed by bad actors to commit crimes, steal identities, or perpetuate scams. Knowing how to spot and protect against spoofing is important in the digital age. At the same time, spoofing can provide anonymity for internet users for legitimate purposes of privacy. The use of VPNs, for instance, can mask your location and identity when surfing the web.\n\nConsumer Complaint Center-Federal Communications Commission. \"Home.\"\n\nAvast. \u201cWhat Is Spoofing and How Can You Prevent It?\u201d\n\nMalwarebytes. \u201cWhat Is a Spoofing Attack?\u201d\n\nFederal Communications Commission. \u201cConsumer Guide: Caller ID Spoofing.\u201d\n\nNorton. \u201cIP Spoofing: What Is It and How Does It Work?\u201d\n\nFederal Communications Commission. \u201cCaller ID Spoofing.\u201d\n\nRochester Institute of Technology. \u201c\u2018Hovering\u2019 Before You Click.\u201d",
