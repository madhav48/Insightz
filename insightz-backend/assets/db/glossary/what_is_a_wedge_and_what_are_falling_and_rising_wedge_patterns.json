  "term": "What Is a Wedge and What Are Falling and Rising Wedge Patterns?",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA wedge is a price pattern marked by converging trend lines on a price chart. The two trend lines are drawn to connect the respective highs and lows of a price series over the course of 10 to 50 periods. The lines show that the highs and the lows are either rising or falling at differing rates, giving the appearance of a wedge as the lines approach a convergence. Technical analysts consider wedge-shaped trend lines useful indicators of a potential reversal in price action.\n\nA wedge pattern can signal either bullish or bearish pricereversals. In either case, this pattern holds three common characteristics: first, the converging trend lines; second, a pattern of declining volume as the price progresses through the pattern; third, a breakout from one of the trend lines. The two forms of the wedge pattern are a rising wedge (which signals a bearish reversal) and a falling wedge (which signals a bullish reversal).\n\nThis usually occurs when a security\u2019s price has been rising over time, but it can also occur in the midst of a downward trend as well.\n\nThetrend linesdrawn above and below the price chart pattern can converge to help a trader or analyst anticipate a breakout reversal. While price can be out of either trend line, wedge patterns have a tendency to break in the opposite direction from the trend lines.\n\nTherefore, rising wedge patterns indicate the more likely potential of falling prices after a breakout of the lower trend line. Traders can make bearish trades after the breakout by selling the security short or usingderivativessuch as futures or options, depending on the security being charted. These trades seek to profit from the potential for prices to fall.\n\nWhen a security's price has been falling over time, a wedge pattern can occur just as the trend makes its final downward move. The trend lines drawn above the highs and below the lows on the price chart pattern can converge as the price slide losesmomentumand buyers step in to slow the rate of decline. Before the lines converge, the price may breakout above the upper trend line.\n\nWhen the price breaks the upper trend line, the security is expected to reverse and trend higher. Traders identifying bullish reversal signals would want to look for trades that benefit from the security\u2019s rise in price.\n\nAs a general rule, price pattern strategies for trading systems rarely yield returns that outperform buy-and-hold strategies over time, but some patterns do appear to be useful in forecasting general price trends nonetheless.\n\nBecause wedge patterns converge to a smaller price channel, the distance between the price on entry of the trade and the price for a stop loss is relatively smaller than the start of the pattern. This means that a stop loss can be placed close by at the time the trade begins, and if the trade is successful, the outcome can yield a greater return than the amount risked on the trade to begin with.\n\nA wedge pattern can be either a continuation or a reversal. Which one it is will depend on the breakout direction of the wedge. For example, a rising wedge that occurs after an uptrend typically results in a reversal. A rising wedge that occurs in a downtrend will usually signify that the downtrend will continue, hence being a continuation.\n\nA falling wedge pattern is seen as a bullish signal as it reflects that a sliding price is starting to lose momentum and that buyers are starting to move in to slow down the fall.\n\nUsually, a rising wedge pattern is bearish, indicating that a stock that has been on the rise is on the verge of having a breakout reversal, and therefore likely to slide.\n\nTraders usingtechnical analysisrely on chart patterns to help make trading decisions, particularly to help decide on entry and exit points. There are many patterns that technical traders employ, the wedge pattern being one of them. This pattern employs two trend lines that connect the highs and lows of a price series, indicating either a reversal or continuation of the trend.",
