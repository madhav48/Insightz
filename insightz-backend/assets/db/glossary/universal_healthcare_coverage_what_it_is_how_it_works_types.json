  "term": "Universal Healthcare Coverage: What it is, How it Works, Types",
  "definition": "Universal healthcare coverage refers to systems in which all residents of a particular geographical area or country have health insurance. An early example of universal healthcare coverage is Germany in the 1880s, when Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced a series of bills guaranteeing access to healthcare.Today, most industrialized nations\u2014including France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, but not the United States\u2014provide universal healthcare coverage for their citizens.\n\nAlthough the U.S. leads industrialized nations in healthcare spending, it has worse health outcomes and a smaller percentage of the population is served. Now, the healthcare system is struggling even more under the double burden of the global pandemic and the loss of income from elective surgery and routine medical care that was suspended during the crisis.\n\nOne answer to the this crisis, according to everyone from\u00a0New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio to the World Health Organization and Pope Francis, is to provide Americans with universal healthcare coverage.\n\nThere are at least three types of systems that can potentially ensure that everyone in a jurisdiction is covered for medical and hospital care. These include requiring or mandating health insurance, providing insurance (but not care) via a single government payer, and socialized medicine, in which both insurance and medical care are managed by the government.\n\nSome governments mandate that all residents buy a health insurance policy or face a fine or penalty. The government may subsidize part of the premiums but most insurance is provided by private companies. Germany\u2019s system, for example, includes both for-profit and not-for-profit insurers. Requiring health insurance has helped some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, achieve universal coverage.\n\nIn the U.S., the 2010Affordable Care Actestablished a similar requirement and system. The law\u2019s original \u201cindividual mandate\u201d levied a tax penalty on people who did not purchase health insurance. TheTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)repealed the penalty, starting in 2019.\n\nSome U.S. states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont) and the District of Columbia levy their own penalties on those who do not buy health insurance.Since 2006, Massachusetts, for example, has required its residents to have health insurance or pay a fine.This has helped encourage insurance rates as high as 95.4% in the state.\n\nUnder a single-payer\u00a0system, all health costs are paid by the government using tax revenue. This allows countries to control costs, in part, by having the government play a stronger role in negotiating prices for healthcare. Health insurance is universal and offered by a single entity.However, medical care itself is provided by private-sector doctors and hospitals.\n\nExamples of this model include Canada and France. In both of these countries, private-sector insurers also exist, but they play a minor role as providers of supplemental coverage.\n\nIn these systems, both insurance and medical care are provided by the government.\n\nIn the United Kingdom's National Health Service, for example, the government owns most of the hospitals and employs medical providers. Sweden's publicly funded system mostly provides care through government providers, though private companies play a limited role. Socialized systems are less common than single-payer ones.\n\nThe global pandemic has increased pressure on America's very complex and expensive healthcare system, making it more urgent to lower costs and perhaps provide universal healthcare.\n\nIn the U.S., the ACA increased the number of insured people, but has not achieved universal healthcare coverage.The U.S. Department of Health reported the percentage of U.S. adults without health insurance stood at 8% in 2022.The other 92% of people have health insurance through a mix of government and private insurance providers.\n\nIn the world of employer-based insurance, large companies often use a mix of private and self-insurance to cover a percentage of their employees' health costs.\n\nAlso, since 2011, the federal government has provided incentives for private insurers to compete against government programs such as Medicare by providing lower costs and more benefits to enrollees. Some of the best Medicare Advantage plans are excellent examples.Recipients of Medicaid choose a private insurance plan for which state and federal governments pay much of the costs.\n\nThis mix of approaches may encourage competition and entrepreneurial opportunities, and offer consumers choice and incentives to try to keep healthcare costs down. Butit results in a very expensive healthcare systemthat falls short in delivering universal care and on many measures of public health.\n\nThese issues are likely to be pivotal ones in the party platforms and 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTulchinsky, Theodore H. \"Bismarck and the Long Road to Universal Health Coverage.\"Case Studies in Public Health, 2018, pp. 131\u2013179.\n\nNew York State, Department of Health. \"Foreign Countries With Universal Health Care.\"\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"Pandemic Disrupts Some Trends in Health Care Services.\"\n\nAmerican Hospital Association. \"Financial Effects of COVID-19: Hospital Outlook for the Remainder of 2021.\"\n\nCity of New York. \"Mayor de Blasio Unveils NYC Care Card.\"\n\nWorld Health Organization. \"Universal Health Coverage.\"\n\nCrux. \"Vatican Underlines Support of Universal Health Care Coverage.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund. \"International Health Care System Profiles: Netherlands.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund. \"International Health Care System Profiles: Switzerland.\"\n\nThe Commonwealth Fund. \"International Health Care System Profiles: Germany.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Health & Human Services. \"What is the Affordable Care Act?\"\n\nGlied, Sherry. \"Implications of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act for Public Health.\"American Journal of Public Health, vol. 108, no. 6, June 2018, pp. 734-736.\n\nHealthSherpa. \"Which States Will Charge You a Penalty If You Don\u2019t Have Health Insurance?\"\n\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation, Division of Insurance. \"RE: Definition of \u201cEmployer\u201d Under Section 3(5) of ERISA \u2013 Association Health Plans (RIN 1210-AB85) \u2013 Commonwealth of Massachusetts Comments,\" Pages 1-2.\n\nCenter for Health Information and Analysis. \"Findings from the 2021 Massachusetts Health Insurance Survey: July 2022,\" Page 19.\n\nLiu, Jodi L. and Brook, Robert H. \"What is Single-Payer Health Care?
