  "term": "What Is a Direct Quote?",
  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA direct quote\u00a0is a foreign exchange rate quoted in fixed units of foreign currency in variable amounts of the domestic currency. A direct currency quote asks what amount of domestic currency is needed to buy one unit of foreign currency\u2014most commonly the U.S. dollar (USD) in forex markets. In a direct quote, the foreign currency is thebase currency, while the domestic currency is the\u00a0counter currency or quote currency. This can be contrasted with anindirect quotein which the price of the domestic currency is expressed in terms of a foreign currency.\n\nThe use of direct quotes versus indirect quotes depends on the location of thetraderasking for the quote, as that determines which currency in thepairis domestic and which is foreign. Non-business publications and other media usually quote foreign exchange rates in direct terms for the ease of consumers. However, the foreign exchange market has quoting conventions that transcend local borders.\n\nA direct quote can be compared to an indirect quote as its inverse, or by the following expression:\n\nIn a direct quote, a higherexchange rateimplies that the domestic currency is depreciating or becoming weaker since the price of the foreign currency is effectively rising\u2014and vice versa. Thus, if theUSD/JPY(direct) quotation changes from 100 to 105, it indicates the yen is weakening against the dollar because it would take 5 more yen (the local currency) to buy 1 USD (the foreign currency).\n\nThe U.S. dollar (USD) is the most actively traded currency in the world. In the context of trading rooms and professional publications, most currencies are quoted as the number of foreign currency units per dollar. This means that the dollar serves as the base currency, whether the speaker is in the United States or elsewhere. An example of a direct quote using U.S. dollars might be stating $1.17 Canadian per U.S. dollar, rather than 85.5 U.S. cents per Canadian dollar, which would be the indirect quote.\n\nA major exception to the dollar-base quote rule is when the British pound (GBP) is quoted against other currencies, including the dollar, but with the exception of the euro. This reflects the fact that the pound was the world's dominant currency in the years leading up to World War II and before the ascendancy of the U.S. economy. The exchange rate for the pound would thus be quoted as $1.45 per \u00a31, regardless of whether this is considered direct (in the United States) or indirect (in the United Kingdom).\n\nTheeuro(EUR) came into existence on Jan. 1, 1999 as the unit of account for participatingEuropean Union(EU) member nations; notes and coins were first issued on Jan. 1, 2002. The euro replaced many major traded European currencies, including the German mark, the French franc, and the Dutch guilder.\n\nTheEuropean Central Bank(ECB), which oversaw the conversion, intended the currency to be the financial market's dominant currency. It specified that the euro should always be the base currency whenever it is traded, including against both the U.S. dollar and the British pound. For this reason, quotes are always the number of dollars, pounds, Swiss francs, or Japanese yen needed to buy \u20ac1.\n\nDirect quotes may change often; understand that the prevailing direct quote rate may not be same even across a single day.\n\nWhy would someone use a direct quote over an indirect quote? The choice between using a direct quote or an indirect quote often hinges on clarity, convenience, and the specific needs of the parties involved. A direct quote is commonly used in countries where the domestic currency is stronger or more stable. For instance, if you\u2019re in the United States and dealing with euros, a direct quote might be expressed as $1.10/\u20ac, meaning it takes $1.10 to buy one euro.\n\nThis format is particularly useful for individuals orinternational businessesin the U.S. as it provides a straightforward way to understand the cost of acquiring foreign currency in terms of their own currency. For other countries, a direct quote of \u20ac0.90/$1.00 may cater better to that specific region.\n\nAnother reason to use a direct quote is its alignment with the way most financial markets present exchange rates. In international finance, direct quotes are commonly used for currency pairs involving major currencies like the USD, GBP, and EUR. This standardization simplifies transactions and financial reporting. This aligns itself to what was mentioned above: the stronger currency is usually the primary currency when looking at exchange rates.\n\nFinally, the choice between direct and indirect quotes can also be influenced by the audience's familiarity with the currency pair. For instance, in the forex market, direct quotes are prevalent for currencies where the U.S. dollar is the base currency. This convention supports better transparency and efficiency in trading and investment decisions as that is the standardized format of reporting.\n\nIn addition to direct quotes (and indirect quotes), there are several other ways to get exchange rates. These alternatives include:\n\nA direct quote in foreign currency is a way of expressing the exchange rate by stating the amount of domestic currency needed to purchase one unit of foreign currency. For instance, in the United States, a direct quote for the Euro might be $1.10/\u20ac, meaning $1.10 is required to buy one Euro.\n\nThe primary difference between a direct quote and an indirect quote lies in their perspectives. A direct quote expresses the amount of domestic currency needed to buy one unit of foreign currency, while an indirect quote shows how much foreign currency can be bought with one unit of domestic currency.\n\nDirect quotes are used in currency exchange because they simplify understanding and transactions for individuals and businesses in the domestic currency. By showing the amount of domestic currency needed to buy foreign currency, direct quotes make it easier for users to understand the rate of exchange.\n\nTo convert a direct quote into an indirect quote, you take the reciprocal of the direct quote. For example, if the direct quote is $1.10/\u20ac, the indirect quote is calculated by dividing 1 by 1.10, which gives approximately \u20ac0.91/$1.00.\n\nA direct quote in currency exchange shows the amount of domestic currency needed to purchase one unit of foreign currency. This method is widely used in financial markets for its simplicity and is particularly helpful for countries with stable or strong currencies, providing clarity in international transactions.",
