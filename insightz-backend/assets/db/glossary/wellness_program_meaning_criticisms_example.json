  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe term wellness program refers to an organizational approach to improving individual health. Wellness programs are commonly offered by companies to their employees, providing financial incentives or other resources to stay healthy.\n\nLocal and state governments andinsurancecompanies may also offer incentive-based wellness programs aimed at promoting the health of the public, their employees, or insured individuals. Some of the main offerings of wellness programs include company-sponsored exercise and tobacco cessation programs.\n\nEmployers are taking a very serious approach to the health and wellbeing of their employees. As such, wellness programs have become a very important part of the corporate world. These are initiatives that are designed to promote healthy living andwork/life balancefor employees. Insurance companies and governments may also offer wellness programs for individuals.\n\nWhen individuals are healthy, it improves productivity, decreases sick days and leaves of absences, lowers an organization'shealth insuranceexpenses, reduces turnover, and lowers the chances ofworkers' compensationclaims. Employees can also benefit from wellness programs through lower health insurance premiums, decreased out-of-pocket medical expenditures, and an increased sense of wellbeing.\n\nThere are many ways that wellness programs can help individuals make healthy choices to improve their lifestyles. Companies can offer in-house workout spaces or marked walking paths on thecorporate campusto encourage physical activity. Some corporations may even offer financial incentives, such as lower healthinsurance premiumsorgift cardsfor meeting fitness goals. Offerings may include:\n\nRegardless of how they may be advertised by those who offer them, many people choose not to participate in wellness programs. Some of the main reasons may include a lack of time and commitment and a general lack of knowledge on how to claim wellness-related benefits. Some people may feel uncomfortable about how health screenings and personal information will be used.\n\nCorporate wellness programs should aim to promote\u00a0the mindfulness of workplace noise and\u00a0allow individuals to take regular breaks.\n\nOrganizations may create wellness-related linkages between\u00a0their programs\u00a0and other companybenefitssuch as employee assistance programs (EAPs). These programs\u00a0provide support for\u00a0employees when they find themselves in difficult emotional or physical situations that affect both their health and work.\n\nEAPs connect employees to counselors, who can advise them confidentially on issues ranging from emotional distress, a difficult medical diagnosis, and personal or work-related issues to life events such as marriage or parenting.\n\nAlthough they are designed to give individuals a leg up on their health by improving wellbeing and reducingoperating costs, there is some criticism of wellness programs. One common criticism of these programs is that they only cater to individuals who are already healthy and that they don't necessarily appeal to those who may have emotional and/or physical issues.\n\nSome critics argue that health screenings are\u00a0controversial components\u00a0of many company\u00a0wellness programs. Corporate wellness programs can lead to unnecessary over-testing That's because some\u00a0people contend that\u00a0tracking cholesterol, body mass index,\u00a0and other figures leads to\u00a0de facto discrimination and\u00a0heavier financial burdens placed on workers with below-average\u00a0health.\n\nThe motivations for employer- and insurance company-sponsored wellness programs are heavily debated. Although these programs may be designed to improve individual health, corporations may adopt certain initiatives that may not actually contribute to people's wellbeing. Instead, they may be developed to simply boost a company's bottom line.\n\nCompanies spend anywhere from $150 to $1,200 per employee on wellness programs, depending on the size of the company and the number of individuals employed. According to theInternal Revenue Service(IRS), any \"employer-provided cash rewards,\" such assubsidiesfor gym memberships count astaxable incomesince they are not considered medical care.\n\nThat being said, many studies have been done on thereturn on investment(ROI) of wellness programs. For example, a Towers Watson and the National Business Group on Health study found that companies with highly effective wellness programs had a significantly lowerturnoverrate than companies with ineffective programs, with 9% voluntary attrition compared to 15% without. Research published in theHarvard Business Reviewshows that ROI on effective employee wellness programs can be as high as six to one.\n\nCorporate\u00a0wellness programs\u00a0offer a variety of scheduled programs, including\u00a0stress management seminars that cover topics such as sleep to work-life balance, cooking classes, healthy recipe exchanges,financial well-being, and\u00a0fitness challenges. Other components of an effective corporate wellness program may include healthy options at vending machines and cafeterias. Healthy food may also be\u00a0served at meetings and\u00a0included in company-provided overtime meals.\n\nResearch published in theHarvard Business Reviewshows that the return on investment for effective employee wellness programs can be as high as six to one.\n\nMany employees don't participate in wellness programs due to lack of time, lack of knowledge on how to claim these benefits, or sensitivities around certain types of wellness programs, such as health screenings that may compromise their personal information.\n\nCompanies looking to start a wellness program should poll their employees on the perks they find most beneficial. While a younger company base may prefer wellness programs such as subsidized gym memberships, more established corporations may prefer health screenings or mental health benefits such as access to free therapy, counseling sessions, or otherwise.\n\nCorporate\u00a0wellness programs can offer their employees a huge benefit in managing their work and personal life balance. From cooking classes to gym memberships, health screenings, massage therapists on-campus, and subsidized counseling sessions, wellness programs come in all shapes and sizes. Ultimately, serious investment in these benefits is ultimately about understanding the employees' expectations. If done well, the return on investment in health care savings and lowering attrition can be significant.\n\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). \"Employee Assistance Program (EAP).\"\n\nNPR \"Overtesting Of Employees Can Be A Side Effect Of Workplace Wellness.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Treatment of Wellness Program Benefits and Employer Reimbursement of Premiums Provided Pre-tax Under a Section 125 Cafeteria Plan,\" Page 2.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"What\u2019s the Hard Return on Employee Wellness Programs?\"\n\nDraper Blog. \"Seven Companies With Amazingly Unique Wellness Programs.\"\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin System. \"Well Wisconsin Program.\"",
