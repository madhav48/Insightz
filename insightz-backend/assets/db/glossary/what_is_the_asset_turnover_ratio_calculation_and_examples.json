  "definition": "The asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company is using its assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio measures a company's total revenue relative to the value of its assets. The asset turnover ratio indicates how efficiently the company is using its assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe higher the asset turnover ratio, the more efficient a company is. If a company has a low asset turnover ratio, it is not efficiently using its assets to create revenue.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe asset turnover ratio uses the value of a company's assets in the denominator of the formula. The average value of the assets for the year is determined using the value of the company's assets on the balance sheet as of the start of the year and at the end of the year.\n\nThe sum of the two values is divided by two. Total sales or revenue is found on the company's income statement and is the numerator.\n\nAsset\u00a0Turnover=Total\u00a0SalesBeginning\u00a0Assets+Ending\u00a0Assets2where:Total\u00a0Sales=Annual\u00a0sales\u00a0totalBeginning\u00a0Assets=Assets\u00a0at\u00a0start\u00a0of\u00a0yearEnding\u00a0Assets=Assets\u00a0at\u00a0end\u00a0of\u00a0year\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{ \\text{Total Sales} }{ \\frac { \\text{Beginning Assets}\\ +\\ \\text{Ending Assets} }{ 2 } } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{Total Sales} = \\text{Annual sales total} \\\\ &\\text{Beginning Assets} = \\text{Assets at start of year} \\\\ &\\text{Ending Assets} = \\text{Assets at end of year} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bAsset\u00a0Turnover=2Beginning\u00a0Assets+Ending\u00a0Assets\u200bTotal\u00a0Sales\u200bwhere:Total\u00a0Sales=Annual\u00a0sales\u00a0totalBeginning\u00a0Assets=Assets\u00a0at\u00a0start\u00a0of\u00a0yearEnding\u00a0Assets=Assets\u00a0at\u00a0end\u00a0of\u00a0year\u200b\n\nTypically, the asset turnover ratio is calculated on an annual basis. The higher the asset turnover ratio, the better the company is performing, since higher ratios imply that the company is generating more revenue per dollar of assets.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio tends to be higher for companies in certain sectors than others. Retail and consumer staples, for example, have relatively small asset bases but have high sales volume; thus, they have the highest average asset turnover ratio. Conversely, firms in sectors\u00a0such asutilitiesand real estate have large asset bases and low asset turnover.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio can vary widely from one industry to the next, so comparing the ratios of different sectors, like a retail company with a telecommunications company, would not be productive. Comparisons are only meaningful when they are made for different companies within the same sector.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio for Walmart Inc. (WMT), Target Corporation (TGT), AT&T Inc. (T), and Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) for FY 2024 is shown in the table below.\n\nAT&T and Verizon have asset turnover ratios of less than one, which is typical for firms in the telecommunications-utilities sector. These companies have large asset bases, so it is expected that they will slowly turn over their assets through sales.\n\nIt would not make sense to compare the asset turnover ratios for Walmart and AT&T, since they operate in different industries. Comparing the relative asset turnover ratios for AT&T with Verizon may provide a better estimate of which company is using assets more efficiently in that sector. From the table, Verizon turns over its assets at a faster rate than AT&T.\n\nFor every dollar in assets, Walmart generated $2.62 in sales, while Target generated $1.88. Target's turnover could indicate that the retail company was experiencing sluggish sales or holding\u00a0obsolete inventory. Fixed assets\u00a0such as property or equipment could be sitting idle or not being utilized to their full capacity.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio is a key component ofDuPont analysis, a system that the DuPont Corporation began in the 1920s to evaluate performance across corporate divisions. The first step ofDuPont analysis breaks downreturn on equity\u00a0(ROE) into three components, including asset turnover, profit margin,\u00a0and\u00a0financial leverage.\n\nROE=(Net\u00a0IncomeRevenue)\u23dfProfit\u00a0Margin\u00d7(RevenueAA)\u23dfAsset\u00a0Turnover\u00d7(AAAE)\u23dfFinancial\u00a0Leveragewhere:AA=Average\u00a0assetsAE=Average\u00a0equity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROE} = \\underbrace{ \\left ( \\frac{ \\text{Net Income} }{ \\text{Revenue} } \\right ) }_\\text{Profit Margin} \\times \\underbrace{ \\left ( \\frac{ \\text{Revenue} }{ \\text{AA} } \\right ) }_\\text{Asset Turnover} \\times \\underbrace{ \\left ( \\frac{ \\text{AA} }{ \\text{AE} } \\right ) }_\\text{Financial Leverage} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{AA} = \\text{Average assets} \\\\ &\\text{AE} = \\text{Average equity} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bROE=Profit\u00a0Margin(RevenueNet\u00a0Income\u200b)\u200b\u200b\u00d7Asset\u00a0Turnover(AARevenue\u200b)\u200b\u200b\u00d7Financial\u00a0Leverage(AEAA\u200b)\u200b\u200bwhere:AA=Average\u00a0assetsAE=Average\u00a0equity\u200b\n\nSometimes, investors and analysts are more interested in measuring how quickly a company turns its fixed assets or current assets into sales.\n\nIn these cases, the analyst can use specific ratios, such as thefixed-asset turnover ratioor theworking capital ratio, to calculate the efficiency of these asset classes. The working capital ratio measures how well a company uses its financing from working capital to generate sales or revenue.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio considers the averagetotalassets in the denominator, while the fixed asset turnover ratio looks at only fixed assets.\n\nThe fixed asset\u00a0turnover ratio\u00a0(FAT ratio) is used by analysts to measure operating performance. This efficiency ratio compares net sales on the income statement to fixed assets on the balance sheet to measure a company's ability to generate net sales from its fixed-asset investments, namely\u00a0property, plant, and equipment\u00a0(PP&E).\n\nThe fixed asset balance is the used net of accumulated depreciation.Depreciationis the allocation of the cost of a fixed asset, which is expensed each year throughout the asset's useful life. Typically, a higher fixed asset turnover ratio indicates that a company has more effectively utilized its investment in fixed assets to generate revenue.\n\nThe\u00a0asset turnover ratio\u00a0measures the efficiency of a company's\u00a0assets\u00a0in generating revenue or sales. It compares the dollar amount of sales\u00a0to its total assets as an annualized percentage. Thus, to calculate the asset turnover ratio, divide net sales or revenue by the average total assets. One variation on this metric considers only a company's fixed assets (the FAT ratio) instead of total assets.\n\nWhile investors may use the asset turnover ratio to compare similar stocks, the metric does not provide all of the details that would be helpful for stock analysis. A company's asset turnover ratio in any single year may differ substantially from previous or subsequent years. Investors should review the trend in the asset turnover ratio over time to determine whether asset usage is improving or deteriorating.\n\nAsset turnover ratios vary across different\u00a0industry sectors, so only the ratios of companies that are in the same sector should be compared. For example, retail or service sector companies have relatively small asset bases combined with high sales volume. This leads to a high average asset turnover ratio. Meanwhile, firms in sectors like utilities or manufacturing tend to have large asset bases, which translates to lower asset turnover.\n\nA company may attempt to raise a low asset\u00a0turnover ratio\u00a0by stocking its shelves with highly salable items, replenishing\u00a0inventory\u00a0only when necessary, and augmenting its hours of operation to increase customer foot traffic and spike sales.\n\nJust-in-time(JIT) inventory management, for instance, is a system whereby a firm receives inputs as close as possible to when they are needed. So, if a car assembly plant needs to install airbags, it does not keep a stock of airbags on its shelves but receives them as those cars come onto the assembly line.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio is a metric that compares revenues to assets. A high asset turnover ratio indicates a company that is exceptionally effective at extracting a high level of revenue from a relatively low number of assets. As with other business metrics, the asset turnover ratio is most effective when used to compare different companies in the same industry.\n\nWalmart. \"Annual Report 2024,\" Pages 54-56.\n\nTarget. \"2024 Annual Report,\" Pages 42-44.\n\nAT&T. \"2024 Annual Report,\" Pages 41-43.\n\nVerizon. \"Form 10K for the Period Ended Dec. 31, 2024,\" Pages 54-56.",
