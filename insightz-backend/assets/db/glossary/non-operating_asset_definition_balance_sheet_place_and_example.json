  "term": "Non-Operating Asset: Definition, Balance Sheet Place, and Example",
  "definition": "A non-operating asset is a class of assets that are not essential to the ongoing operations of a business but may still generate income or provide areturn on investment(ROI). These assets are listed on a company'sbalance sheetalong with its operating assets, and they may or may not be broken out separately.\n\nNon-operating assets are also known as redundant assets because they do not support operations and are therefore considered to be redundant and expendable if a company needs to cash them in. That said, companies hold non-operating assets for several reasons. For example, a company may own a parcel of land assessed at $300,000 in value but has no plans to build on the property for at least five years. Until it is used, the land is considered to be a non-operating asset.\n\nCommon non-operating assets include unallocated cash andmarketable securities, loansreceivable, idle equipment, and vacant land. The correct identification of non-operating assets is an important step in the valuation process because these can often be overlooked by analysts and investors. Furthermore, analysis based on acash flowsapproach will not capture the value of non-operating assets. These assets have to be valued separately and added to the operating value of the business.\n\nNon-operating assets may be assets related to a closed portion of the business. In this case, the company can choose to hold onto the assets with the intention of selling or using them in the future. For example, imagine a business owns several retail locations and it closes one of its locations. The business operations in that building have ceased and the company still owns the building. Because the building is no longer instrumental in the business's day-to-day operations, it is labeled as non-operating. However, the building still holds value that could be tapped into in the future, so it is also considered anasset.\n\nIn other cases, non-operating assets can be used to diversifyoperational risks. For example, a business may own some real estate or patents simply ascash investments. Although these assets are not tied to the business's operations, the company\u00a0may still earn some revenue from them. If the business loses money through its operations, these non-operating assets can providediversificationand act as a financial backup.\n\nNon-operating incomerefers to revenue an organization earns that is not connected to its core operations. In some cases, non-operating income comes from non-operating assets. To continue with the above example, if the business rents out its empty retail location, the money it collects in rent is non-operating income.\n\nSimilarly, if a company has investments that are not related to its operations, the returns it earns on those investments are classified as non-operating income. In recent years, large corporations realized the risk of being disrupted by rising startups, so they created corporateventure capitalarms that invest in new ideas that are not necessarily related to their operations where they own assets and generate income as a diversification tool.\n\nHowever, non-operating income does not always come from non-operating assets. It may also include gains from foreign exchanges or other forms of peripheral income such as a one-time gain on investment securities. Non-operating assets may also generate liabilities for the company holding them. For example, a company holding onto unused land will haveliabilityexposure in the form of taxes due, interest owed,\u00a0or lawsuits generated by accidents on that property.\n\nNon-operating assets are usually treated separately from operating assets when evaluating a company or its stock. The value of non-operating assets does count toward the total worth of the company, however, their value is excluded from financial models that estimate the future growth or profitearning potentialof the core business segments. Although non-operating assets may bring revenue into a company, they are not used to generate core revenue.",
