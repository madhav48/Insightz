  "term": "Dollarization Definition, Impact, and Example",
  "definition": "Dollarization occurs when the domestic currency of one country is substituted for another\u2014usually the U.S. dollar. As such, dollarization is a form ofcurrency substitution. A country typically adopts dollarization when hyperinflation or economic instability causes its currency to lose its usefulness in theforeign exchange (FX) market. Some governments may adopt some form of dollarization as they try to develop their economies.\n\nAs noted above, dollarization is a form of currency substitution. Governments may choose to partially or fully adopt a foreign currency (typically theU.S. dollar) in addition to or instead of their own. This usually occurs in developing countries with a weak central monetary authority or an unstable economy.\n\nDollarization may become an official monetary policy or a de facto market process. As such, the U.S. dollar becomes the generally accepted currency for day-to-day transactions in the economy. Sometimes the dollar assumes official status aslegal tenderin the country.\n\nGovernments adopt dollarization to benefit from the U.S. dollar's stability. For example, the citizens of a country within an economy that is undergoing rampant inflation may choose to usethe U.S. dollarto conduct day-to-day transactions, since inflation will cause their domestic currency to have reducedbuying power.\n\nAnother aspect of dollarization is that the country gives up some of its ability to influence its own economy through monetary policy by adjusting its money supply. The dollarizing country effectivelyoutsourcestheir monetary policy to theU.S. Federal Reserve.This can be a negative factor, to the extent that U.S. period monetary policy is set in the interest of the U.S. economy and not the interests of dollarized countries.\n\nDollarization may become the currency of choice by government decree or through adoption by market participants,\n\nIn certain cases, dollarization can help countries whose authorities aren't competent enough to manage their monetary policy. It allows these nations to economize on resources that would need to be devoted to supplying and managing their money supply by taking advantage of aneconomy of scalein monetary policy.\n\nWhatever the reason, giving up an independent monetary policy can move the dollarizing country closer to anoptimal currency areawith the dollar. Small countries that engage in a relatively large volume of trade with and have strong economic ties to the U.S. will especially benefit.\n\nZimbabwe tested dollarization to see if it could stabilize its economy by staving highinflation, which reached an estimated rate of 2.2 million percent in July 2008.Officials announced the adoption of the U.S. dollar aslegal tenderfor certain merchandisers and retailers before formally adopting and legalizing its general use in 2009. This led to the suspension of the Zimbabwe dollar in 2015.\n\nDollarization in Zimbabwe immediately reduced inflation and instability in the overall economy by increasingpurchasing powerand realizing increased economic growth. Long-term economic planning also became easier since the stable dollar attracted someforeign investment.\n\nZimbabwe banned the use of foreign currencies, including the U.S. dollar, when it introduced a new currency in 2019. This new unit was called the Real Time Gross Settlement dollar. The goal was to eliminate theblack marketthat existed under the U.S. dollar and help fuel economic growth.This change in dependency on foreign currencies is known asde-dollarization.\n\nIn April 2024, the country's government rolled out an even newer currency called the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG). Banks were told they would need to swap the ZiG for the Zimbabwe dollar. The new currency would becirculatedwith other foreign currencies in the economy.The move was prompted by the need to stabilize prices and the economy, foster confidence in the country's financial system, and increase demand for local currency.\n\nDollarization can help nations that are going through tough economic times stabilize their economies by fully or partially adopting a foreign currency. Although it can help, there are disadvantages. For instance, the government gives up control over its monetary policy since the currency of choice is regulated by another nation. It also loses seigniorage or the profits related to the minting and printing of its money. Central banks of countries that fully dollarize also give up the right to become the lender of last resort for banks in their financial systems.\n\nDollarization occurs when a country fully or partially adopts a foreign currency in addition to or in place of its own. This is usually done with the U.S. dollar by countries that experience extreme economic instability and/or hyperinflation. It can have a positive, lasting effect on a nation's economy by stabilizing capital markets, protecting the economy against devaluation and inflation, and minimizing exchange rate risk. But it does come with certain disadvantages, including the loss of control over monetary policy.\n\nDollarization helps boost global confidence in the U.S. dollar and generates positive sentiment among global investors. Full dollarization also gives the U.S. federal government more seigniorage, which is defined as the \"profits accruing to the monetary authority from its right to issue currency.\"\n\nDollarization is the process of adopting a foreign currency either fully or partially to help a nation's economy. There have been several notable cases where countries adopted the U.S. dollar to combat hyperinflation, including Zimbabwe. Once the economy is stable, the country may choose to de-dollarize and revert back to a local currency. This was the case with the African nation, which outlawed use of the greenback and began using its own currency once again..\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Costs and Benefits of Dollarization,\" Page 4.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Costs and Benefits of Dollarization,\" Pages 4-5.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Costs and Benefits of Dollarization,\" Pages 7-8.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"Costs and Benefits of Dollarization,\" Pages 8-9.\n\nThe New York Times. \"Zimbabwe Pegs Inflation at 2.2 Million Percent.\"\n\nGlobal Financial Data. \"The Death of the Zimbabwe Dollar.\"\n\nCato Institute. \"Dollarization: The Case of Zimbabwe,\" Pages 348-349.\n\nCato Institute. \"Dollarization: The Case of Zimbabwe,\" Page 349.\n\nCato Institute. \"Dollarization: The Case of Zimbabwe,\" Pages 358-360.\n\nBBC News. \"Why Zimbabwe has banned foreign currencies.\"\n\nReserve Bank of Zimbabwe. \"2024 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT,\" Page 65.\n\nReserve Bank of Zimbabwe. \"2024 MONETARY POLICY STATEMENT,\" Pages 5-7.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Full Dollarization.\"",
