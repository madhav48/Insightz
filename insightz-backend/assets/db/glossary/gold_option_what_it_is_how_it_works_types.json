  "definition": "A gold option is anoptions contractthat utilizes either physical gold or gold futures as itsunderlying asset.\n\nA goldcall optionwould give the holder the right,\u00a0but not the obligation, to buy bullion at a future date at a set price, while aput optionwould grant the holder the right to sell it at a predetermined price level. The option agreement terms will list details such as the delivery date, quantity, and strike price, which are all predetermined.\n\nA gold option\u00a0is aderivativethat has physical gold, orfutureson physical gold, as the underlying asset.\n\nThe gold options contract is an agreement between two parties to facilitate a potential transaction on a quantity ofgold.\u00a0The contract lists a preset price, known\u00a0as thestrike price, and an expiration date.\n\nThere are two primary types of options contracts: put options and call options. However, there are four types of participants, as both the call and put can be\u00a0either bought or sold.\n\nIf the holders of call or put options do not exercise their rights, the contract will expire as\u00a0worthless.\n\nA gold option is similar in some ways to a goldfutures contractin that the price, the expiration date, and the dollar amount are preset for both. However, with a\u00a0futures contract, there is an obligation to uphold the agreement and either buy or sell the agreed-upon quantity of gold at the agreed-upon price.\n\nConversely, an investor who holds a gold option has the right, but not the obligation, to claim the relevant position, which will depend on if they hold the call option or the put option.\n\nGold options contracts trade on various derivativesexchangesaround the world. In the U.S., investors can find gold options listed on theCOMEXexchange.\n\nCOMEX is the primary futures and options market for trading metals such as gold, silver, copper, and aluminum. Formerly known as the Commodity Exchange Inc., COMEX merged with theNew York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX)in 1994 and became the division responsible for metals trading.Today, COMEX\u2014and the NYMEX more broadly\u2014operates as a division of theChicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).\n\nCOMEX gold options actually use gold futures, rather than physical gold directly, and so arecash-settled. These gold futures have a contract size of 100troy ounceseach and requirephysical deliveryif not closed out.\n\nIt is possible to experience significant losses with gold options.\n\nAs with other types of options, an investor would only want to exercise their gold option rights if the market conditions make it beneficial.\n\nIf at the time the buyer can use, or exercise, their call option, gold is trading at a price significantly higher than the strike price, the investor would benefit by exercising their option. The investor could then turn around and quickly sell that gold on the openmarketfor a quick profit.\n\nShould, on the other hand, gold be trading at or near the strike price, the investor maybreak evenor perhaps even take a loss once their initial cost to purchase the option is factored in.\n\nGold options are available the U.S. through the\u00a0Chicago Mercantile Exchange\u00a0(CME). These options contracts use gold futures as their underlying asset. To trade gold options, you will need a margin brokerage account with access to options markets. You could contact your current broker to see if they offer options trading or shop around for anoptions trading account.\n\nCall options on gold give the contract holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy the metal at a preset price before the contract expires. A call option increases in value when the price of gold increases, as it locks in a lower buying price. Meanwhile, put options give the contract holder the right to sell gold at a predetermined level before the expiration date. As gold prices decline, a put option becomes more valuable, as it locks in a higher selling price.\n\nGold options allow traders to take out a position on gold using less up-front capital than they would by trading the physical metal or gold futures contracts. However, if gold prices move in an unfavorable direction, options can result in significant losses.\n\nGold options give the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell gold at a specific price, up until the contract expires. With a call option, the contract holder reserves the right to buy gold at a specific price, while a put option holder reserves the right to sell at a predetermined level. To trade gold options, it is necessary to have a margin brokerage account offering access to options markets.\n\nCME Group. \"Gold Option - Contract Specs.\" Accessed Feb. 19, 2021.\n\nCME Group. \"Designated Contract Markets.\" Accessed Feb. 19, 2021.\n\nU.S. Federal Election Commission. \"Subject: New York Mercantile Exchange,\" Page 1.
