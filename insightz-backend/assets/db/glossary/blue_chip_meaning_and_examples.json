  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA blue chip is a publicly traded company known for its stability, consistent earnings, sound financials, and long-standing reputation.\n\nA blue chip company is widely considered a solid long-term investment due to its established position in its industry. Blue chips have a large market share, seasoned management, solid and reliable financials, and brand recognition.\n\nCompanies that are deemed blue chips have reputable brands that have been built and maintained over many years and have weathered multiple downturns in the economy. This contributes to their long records of steady growth.\n\nThe term \"blue chip\" was first used in 1923 by Oliver Gingold, an employee of Dow Jones, to describe stocks that traded at $200 or more per share. It relates to blue, white, and red poker chips, with the blue chips having the greatest value.\n\nBlue chip stocks aren't necessarily stocks with a high price tag. They're shares of high-quality companies in healthy financial condition that have withstood the tests of time.\n\nA blue chip stock is generally a component of the most reputable market indexes or averages, such as theDow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500, and the Nasdaq-100 in the United States, the TSX-60 in Canada, and theFTSEIndex in the United Kingdom. They're usually listed on major stock exchanges such as the NYSE and the Nasdaq.\n\nHow large a company must be to qualify for blue chip status is open to debate. A generally accepted benchmark is a market capitalization of $10 billion, although market or sector leaders can be companies of all sizes.\n\nMany conservative investors with low-risk profiles or those who are nearing retirement might prefer blue chip stocks. They can offer capital preservation and consistent dividend payments for income and protection against inflation.\n\nBenjamin Graham suggests in his book, \"The Intelligent Investor,\" that conservative investors look for companies that have paid dividends consistently for 20 years or more.\n\nTheDividend Aristocratstock list published by Standard and Poor\u2019s is made up of large-cap blue chip companies in the S&P 500 that have increased dividends every year for 25 years.\n\nA blue chip company can be a multinational firm that has operated successfully for several years, is a dominant leader in its industry, and is widely recognized.\n\nBlue chip stocks are seen as less volatile investments than shares in companies without blue chip status because of their noteworthy institutional profile and longstanding financial health. They share some other characteristics as well.\n\nAn investor can track the performance of blue chip stocks through a blue chip index, and this can also be seen as an indicator of industry or economic performance.\n\nA blue chip company will have survived financial challenges and\u00a0difficult market cycles over the years. It will have turned in a steady return and typically paid dividends year in and year out. It can be perceived as a safe investment as a result.\n\nThis doesn't make it bulletproof, however. The\u00a0bankruptcies\u00a0of General Motors andLehman Brothersduring the\u00a0global recession\u00a0of 2007-2009, as well as several leading European banks, show that even the best companies can struggle during periods of extreme stress.\n\nBlue chip stocks can be appropriate for the core holdings of a large portfolio but they shouldn't be the only investments. A diversified portfolio usually has some allocation of bonds and cash in addition to stocks. A portfolio's allocation to stocks can be diversified among large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps as well as domestic and international stocks.\n\nYounger investors can generally tolerate the risk of having a larger percentage of their portfolios in growth stocks that include some blue chips because they have years to invest and recover from market mishaps. Investors who are approaching retirement might choose to focus more on capital preservation by putting a larger percentage of their investments in bonds and cash.\n\nBlue Chips come with pros and cons, just as all investments do.\n\nLow risk:Blue chip companies are considered to be low risk because they're industry leaders with reliable cash flows and long histories of paying their debts. They're unlikely to suffer from sudden credit or liquidity crunches.\n\nReliable return:Blue chip companies typically provide reliable growth potential as well as consistent dividend payments.\n\nLow volatility:Blue chips are seen as stable companies/stocks due to their well-tested business models, established operations, dependable revenue, and long-lived brands.\n\nLess effort:The dependability and lower volatility they offer can mean less need for concern and monitoring.\n\nLower returns:Returns can be reliable, but well-established, mature companies such as blue chips offer more modest returns than smaller startups that have room for greater and more rapid growth.\n\nMore Expensive:Blue chips tend to be in greater demand and more expensive than stocks of other companies of comparable size because of their lower risk, reliable return potential, and lower volatility.\n\nLower returns than less established companies\n\nLess room to grow, so they're unlikely to see large gains\n\nInvestors can buy individual blue chip stocks through a broker. They can also invest in blue chips by buying a fund that targets large-cap companies or market leaders. Many of these companies may be considered blue chips but investors can also gain useful exposure to other companies.\n\nInvestors can also buy mutual funds and ETFs that specifically target blue chip companies, giving them exposure to an entire basket of blue chip stocks with a single investment. Most asset managers offer one or more blue chip-focused funds, including Fidelity and BlackRock.\n\nIf you're just starting to invest but don't really know where to start, blue chip stocks can be a smart place to begin. These companies are well-established and better positioned to weather economic ups and downs, especially when compared to smaller or less-established companies.\n\nWhether you're putting together your first investment portfolio or just looking for a safe place to invest, blue chips offer steady growth while you determine what riskier bets suit your investment profile.\n\nMany blue chips also generate income through dividends. This is particularly important if you're nearing or in retirement and looking to keep your savings steady. Blue chips aren't \"cool,\" but they'll keep your portfolio grounded and growing.\n\nCommon examples of blue chip stocks include market leaders like IBM, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's. These are companies with long track records of steady growth and low volatility, suggesting that they're unlikely to face major problems in the near future.\n\nBlue chips are characterized by a high credit rating, large market capitalization, and a listing on the NYSE or another major stock exchange. They're often listed in a major stock market index and compiled lists of large-cap stocks.\n\nA blue chip NFT is a digital artwork or collectible issued by one of the more reputable players in the market fornon-fungible tokens. These companies are relatively well-established in the NFT space so they're considered less risky than some of their upstart competitors. It may be a stretch to apply the blue chip label to such a speculative asset, however, because digital assets represent a risky market.\n\nYou can invest in blue chip stocks through a stock brokerage such as Fidelity or Charles Schwab. Simply search for the company's ticker symbol in the broker's stock screener. Many asset managers also run mutual funds or index funds that specifically target blue chip securities, making it easy to invest in a basket of such companies.\n\nThe term \"blue chip\" comes from the game of poker, where blue chips are usually the most valuable ones on the table. It was first used by Oliver Gingold, an employee at Dow Jones, who observed that certain stocks reliably traded above $200 per share. Some blue chips trade in the thousands per share in the 2020s.\n\n\"Blue chip\" is an informal term for the most reliable and valuable companies on the market. They're usually companies with a long track record of financial stability. They're typically leaders within their industry, so they're often sought after and considered to be low-risk investments.\n\nHerold Financial Dictionary. \"What are Blue Chip Stocks?\"\n\nNovel Investor. \"The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham.\"\n\nABC News. \"2008's Financial Winner's and Losers.\"",
