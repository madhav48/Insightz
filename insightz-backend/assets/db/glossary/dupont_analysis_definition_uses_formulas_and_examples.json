Before joining Investopedia, she consulted for a global financial institution on cybersecurity policies and conducted research as a Research Analyst at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nThe DuPont analysis is a formula that assesses how effectively a company is using the capital invested by its shareholders by dividing the company's net income by its shareholder equity.\n\nThe DuPont analysis is a framework for analyzing a company's fundamental performance. Developed decades ago at DuPont de Nemours, Inc., the DuPont analysis breaks out the different drivers of return on equity (ROE), allowing company managers and investors to focus on them individually and identify strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThere are two versions of the tool\u2014one that involves three steps and another that uses five.\n\nThe DuPont analysis is a formula used to evaluate a company's financial performance based on its return on equity (ROE). By most accounts, it wasdevised in 1919by a DuPont executive.\n\nA company's ROE is calculated bydividing its net income by shareholders' equity. It reveals how well a company utilizes capital from shareholders.\n\nA DuPont analysis goes a step further and allows an investor to determine which financial activities contribute the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can also use the DuPont analysis to compare theoperational efficiencyof two similar companies, while company managers can use it to identify strengths or weaknesses that should be addressed.\n\nThere are three major financial metrics that drive ROE:\n\nThe DuPont analysis is an expanded return on equity formula, calculated by multiplying the net profit margin by the asset turnover by theequity multiplier.\n\nDuPont\u00a0Analysis=Net\u00a0Profit\u00a0Margin\u00d7AT\u00d7EMwhere:Net\u00a0Profit\u00a0Margin=Net\u00a0IncomeRevenueAT=Asset\u00a0turnoverAsset\u00a0Turnover=SalesAverage\u00a0Total\u00a0AssetsEM=Equity\u00a0multiplierEquity\u00a0Multiplier=Average\u00a0Total\u00a0AssetsAverage\u00a0Shareholders\u2019\u00a0Equity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{DuPont Analysis} = \\text{Net Profit Margin} \\times \\text{AT} \\times \\text{EM} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{Net Profit Margin} = \\frac{ \\text{Net Income} }{ \\text{Revenue} } \\\\ &\\text{AT} = \\text{Asset turnover} \\\\ &\\text{Asset Turnover} = \\frac{ \\text{Sales} }{ \\text{Average Total Assets} } \\\\ &\\text{EM} = \\text{Equity multiplier} \\\\ &\\text{Equity Multiplier} = \\frac{ \\text{Average Total Assets} }{ \\text{Average Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bDuPont\u00a0Analysis=Net\u00a0Profit\u00a0Margin\u00d7AT\u00d7EMwhere:Net\u00a0Profit\u00a0Margin=RevenueNet\u00a0Income\u200bAT=Asset\u00a0turnoverAsset\u00a0Turnover=Average\u00a0Total\u00a0AssetsSales\u200bEM=Equity\u00a0multiplierEquity\u00a0Multiplier=Average\u00a0Shareholders\u2019\u00a0EquityAverage\u00a0Total\u00a0Assets\u200b\u200b\n\nThe DuPont analysis is also known as theDuPont identityor DuPont model.\n\nAs mentioned, a DuPont analysis breaks ROE into its constituent components to determine which of these factors are most responsible for changes in ROE.\n\nThe net profit margin is the ratio of bottom line profits compared to total revenue or total sales. This is one of the most basic measures of profitability.\n\nOne way to think about the net margin is to imagine a store that sells a certain product for $1. After the costs associated with buying inventory, maintaining a location, and paying employees, taxes, interest, and other expenses, the store owner keeps $0.15 in profit from each unit sold. That means the owner's profit margin is 15%, which can be calculated as follows:\n\nProfit\u00a0Margin=Net\u00a0IncomeRevenue=$0.15$1.00=15%\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Profit Margin} = \\frac{ \\text{Net Income} }{ \\text{Revenue} } = \\frac{ \\$0.15 }{ \\$1.00 } = 15\\% \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bProfit\u00a0Margin=RevenueNet\u00a0Income\u200b=$1.00$0.15\u200b=15%\u200b\n\nThe profit margin could be improved if costs for the owner were reduced or if prices on the product were raised, which could have a large impact on ROE. This is one of the reasons that a company's stock will experience high levels ofvolatilitywhen management makes a change to its guidance for future margins, costs, and prices.\n\nThe asset turnover ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its assets to generate revenue. Imagine a company that had $100 in assets and made $1,000 of total revenue last year. The assets generated 10 times their value in total revenue, which is the same as the asset turnover ratio and can be calculated as follows:\n\nAsset\u00a0Turnover\u00a0Ratio=RevenueAverage\u00a0Assets=$1,000$100=10\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Asset Turnover Ratio} = \\frac{ \\text{Revenue} }{ \\text{Average Assets} } = \\frac{ \\$1,000 }{ \\$100 } = 10 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bAsset\u00a0Turnover\u00a0Ratio=Average\u00a0AssetsRevenue\u200b=$100$1,000\u200b=10\u200b\n\nA normal asset turnover ratio will vary from one industry group to another. For example, a discount retailer or grocery store will generate a lot of revenue from its assets with a small margin, which will make the asset turnover ratio very large.\n\nOn the other hand, a utility company owns very expensive fixed assets relative to its revenue, which will result in an asset turnover ratio that is much lower than that of a retail firm.\n\nThe ratio can be helpful when comparing two companies that operate in the same industry. Because average assets include components like inventory, changes in this ratio can signal that sales are slowing down or speeding up earlier than they would show up in other financial measures. If a company's asset turnover rises, its ROE improves.\n\nFinancial leverage, or the equity multiplier, is an indirect analysis of a company's use of debt to finance its assets. Assume a company has $1,000 in assets and $250 of owner's equity. The balance sheet equation will tell you that the company also has $750 in debt (assets - liabilities = equity).\n\nIf the company borrows more to purchase assets, the ratio will continue to rise. The accounts used to calculate financial leverage are both on the balance sheet, so analysts will divide average assets by average equity rather than the balance at the end of the period, as follows:\n\nFinancial\u00a0Leverage=Average\u00a0AssetsAverage\u00a0Equity=$1,000$250=4\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Financial Leverage} = \\frac{ \\text{Average Assets} }{ \\text{Average Equity} } = \\frac{ \\$1,000 }{ \\$250 } = 4 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bFinancial\u00a0Leverage=Average\u00a0EquityAverage\u00a0Assets\u200b=$250$1,000\u200b=4\u200b\n\nMost companies should use debt with equity to fund operations and growth. Not using any leverage could put the company at a disadvantage compared with its peers. However, using too much debt in order to increase the financial leverage ratio\u2014and therefore increase ROE\u2014can create disproportionate risks.\n\nA point to note, though, is that some companies use balance sheet averages when one of the components is an income statement metric. In the case illustrated above, no averaging is necessary as the equation takes balance sheet/balance sheet figures into account.\n\nThe biggestdrawback of the DuPont analysisis that it still relies on accounting equations and data that can be manipulated. Plus, even with its comprehensiveness, the DuPont analysis lacks context as to why the individual ratios are high or low, or even whether they should be considered high or low at all.\n\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how the DuPont analysis works. Let's say an investor has been watching two similar companies, SuperCo and Gear Inc. Both of these companies have improved their return on equity compared to the rest of theirpeer group, which could be a good thing if the two companies make better use of assets or improve profit margins.\n\nIn order to decide which company is a better opportunity, the investor decides to use the DuPont analysis to determine what each company has done to improve its ROE and whether that improvement is sustainable.\n\nAs you can see in the table, SuperCo improved its profit margins by increasing its net income and reducing its total assets. SuperCo's changes improved its profit margin and asset turnover. The investor can deduce that SuperCo also reduced some of its debt since average equity remained the same.\n\nLooking closely at Gear, the investor can see that the entire change in ROE was due to an increase in financial leverage. This means the company borrowed more money, which reduced average equity. The investor is concerned because the additional debt didn't change the company's net income, revenue, or profit margin. As such, the leverage may not add any real value.\n\nNow, let's consider Walmart (WMT). For the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2025, the company reported:\n\nBased on these figures, we can deduce that the company had the following:\n\nUsing a DuPont analysis, Walmart's return on equity (ROE) for the fiscal year was 19.9% (or 2.85% x 2.61 x 2.68).\n\nDuPont analysis is a useful technique for examining the different drivers of return on equity for a business. This allows an investor to see what financial activities are contributing the most to the changes in ROE. An investor can use\u00a0an analysis\u00a0like this to compare the operational efficiency of two similar firms.\n\nThere are two versions of DuPont analysis, one using three steps, the other five steps. The three-step equation breaks ROE into three components:\n\nROE=Net\u00a0IncomeSales\u00d7SalesAssets\u00d7AssetsShareholders\u2019\u00a0Equity\\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROE} = \\frac{ \\text{Net Income} }{ \\text{Sales} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{Sales} }{ \\text{Assets} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{Assets} }{ \\text{Shareholders' Equity} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bROE=SalesNet\u00a0Income\u200b\u00d7AssetsSales\u200b\u00d7Shareholders\u2019\u00a0EquityAssets\u200b\u200b\n\nThe five-step version instead is:\n\nROE=EBTS\u00d7SA\u00d7AE\u00d7(1\u2212TR)where:EBT=Earnings\u00a0before\u00a0taxS=SalesA=AssetsE=EquityTR=Tax\u00a0rate\\begin{aligned} &\\text{ROE} = \\frac{ \\text{EBT} }{ \\text{S} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{S} }{ \\text{A} } \\times \\frac{ \\text{A} }{ \\text{E} } \\times ( 1 - \\text{TR} ) \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{EBT} = \\text{Earnings before tax} \\\\ &\\text{S} = \\text{Sales} \\\\ &\\text{A} = \\text{Assets} \\\\ &\\text{E} = \\text{Equity} \\\\ &\\text{TR} = \\text{Tax rate} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bROE=SEBT\u200b\u00d7AS\u200b\u00d7EA\u200b\u00d7(1\u2212TR)where:EBT=Earnings\u00a0before\u00a0taxS=SalesA=AssetsE=EquityTR=Tax\u00a0rate\u200b\n\nDuPont analysis was developed at DuPont de Nemours, Inc., better known simply as DuPont.\n\nWhile the DuPont analysis can be a very helpful tool for managers, analysts, and investors, it is not without its weaknesses. It requires several inputs and, as with any calculation, the reliability of the results depends on the accuracy of the inputs.\n\nFor example, this tool utilizes data from a company's\u00a0income statement\u00a0and\u00a0balance sheet, some of which may not be entirely accurate. Even if the data used for calculations are reliable, there are still additional potential problems, such as the difficulty of determining therelative valuesof ratios as good or bad compared to industry norms.\n\nSeasonal factors, depending on the industry, can also be an important consideration since these factors can distort ratios. For instance, some companies always carry a higher level of inventory at certain times of the year. Differentaccounting practicesbetween companies can also make accurate comparisons difficult.\n\nThe DuPont analysis is a useful tool for evaluating the components that make up a company's ROE calculation. Whether you're a stock analyst, an investor, or a manager, you can use the DuPont analysis to understand what drives a company's ROE, spot the causes for any shift in its ROE, and compare its financial performance to that of its competitors. Just keep in mind the limitations of this formula as it relates to the quality of the inputs.\n\nDavid C. Burns, et al. \"A Better Way to Gauge Profitability.\"Journal of Accountancy.
