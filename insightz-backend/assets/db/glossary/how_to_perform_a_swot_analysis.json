  "definition": "These frameworks are essential to fundamentally analyzing companies\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA SWOT analysis identifies a company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.\n\nA SWOT analysis helps define a company's competitive position, assesses internal and external issues, and evaluates its current and future potential. It is a realistic, fact-based, data-driven analysis of an organization.\n\nA SWOT analysis is a technique for assessing the performance, competition, risk, and potential of a business, as well as a part of a business, such as a product line or division, an industry, or other entity.\n\nUsing internal and external data, the technique can guide businesses toward strategies more likely to be successful, and away from those in which they have been (or are likely to be) less successful. Independent SWOT analysts, investors, or competitors can also guide them on whether a company, product line, or industry might be strong or weak and why.\n\nThe SWOT analysis was first used to analyze businesses. Now, it's often used by governments, nonprofits, and individuals, including investors and entrepreneurs. There are seemingly limitless applications to the SWOT analysis.\n\nEvery SWOT analysis includes four categories. Though the elements and discoveries within these categories will vary from company to company, a SWOT analysis is not complete without each of the following elements.\n\nAnalysts present a SWOT analysis as a square segmented into four quadrants, each dedicated to an element of SWOT. This visual arrangement provides a quick overview of the company\u2019s position. Although all the points under a particular heading may not be of equal importance, they all should represent key insights into the balance of opportunities and threats, advantages and disadvantages, and so forth.\n\nThe SWOT table is often laid out with the internal factors on the top row and the external factors on the bottom row. In addition, the items on the left side of the table are more positive/favorable aspects, while the items on the right are more concerning/negative elements.\n\nA SWOT analysis can be broken into several steps with actionable items before and after analyzing the four components. A SWOT analysis generally involves the following steps.\n\nA SWOT analysis can be broad, though more value will likely be generated if the analysis is pointed directly at an objective. For example, the objective of a SWOT analysis may be focused only on whether or not to perform a new productrollout.\n\nWith an objective in mind, a company will have guidance on what it hopes to achieve at the end of the process. In this example, the SWOT analysis should help determine whether or not the product should be introduced.\n\nEvery SWOT analysis varies and a company may need different data sets to support pulling together different SWOT analysis tables. A company should begin by understanding what information it has access to, what data limitations it faces, and how reliable its external data sources are.\n\nA company must also have the right combination of personnel involved in the analysis. Some staff may be more connected with external forces, while others within themanufacturingor sales departments may have a better grasp of what is going on internally. Having a broad set of perspectives is also more likely to yield diverse, value-adding contributions.\n\nThe group of people assigned to perform the analysis should begin listing ideas within each category. Examples of questions to ask or consider for each group are in the table below.\n\nInternal factors serve as a great source of information for the strengths and weaknesses categories of the SWOT analysis. Examples include financial andhuman resources, tangible and intangible (brand name) assets, and operational efficiencies.\n\nPotential questions to list internal factors are:\n\nExternal factors are equally important to a company's success as internal factors. Influences likemonetary policies, market changes, and access to suppliers are categories to pull from to create a list of opportunities and weaknesses.\n\nPotential questions to list external factors are:\n\nCompanies may consider performing this step as a white boarding or sticky note session. The idea is there is no right or wrong answer; all participants should be encouraged to share whatever thoughts they have. These ideas can later be discarded; in the meantime, the goal should be to come up with as many items as possible to invoke creativity and inspiration in others.\n\nClean up the ideas. By refining the thoughts that everyone had, a company can focus on only the best ideas or the largest risks to the company. This stage may require substantial debate among analysis participants, including bringing inupper managementto help rank priorities.\n\nConvert the SWOT analysis into a strategic plan. Members of the analysis team take the bulleted list of items within each category and create a synthesized plan that guides the original objective.\n\nFor example, the company debating whether to release a new product may have identified that it is the market leader for its existing product, and there is an opportunity to expand to new markets. However, increased material costs, strained distribution lines, the need for additional staff, and unpredictable product demand may outweigh the strengths and opportunities.\n\nThe analysis team develops the strategy to revisit the decision in six months, in hopes that costs decline and market demand becomes more transparent.\n\nWhen preparing a SWOT analysis, several common mistakes can undermine its effectiveness. Let's take a look at some ways your SWOT analysis may go awry.\n\nOne easy error to make is failing to be objective and honest in the assessment. Companies tend to overemphasize their strengths while downplaying weaknesses, resulting in an overly optimistic and unrealistic analysis. This bias can lead to missed opportunities for improvement and leave the organization vulnerable to unforeseen threats. As honesty may be difficult in your analysis, the validity of underlying assumptions is the cornerstone of how useful the SWOT analysis will be.\n\nAnother significant mistake is analyzing in isolation, without input from diverse key stakeholders. You should try to get input from employees at various levels, customers, suppliers, and industry experts. Each may have a unique view of your company, and each may come up with different items to be listed in each quadrant based on how they specifically interact with the company.\n\nUse a SWOT analysis to identify challenges affecting your business and opportunities that can enhance it. However, note that it is one of many techniques, not a prescription.\n\nAnother common pitfall is neglecting to prioritize or weigh the factors identified in the SWOT analysis. Not all strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats are equally important or impactful. Failing to distinguish between major and minor factors can lead to misallocation of resources and misguided strategic decisions. It can be easy for the important items to be buried if too many non-material items are identified.\n\nAnother frequent error is treating the SWOT analysis as a one-time exercise. You should be prepared to do a SWOT analysis periodically, The business environment is constantly changing, and a SWOT analysis should be regularly updated to remain relevant. The analysis itself is also just the beginning; its true value lies in using the findings to develop and implement strategic actions. You can then check future SWOT analysis to make sure the company is addressing the major points.\n\nA SWOT analysis won't solve every major question. However, there are benefits to a SWOT analysis that make strategic decision-making easier.\n\nIt can be applied to almost every business question.The analysis can relate to an organization, team, or individual. It can also analyze a fullproduct line, changes to brands, geographical expansion, or an acquisition. The analysis versatile tool with many applications.\n\nLet's perform a SWOT analysis by analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThe four steps of SWOT analysis comprise the acronym SWOT: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. These four aspects can be broken into two analytical steps. First, a company assesses its internal capabilities and determines its strengths and weaknesses. Then, a company looks outward and evaluates external factors that impact its business. These external factors may create opportunities or threaten existing operations.\n\nCreating a SWOT analysis involves identifying and analyzing the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a company. It is recommended to first create a list of questions to answer for each element. The questions serve as a guide for completing the SWOT analysis and creating a balanced list. The SWOT framework can be constructed in list format, as free text, or, most commonly, as a 4-cell table, with quadrants dedicated to each element. Strengths and weaknesses are listed first, followed by opportunities and threats.\n\nA SWOT analysis is used to strategically identify areas of improvement or competitive advantages for a company. In addition to analyzing thing that a company does well, SWOT analysis takes a look at more detrimental, negative elements of a business. Using this information, a company can make smarter decisions to preserve what it does well, capitalize on its strengths, mitigate risk regarding weaknesses, and plan for events that may adversely affect the company in the future.\n\nWhile SWOT analysis is a powerful tool, it does have some limitations. It can sometimes oversimplify complex situations and is susceptible to the subjectivity and bias of participants. The analysis also doesn't provide specific guidance on how to address identified issues and can lead to analysis paralysis if not followed by concrete action.\n\nA SWOT analysis is a great way to guide business strategy meetings. A company can use a\u00a0SWOT for overall business strategy sessions or a specific segment such as marketing, production, or sales. This way, you can see how the overall strategy developed from the SWOT analysis will filter down to the segments below before committing to it. You can also work in reverse with\u00a0a segment-specific SWOT analysis that feeds into an overall SWOT analysis.\n\nAlthough a useful planning tool, SWOT has limitations. It is one of several business planning techniques to consider and should not be used alone. Also, each point listed within the categories is not prioritized the same. SWOT does not account for the differences in weight. Therefore, a deeper analysis is needed, using another planning technique.\n\nBusiness News Daily. \"SWOT Analysis: What It Is and When to Use It.\"\n\nReuters. \"Tesla Quarterly Deliveries Decline for the First Time in Nearly Four Years.\"\n\nTesla. \"Autopilot and Full Self-Driving Capability.\"",
