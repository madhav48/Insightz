  "definition": "Writing an option refers to selling an options contract in which a fee, orpremium, is collected by thewriterin exchange for the right to buy or sell shares at a future price and date.\n\nTraders write an option by creating a new option contract that sells someone the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price (strike price) on a specific date (expiration date). In other words, the writer of the option can be forced to buy or sell a stock at the strike price.\n\nHowever, for that risk, the option writer receives a premium that the buyer of the option pays. The premium received when writing an option depends upon several factors, including the current price of the stock, when the option expires, and other factors such as the underlying asset\u2019svolatility.\n\nSome of the main benefits of writing an option include:\n\nPremium received immediately: Options writers receive a premium as soon as they sell an option contract.\n\nKeep full premium for expired out of the money options:If the written option expiresout of the money\u2014meaning that the stock price closes below the strike price for a call option, or above the strike price for a put option\u2014the writer keeps the entire premium.\n\nTime decay: Options decline in value due totime decay, which reduces the option writer's risk and liability. Because the writer sold the option for a higher price and has already received a premium, they can buy it back for a lower price.\n\nFlexibility:An options writer has the flexibility to close out their open contracts at any time. The writer removes their obligation by simply buying back their written option in the open market.\n\nEven though an option writer receives a fee, or premium for selling their option contract, there\u2019s the potential to incur a loss. For example, let\u2019s say David thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares will stay flat until the end of the year due to a lackluster launch of the tech company's iPhone 11, so he decides to write a call option with a strike price of $200 that expires on Dec. 20.\n\nUnexpectedly, Apple announces that it plans on delivering a5Gcapability iPhone sooner than expected, and its stock price closes at $275 on the day the option expires. David still has to deliver the stock to the option buyer for $200. That means he will lose $75 per share as he has to buy the stock on the open market for $275 to deliver to his options buyer for $200.\n\nNote that the losses on writing an option are potentially unlimited if the option is written \"naked\"; that is, if there are no other related positions. If, however, somebody writes acovered call(where they are already long the stock), the losses in the call that are sold will be offset by increases in the value of the shares owned.\n\nLet\u2019s assume The Boeing Company (BA) stock is trading at $375 and Sarah owns 100 shares. She believes the stock will trade flat to slightly lower over the next several months as investors wait for news about a possible new order from a major airline.\n\nTom, on the other hand, believes the airline will in fact make the purchase quite a bit sooner than expected, causing the stock to spike in the near term.\n\nBecause of these opinions, Sarah decides to write a $375 November call option (equal to 100 shares) earning a premium of $17.00. At the same time, Tom places an order to buy a $375 November call for $17.00. Consequently, Sarah and Tom\u2019s orders transact which results in a $1,700 credit into Sarah\u2019s bank account, and gives Tom the right to buy her 100 shares of Boeing at $375 at any time before the November expiry date.\n\nSuppose no news is released about when the possible order may occur and so the stock continues to hover around $375 for several weeks. As a result, the option expires worthless, meaning Sarah keeps the $1,700 premium paid by Tom.\n\nAlternatively, assume the airline announces their purchase in the next few days and Boeing\u2019s stock jumps to $450. In this case, Tom exercises his option to buy 100 shares of Boeing from Sarah at $375. Although Sarah received a $1,700 premium for writing the call option, she also lost $7,500 because she had to sell her stock that is worth $450 for $375.",
