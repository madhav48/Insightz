  "definition": "Casey Murphy has fanned his passion for finance through years of writing about active trading, technical analysis, market commentary, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, futures, options, and forex (FX).\n\nFuture Publishing/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images\n\nThe put-call ratio is an indicator of whether investors as a whole are placing more bets on prices falling or rising. It's a crucial yet underplayed measure of market sentiment, especially compared with better-known metrics like the Cboe's Volatility Index (VIX).\n\nA \"put\" is a right to sell, and a \"call\" is the right to buy an asset at a preset price. If traders are buying more puts than calls, this signals a rise in bearish sentiment. If they are buying more calls than puts, it suggests that they are bullish. While you'll read more about the put-call ratio for the S&P 500 index or the overall market, you can also look at individual put-call ratios for specific securities.\n\nThis widely-watched indicator compares how many put options (bets that prices will fall) are being bought versus call options (bets that prices will rise). When more investors are buying puts than calls, it suggests growing pessimism about the market's direction.\n\nNote that this ratio is different fromput-call parity, which is a principle defining the relationship between the prices of put and call options. Instead, the put-call ratio focuses on trading volume and provides insights into whether traders are positioning themselves bullishly or bearishly in the options market.\n\nYou can think of puts as insurance policies against falling prices, while calls are like tickets to profit from rising prices.\n\nA put-call ratio of 1.0 means that the\u00a0number of buyers of calls is the same as the number of buyers of\u00a0puts. However, this ratio is not the typical \"neutral\" reading of market sentiment because there are usually more investors buying calls than buying puts. So, an average\u00a0put-call ratio of 0.7 for equities is considered a reasonable basis for evaluating sentiment.\n\nHere are two general principles on how to read the ratio:\n\nThe data used to calculate put-call ratios is available through various sources, but most traders use the information found on the Cboe Options Exchange website.\n\nThe put-call ratio is like the market's fear gauge\u2014when it spikes, it tells us investors are getting nervous and seeking protection.\n\nThe put-call ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded call options. This ratio can be calculated for individual stocks, indexes, or even the entire market:\n\nFor example, if traders buy 1,000 put options and 500 call options in a day, the put-call ratio would be 2.0 (1,000/500), signaling notably bearish sentiment. However, the ratio's interpretation requires context\u2014what's considered \"high\" or \"low\" varies across different market conditions.\n\nWhile trading volume (# of contracts traded) is used most often, the ratio can also be used in call vs. putopen interest(or any changes).\n\nExperienced traders tend to review the ratio's trend rather than just the number itself. A steadily rising or falling ratio often precedes significant market turns.\n\nData for the put-call ratio is publicly available from the Cboe on its daily market statistics page.The Cboe and other options exchanges also report daily trading volumes for put and call options across various underlying assets. TheOptions Clearing Corporationprovides this data as well.\n\nSome financial data providers and brokerage platforms also offer put-call ratio data as part of their market analysis tools. Traders can access this information in real-time or on a delayed basis, depending on their subscription level and the specific data service.\n\nThe put-call ratio is often a contrarian indicator, meaning extreme values may signal potential market reversals. However, the best interpretation depends on your trading strategy and market outlook.\n\nTypically, investors compare current ratio\u00a0levels to the average over a given period to gauge recent sentiment. If the put-call ratio has been fluctuating in a tight range and suddenly bumps higher, traders might see this as a sudden increase in bearish sentiment and respond.\n\nOne common mistake is viewing extreme put-call ratios in isolation. Always consider the broader market context and use other metrics before leaping to any conclusions.\n\nMomentum traders may use the put-call ratio to identify and ride existing trends, often with other indicators or chart patterns.\n\nFor example, they might interpret a rising put-call ratio as confirmation of a bearish trend, potentially leading to further downside. Alternatively, a falling put-call ratio could be seen as confirmation of a bullish trend, potentially leading to further upside.\n\nMomentum traders will use the put-call ratio with other technical indicators to confirm trend strength and identify potential entry or exit points.\n\nA ratio of 0.70 is the average\u00a0that's considered a good basis for evaluating sentiment.This level suggests a healthy balance of hedging with a bullish tilt.\n\nContrarian traders often look for extreme values in the put-call ratio to identify potential market turning points where traders are becoming overly bullish or bearish.\n\nThey might interpret a very high put-call ratio (e.g., above 1.5) as a sign of excessive pessimism, potentially indicating an oversold market ready for a bullish reversal. Alternatively, they might see a very low put-call ratio (e.g., below 0.20) as a sign of excessive optimism, potentially indicating an overbought market ready for a bearish reversal.\n\nContrarian traders tend to believe that when sentiment reaches extreme levels, it signals that most traders have already positioned themselves in one direction, leaving limited room for further movement in that direction.\n\nNevertheless, while the put-call ratio can provide valuable insights, it should not be used in isolation. Traders and investors typically combine this indicator with other technical and fundamental analysis tools to make more informed decisions.\n\nNo singleratioor indicator can definitively indicate that the market is at its top or bottom.\u00a0Even the levels of the put-call ratio\u00a0that are considered extreme are not set in stone\u00a0and vary over the years.\n\nThe put-call ratio can help investors gauge market sentiment before the market turns. However, it's important to also consider additional factors that are relevant to the options market and which may influence the interpretation of the ratio:\n\nGenerally, .70 is considered the average ratio on which to base judgements. There are certain rules of thumb (e.g., above 1.50 or below 0.20) that depend on the context and other factors at play. Traders will want to look at the historical path of the put/call ratio for theunderlyingsecurity to see what values are at extreme levels. Take particular note of outlier ratios to determine if the indicator is at an extreme level, suggesting a trading opportunity.\n\nA put-call ratio of 1.3 means the market is more bearish in anticipation of a downturn.\n\nThe put-call ratio and VIX often move in tandem, with simultaneous increases indicating rising market fear. However, divergences can be revealing. A rising put-call ratio with a stableVIXmight signal sector-specific concerns rather than broad market fear.\n\nSometimes, changes in the put-call ratio precede VIX moves, potentially providing early warning of volatility spikes. Analyzing these indicators together offers a more nuanced view of market sentiment and potential future volatility.\n\nThe put-call ratio is very helpful for gauging whether the market outlook is bullish or bearish for a particular security or an index. Low ratio numbers, like 0.2-0.3, suggest that the market sentiment is highly bullish, while reading over 1.2 indicates that the market is becoming too bearish and may be due for a bounce.\n\nThe put\u2014call ratio is an excellent barometer of market sentiment and likely positioning. Contrarian traders may take such readings as the basis for a trade, while a longer-term investor may use extreme levels to pare back or add to existing positions. Studying the historical path of the put-call ratio of a particular security can help isolate areas of extreme sentiment and alert traders to potential reversals amid an ongoing trend.\n\nJohn C.
