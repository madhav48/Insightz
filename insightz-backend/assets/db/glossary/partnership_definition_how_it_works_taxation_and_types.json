  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA partnership is a formal arrangement by two or more parties to manage and operate a business and share its profits.\n\nThere are several types of partnership arrangements. In a general partnership, all partners share liabilities and profits equally. In other types of partnerships, profits may be shared in different percentages or some partners may havelimited liability. Partnerships may also have a \"silent partner,\" in which one party is not involved in the day-to-day operations of the business.\n\nThe type of partnership that business partners choose will depend on how they want to manage day-to-day operations, who is willing to be financially liable for the business, and how they want to pay taxes.\n\nIn a broad sense, a partnership can be any endeavor undertaken jointly by multiple parties. The parties may be governments, nonprofits enterprises, businesses, or private individuals. The goals of a partnership also vary widely.\n\nWithin the narrow sense of a for-profit business undertaken by two or more individuals, there are three main categories of partnership:general partnership, limited partnership, and limited liability partnership.\n\nIn a general partnership, all parties share legal and financial liability equally. The individuals are personally responsible for the debts the partnership takes on. Profits are also shared equally. The specifics of profit sharing should be laid out in writing in a partnership agreement.\n\nWhen drafting a partnership agreement, an expulsion clause should be included, detailing what events are grounds for expelling a partner.\n\nLimited liability partnerships(LLPs) are a common structure for professionals, such as accountants, lawyers, and architects. This arrangement limits partners' personal liability so that, for example, if one partner is sued for malpractice, the assets of other partners are not at risk.\n\nSome law and accounting firms make a further distinction between equity partners and salaried partners. The latter is more senior than associates but does not have an ownership stake. They are generally paid bonuses based on the firm's profits.\n\nLimited partnerships are a hybrid of general partnerships and limited liability partnerships. At least one partner must be a general partner, with full personal liability for the partnership's debts. At least one other is a silent partner whose liability is limited to the amount invested. This silent partner generally does not participate in the management or day-to-day operation of the partnership.\n\nA limited liability limited partnership is a limited partnership that provides a greater shield from liability for its general partners. This is not a common type of partnership.\n\nThere is no federal statute defining partnerships, but the Internal Revenue Code (Chapter 1, Subchapter K) includes detailed rules on their federal tax treatment.\n\nPartnerships are pass-through businesses, meaning the partnership itself does not pay income tax. The tax responsibility passes through to the individual partners, who are not considered employees for tax purposes.\n\nIndividuals in partnerships may receivemore favorable tax treatmentthan if they founded a corporation. This is because corporate profits are taxed, as are the dividends paid to owners or shareholders. The profits from a partnership, on the other hand, are not double-taxed\u00a0in this way.\n\nLike any business structure, a partnership comes with both benefits and drawbacks.\n\nMost sole proprietors do not have the time or resources to run a successful business alone, and the startup stage can be the most time-consuming. A successful partnership can increase the chances that a business will launch successfully byallowing partners to pooltheir resources and abilities.\n\nCreating a partnershipcan also make the day-to-day operations of a business more manageable than they would be if only one person were running things. Partners to benefit from one another's labor, time, and expertise. Moreover, a shrewd partner can also provide additional perspectives and insights that can help the business grow.\n\nThere is, however, risk in joining a partnership. In addition to sharing profits, the partners may also assume responsibility for any losses or debts from the other partners. There is also a higher chance of conflict or mismanagement. When the time comes to exit, it may be harder to reach an agreement about selling the business.\n\nCombine labor and capital to launch\n\nShare management and operations responsibilities\n\nVariety of experiences and new perspectives\n\nAdditional debts or liabilities\n\nRisk disagreement or mismanagement\n\nDifficulty selling or exiting the business\n\nThe basic varieties of partnerships can be found throughout common law jurisdictions, such as the United States, the U.K., and the Commonwealth nations. There are, however, differences in the laws governing them in each jurisdiction.\n\nThe U.S. has no federal statute that defines the various forms of partnership. However, every state except Louisiana has adopted one form or another of theUniform Partnership Act, creating laws that are similar from state to state.The standard version of the act defines the partnership as a separate legal entity from its partners, which is a departure from the previous legal treatment of partnerships.\n\nThe Uniform Partnership Act only applies to general and\u00a0limited liability partnerships\u00a0(LLPs). It does not apply to\u00a0limited partnerships\u00a0(LPs).\n\nOther common law jurisdictions, including England, do not consider partnerships to be independent legal entities.\n\nA partnership is a business structure that involves two or more individuals who agree to a set distribution of ownership, responsibilities, and profits and losses. Unlike the owners of LLCs or corporations, partners are personally held liable for any business debts of the partnership, which means that creditors or other claimants can go after the partners' personal assets. \u00a0Because of this, individuals who wish to form a partnership should be selective when choosing partners.\n\nPartnerships have several benefits. They are often easier to set up than LLCs or corporations and do not involve a formal incorporation process through a government. This has the added benefit of not being subject to the same rules and regulations that apply to corporations and LLCs. Partnerships also tend to be more tax-friendly.\n\nIn limited partnerships (LPs), general partners manage operations of the firm and have full liability. Limited (silent) partners are not involved in day-to-day operations and enjoy limited liability. A limited liability partnership (LLP) is different from an LP. \u00a0In an LLP, partners are not exempt from liability for the debts of the partnership, but they may be exempt from liability for the actions of other partners.\u00a0A limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) combines aspects of LPs and LLPs.\n\nA partnership itself does not pay business taxes. Instead, taxes are passed through to the individual partners to file on their own tax returns, often via aSchedule K.\n\nPartnerships are often best for a group of professionals in the same line of work where each partner has an active role in running the business. These often include medical professionals, lawyers, accountants, consultants, finance & investing, and architects.\n\nA partnership is a legal arrangement that allows two or more people to share responsibility for a business. Those partners share the ownership and profits, but they also share the work, responsibility, and potential losses. Partnerships are often seen as having more favorable tax treatment than corporations. A successful partnership can give a new business more opportunities to succeed, but a poorly-thought out one can cause mismanagement and disagreements.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Choose a Business Structure.\"\n\nUtah Department of Commerce. \"Limited Liability Limited Partnerships.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"U.S. Code, Section 26, Subtitle A, Chapter 1, Subchapter K: Partners and Partnerships.\"\n\nUniform Law Commission. \"Partnership Act.\"\n\nThompson Reuters Practical Law. \"Partnership.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Information for Partnerships.\"",
