  "term": "Hubbert's Peak Theory: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nHubbert\u2019s peak theory is the idea that because oil production is anon-renewable resource, global crude oil production will eventually peak and then go into terminal decline following a roughly bell-shaped curve. Although this model can be applied to many resources, it was developed specifically for oil production.\n\nHubbert's peak theory is based on the work of Marion King Hubbert, a geologist who worked for Shell in the 1950s. It posits that maximum production from individual or global oil reserves will occur towards the middle of the reserve\u2019s life cycle, according to theHubbert curve, which is used byexploration and production (E&P)companies to estimate future production rates.\n\nAfter that, production decline accelerates due to resource depletion and diminishing returns. Accordingly, if new reserves are not brought online faster than extractable reserves are drawn down, the world will eventually reach peak oil\u2014because there is a finite amount of conventional light, sweet crude in the earth\u2019s crust.\n\nAn impending peak in fossil fuel production would obviously have serious implications for the world economy. Increased fuel scarcity and rising energy costs would have a negative impact on virtually every industry and directly increase consumers\u2019 cost of living.\n\nSpikes in world oil prices are often accompanied by economic recessions; a permanent, sustained increase in prices due to along-term decline in available oil reservesmight lead to corresponding economic malaise. It could even raise the specter ofstagflationand decliningstandards of livingworldwide.\n\nBut Hubbert\u2019s predictions that U.S. oil production would peak in the 1970s and that the world would hit peak oil around the year 2000, were proven wrong. In actuality, a technological revolution in the oil business has increasedrecoverable reservesand boosted recovery rates from new and old wells.\n\nThanks to hi-tech digital oil exploration using 3D seismic imaging, which enables scientists to see miles below the seabed floor,proven reservesaround the world are growing all the time, as new oil fields are discovered. Offshore drilling in the 1950s could reach a depth of 5,000 feet. Today, the most advanced offshore oil rigs have the technology to drill up to 50,000 feet.\n\nThe state of Texas has led the U.S. in crude oil production every year but one since 1970. In 1972, the state's annual production rose to slightly more than 1.26 billion barrels. Thanks to innovations likehydraulic fracturing,enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and horizontal drilling, in 2019, annual production increased to more than 1.8 billion barrels. These innovations have added trillions of cubic feet of gas and billions of barrels of oil to America\u2019s recoverable reserves. While the U.S. has become a net exporter of petroleum products (such as distillate fuel, motor gasoline, and jet fuel), it remains a net importer of crude oil.\n\nHi-tech digital oil exploration using 3D seismic imaging has enabled oil companies to discover new oil fields.\n\nThe oil industry no longer talks about running out of oil, thanks to companies likeSchlumberger. For the foreseeable future, there are abundant quantities of oil. According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, the world's total proven oil reserves are estimated to be around 1.73 trillion barrels, as of the end of 2020 (latest information). However, this number is likely to rise because most of the world has yet to be explored using the latest technologies.\n\nNor are we anywhere close to peak energy. There are more than one trillion tons of proven coal reserves worldwide\u2014enough to last around 150 years at current rates of production. There are 188 trillion cubic meters of proven natural gas reserves\u2014enough to last at least 50 years. And there may be three trillion tons of natural gas hydrates, which is enough natural gas to fuel the world for a thousand years, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nThese known and estimated reserves indicate that the peak in fossil fuel production is apparently a long way off in the future. However, given the current understanding of the origin of fossil fuels, it is virtually inescapable that total reserves are a finite resource.\n\nPeak oil represents a future threat, depending on how long it takes us to reach the peak, how rapidly production will decline post-peak, and whether and how fast fossil fuels can be replaced by other energy sources.\u00a0For now, though, Hubbert\u2019s peak theory does not appear to present a significant economic challenge in the near term.\n\nHubbert predicted that crude oil production would peak in the 1970s and decline from that point onwards. At the time of his writing, Hubbert was generally correct, as U.S. oil production did peak at the time; however, Hubbert was not aware of the discovery and production of additional reserves, such as from Alaska, as well as the implementation of new technologies, such as fracking, which has allowed U.S. oil production to increase.\n\nAs of 2022, the United States was the largest producer of crude oil, producing 11.89 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia was the second-largest producer, producing 10.64 million barrels per day.\n\nVenezuela has the largest oil reserves of any country; however, much of that oil is difficult to refine.\n\nThe depletion of fossil fuel resources would have a devastating impact on civilization; however, current proven reserves show a significant amount of fossil fuels available that can be tapped and used.\n\nThe greater concern is the negative impact of fossil fuel use on the climate. Because of this, there have been great strides made to move away from fossil fuels, such as electric vehicles, and the implementation of other renewable energy sources, which, if widely implemented in the future, will remove the concern for the depletion of fossil fuels.\n\nTushar K.
