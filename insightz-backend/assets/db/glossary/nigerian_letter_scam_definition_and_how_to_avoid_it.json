The letter may be sent by mail, fax, or email\u2014the most common method. The author is typically a self-proclaimed government or military official, bank officer, or business executive, who explains they need access to a foreign account to transfer money out of Nigeria.\n\nIn exchange, the sender offers the recipient acommission\u2014sometimes up to several million dollars, depending on the perceived gullibility of the target. The scammers then request money to pay for some of the costs associated with the transfer, such as taxes, legal fees, and bribes to government officials. If the scammers are successful in receiving money, they will either disappear immediately or try to get more money with claims of additional transfer problems.\n\nThis specific type of scam is generally referred to as a Nigerian letter scam because of its prevalence in that country, particularly during the 1990s. Section 419 of the Nigerian Criminal Code makes this type offraudillegal. However, this scam is not limited to Nigeria and is also perpetrated by various organizations in countries around the world.\n\nThe origins of this scam are widely debated with some suggesting it started in Nigeria during the 1970s, while others suggest its origins go back hundreds of years to other confidence scams, such as the Spanish Prisoner scam.\n\nThe Nigerian letter scam was initially conducted by phone, fax, and traditional mail. The proliferation of email provided a new route for the Nigeran scam. Warning signs that a message might be a scam include mention of a U.S. currency account in a foreign country and the promise of substantial compensation for little effort, as well as typos, grammatical errors, and unusual syntax.\n\nNigerian letter scammers hope the commissions they offer will be enticing enough to compel recipients to risk sending thousands of dollars to a stranger. The scammer may say the transfer is needed because the government is trying to freeze (or confiscate) their accounts, or that the money is otherwise hostage to war, corruption, or political unrest. The person might say they desperately need your bank account number to transfer the money for safekeeping.\n\nOf course, when it comes to this type of request, remember that if anything sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Nigerian letter scams continue to exist because it only takes a handful of people\u2014out of hundreds of thousands of attempts\u2014to be fooled to make it worth the scammers' time and effort.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recommends the following tips for avoiding this type of fraud:\n\nThough many people recognize these and other types of scams, remember that criminals only have to find a few gullible people to make their time worthwhile.
