  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nIncome tax is a type of tax governments impose on the income that businesses and individuals generate. By law, taxpayers must file an income tax return annually to determine their tax obligations.\n\nIncome taxes are a source of revenue for governments. They are used to fund public services and pay government obligations. In addition to the federal government, many states and local jurisdictions also levy income taxes.\n\nCertain investments, likehousing authority bonds, are exempt from income taxes in some cases.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collects taxes and enforces tax laws in the United States. The IRS employs a complex set of rules and regulations regarding reportable and taxable income, deductions, credits, etc. The agency collects taxes on all forms of income, such as wages, salaries, commissions, investments, and business earnings.\n\nThe personal income tax that the government collects can help fund government programs and services, such as Social Security, national security, schools, and roads.\n\nThe United States imposed the nation\u2019s first income tax in 1862 to help finance the Civil War. After the war, the tax was repealed, but it was reinstated after the passage of the Revenue Act of 1913. That same year,Form 1040was introduced.\n\nMost countries, including the U.S., employ aprogressive income tax systemin which higher-income earners pay a higher tax rate compared with their lower-income counterparts. The idea behind progressive tax is that those who earn high incomes can afford to pay more tax. For 2023 and 2024,federal income tax ratesrange from\u00a010% to 37%.\n\nIndividual income tax is also referred to as personal income tax. This type of income tax is levied on an individual\u2019s wages, salaries, and other types of income. This tax is usually a tax that the state imposes. Because ofexemptions, deductions, and credits, most individuals do not pay taxes on all of their income.\n\nThe IRS offers a series of income tax deductions and tax credits taxpayers can use to reduce their taxable income. While a\u00a0deduction\u00a0canlower your taxable incomeand the tax\u00a0rate used to calculate your\u00a0tax, a tax credit reduces your income\u00a0tax\u00a0obligation.\n\nThe IRS offers tax deductions for healthcare expenses, investments, and certain education expenses. For example, if a taxpayer earns $100,000 in income and qualifies for $20,000 in deductions, the taxable income reduces to $80,000 ($100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000).\n\nTax creditshelp reduce the taxpayer\u2019s tax obligation or amount owed. They were created primarily for middle-income and lower-income households. To illustrate, if an individual owes $20,000 in taxes but qualifies for $4,500 in credits, their tax obligation reduces to $15,500 ($20,000 - $4,500 = $15,500).\n\nTaxable income is your\u00a0adjusted gross income (AGI)\u00a0minus anyitemized deductionsor yourstandard deduction.\n\nBusinesses also pay income taxes on their earnings; the IRS taxes income from corporations, partnerships, self-employed contractors, and small businesses.\n\nDepending on the business structure, the corporation, its owners, or shareholders report their business income and then deduct their operating and capital expenses. Generally, the difference between theirbusiness incomeand their operating and capital expenses is considered their taxable business income.\n\nAll butnine U.S. statesimpose personal income taxes on their residents. The ones that don't are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that it may not necessarily be cheaper to live in a state that does not levy income taxes. This is because states often make up the lost revenue with other taxes or reduced services.\n\nWhat's more, other factors determine the affordability of living in a state, including healthcare, cost of living, and job opportunities. For instance, Florida residents pay a 6% sales tax on goods and services, while the state sales tax in Tennessee is 7%.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a complicated tax situation, a tax calculator can give you an idea of how much income tax you might owe.\n\nTo further complicate matters,states continually adjust their tax systemsin ways both large and small, making it impossible to predict what sort of tax burden their residents will face in the years to come.\n\nThe percent of your income that is taxed depends on how much you earn and yourfiling status. In theory, the more you earn, the more you pay. The federal income tax rate ranges from 10% to 37%.\n\nTo calculate income tax, you\u2019ll need to add up all sources of taxable income earned in a tax year. The next step iscalculating your adjusted gross income (AGI). Once you have done this, subtract any deductions for which you are eligible from your AGI.\n\nAlaska, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyomingdo not collect state income taxes.\n\nAll taxpayers pay federal income tax. Depending on where you live, you may have to pay state and local income taxes, too. The U.S. has a progressive income tax system, which means that higher-income earners pay a higher tax rate than those with lower incomes. Most taxpayers do not pay taxes on all of their income, thanks to exemptions and deductions.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cHistorical Highlights of the IRS.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Federal Income Tax Rates and Brackets.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCredits and Deductions for Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Definition of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 407 Business Income.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cWhat Is Taxable and Nontaxable Income?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 535, Business Expenses.\" Pages 3-6.\n\nTax Foundation. \"State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets, 2024.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \u201cTaxes in Tennessee.\u201d\n\nTax Foundation. \u201cTaxes in Florida.\u201d",
