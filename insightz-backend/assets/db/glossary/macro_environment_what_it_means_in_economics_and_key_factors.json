  "term": "Macro Environment: What It Means in Economics, and Key Factors",
  "definition": "Macro environment refers to the broad economic conditions and external factors that influence the overall economy.\n\nA macro environment refers to the overall, broader economy and the external forces that affect it. Microenvironment, on the other hand, focuses on a specific sector or region. In general, the macro environment includes trends in the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, employment, spending, and monetary and fiscal policy. The macro-environment is closely linked to the generalbusiness cycleas opposed to the performance of an individual business sector.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nThe macro-environment refers to how the macroeconomic conditions in which a company or sector operates influence its performance.Macroeconomicsdeals with aggregate production, spending, and the price level in an economy as opposed to individual industries and markets.\n\nThe amount of the macro environment's influence depends on how much of a company's business is dependent on the health of the overall economy. Cyclical industries are heavily influenced by the macro environment, while basic staple industries are less influenced. Industries that are highly dependent on credit to finance purchases and business investments are strongly influenced by changes in interest rates and global financial markets.\n\nThe macro-environment can also directly affect consumers\u2019 ability and willingness to spend. Luxury goods industries and big-ticket consumer goods can be highly impacted by fluctuations in consumer spending. Consumers\u2019 reactions to the broad macro-environment are closely monitored by businesses and economists as a gauge for an economy\u2019s health.\n\nAnalyzing the macro environment is an important part of strategic management. Business analysts often conduct a PEST (political, economic, socio-cultural, and technological) analysis to identifymacro-economic factorsthat currently affect or in the future may affect business. Some of the key factors composing the macro environment include the following:\n\nGross Domestic Product(GDP) is a measure of a country\u2019s output and production of goods and services. The Bureau of Economic Analysis releases a quarterly report on GDP growth that provides a broad overview of the output of goods and services across all sectors.An especially influential aspect of GDP is corporate profits for the economy, which is another measure of an economy\u2019s comprehensive productivity.\n\nInflationis a key factor watched by economists, investors, and consumers. It affects the purchasing power of the US dollar and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. The target rate for annual inflation from the Federal Reserve is 2%. Inflation higher than 2% significantly diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar, making each unit less valuable as inflation rises.\n\nEmployment levels in the United States are measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases a monthly report on business payrolls and the status of theunemploymentrate.The Federal Reserve also seeks to regulate employment levels through monetary policy stimulus and credit measures. These policies can ease borrowing rates for businesses to help improve capital spending and business growth, resulting in employment growth.\n\nConsumer spending made up 54% of the U.S. GDP in the second quarter of 2021 and is widely considered to be an important indicator of macroeconomic performance.Slow growth or decline in consumer spending suggests a decline in aggregate demand, which economists consider to be a symptom or even a cause of macroeconomic downturns and recessions.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy initiatives are a key factor influencing the macro environment in the United States. Monetary policy measures are typically centered around interest rates and access to credit. Federal interest rate limits are one of the main levers of the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy tools. The Federal Reserve sets a federal funds rate for which federal banks borrow from each other, and this rate is used as a base rate for all credit rates in the broader market. The tightening of monetary policy indicates rates are rising, making borrowing more costly and less affordable.\n\nFiscal policyrefers to government policy around taxation, borrowing, and spending. High tax rates can reduce individual and business incentives to work, invest, and save. The size of a government\u2019s annual deficits and total debt can influence market expectations regarding future tax rates, inflation, and overall macroeconomic stability. Government spending drives borrowing and taxation; it is also widely used as a policy tool to try to stimulate economic activity during slow times and make up for sluggish, consumer spending and business investment during recessions.\n\nThe micro environment refers to the factors within a company that impact its ability to do business. Micro environmental factors are specific to a company and can influence the operation of a company and management's ability to meet the goals of the business. Examples of these factors include the company's suppliers, resellers, customers, and competition.\n\nThe micro environment is specific to a business or the immediate location or sector in which it operates. In contrast, the macro environment refers to broader factors that can affect a business. Examples of these factors includedemographic, ecological, political, economic, socio-cultural, and technological factors.\n\nMacro environment analysis is part of a company'sstrategic managementthat enables it to analyze and identify potential opportunities and hazards that might impact the business. The goal is to prepare management in advance with information that assists them in making operational decisions.\n\nSome companies will employ analysts trained to evaluate macro-environmental factors and provide recommendations based on their research. These analysts will review broad macro-environmental forces related to such factors as politics, the economy, demographics, and technology.\n\nPolitical factors are an example of a macro-environmental force that can impact a business. These include laws or government regulations governing companies or the industry in which they operate.\n\nFor example, a government can enacttariffsthat increase the cost of an imported good that a company needs to manufacture its products. Rather than paying the tariff, the company can look for a domestic source for these goods that is cheaper than the imported goods. If they can't find a domestic source, they will have to purchase the more expensive imported goods. In many cases, the company will need to pass the additional cost on to the consumer in the form of increased product prices. This could reduce the company's revenue if sales decrease because of the company's higher prices.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"Gross Domestic Product.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"U.S. Economy at a Glance.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Why does the Federal Reserve aim for inflation of 2 percent over the longer run?\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Local Area Unemployment Statistics: Unemployment Rates for States.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Current Employment Statistics - CES (National).\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Real GDP and Its Components, Quarterly, Seasonally Adjusted.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communications: 2019-2020 Review: Overview.\"",
