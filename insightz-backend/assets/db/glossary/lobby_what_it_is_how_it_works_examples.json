  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nThe term \"lobby\"\u00a0refers to a\u00a0group of people who band together and try to influence politicians and other individuals in public office. A lobby is typically formed to influence government officials to act in a way that is beneficial to the lobby's or anindustry'sbest interests,\u00a0either through favorable legislation or by blocking unfavorable measures. The term is also used as a verb to describe the influence that a group of individuals exerts over other people.\n\nThe term \"lobby\" came into use in the American political landscape in the 1800s in U.S. state houses in the Northeast. The very first lobby in the United StatesCongresswas the room outside the chamber, which was one of the easiest places to run into House Representatives. This was generally where people were able to meet with politicians, have their say, and try to persuade them to vote a certain way.\n\nThe term's meaning began to shift as people gave up meeting in this physical lobby. As mentioned above, a lobby is a group of individuals or companies that use their influence over public officials. It also means the action of trying to exert influence over other individuals.\n\nLobbyists are particularly active and well-funded by certain industries, notably pharmaceuticals,oil and gas,insurance, hospitals and nursing homes,\u00a0utilities,banks, andreal estate.\n\nLobbies and lobbyists are paid substantially by their clients to sway the decisions of lawmakers to pass legislation for the industries they serve. Lobbies are often seen negatively because of the influence they exert and the amount of power they hold. That's why they can circumvent the democratic process and conduct what most people call back-office deals.\n\nIt may not seem fair to the average citizen that an interest group can seemingly buy a vote, butthat is how it\u00a0works in politics. Despite anti-lobbying rhetoric spewed by many candidates on the campaign trail, the candidate, if elected into office, does little or nothing to put an end to special interest money. In fact, these politicians often expose themselves as hypocrites when they accept donations from lobbies.\n\nAlthough they are generally looked down upon, some lobbies can have a positive impact on society, such as those tied to environmental groups, education, and human rights.\n\nLobbyists who walk around Washington D.C. and state capitals may serve a positive role in illuminating or clarifying issues that are germane to industries or professions, but they are generally viewed pejoratively as special interest groups.\n\nPractical-minded people should note that competing interests in a democratic process are natural. Where lines may be drawn, however, are in cases that are considered harmful to society by a majority of Americans.\n\nFor instance, there is a debate about whether\u00a0guns andtobaccofit into this category. The same goes for processed foods, sugary drinks, and expensive drugs. Some do not like the lobbies that push their agendas. Also, if a lobby simply outspends a competing interest to get what it wants, the question of fairness arises.\n\nThere are lobbies, on the other hand, that are seen as positive where the public good is concerned.\u00a0Some of them are even considered essential. These lobbies are tied to environmental groups, education,\u00a0and human rights, to name a few. These lobbies may not be as well-funded as the industries and interest groups that oppose them, but at least they have a voice.\n\nMany citizens liken the actions of lobbies tobriberybecause they may promise politicians financial support and backing during their political campaigns in exchange for votes on legislation.\n\nLobbying can take on a few different forms. The two most common are:\n\nThe National Rifle Association is one of the most well-known lobbies in the United States. The organization was founded in 1871. The organization had roots in the promotion of shooting sports and hunting. Over time, it expanded and became an advocacy group for gun owners around the country.\n\nThe NRA calls itself a \"major political force\" whose effectiveness is due to several factors, including:\n\nThe organization committed about $2.3 million to its lobbying efforts in 2023.\n\nFor example, an oil company has found an oil well on land that is soon to be protected for environmental purposes through new legislation, which would prevent the oil company from drilling for oil. This new oil well could significantly boost the oil company's profits. The oil company lobbies politicians, through various communications, donations, and other methods, to change the upcoming legislation. When the time comes, the lobbying has influenced enough politicians, who decide against protecting the land the oil well is on, thereby allowing the oil company to drill for oil.\n\nWhether lobbying is ethical or unethical will depend on an individual's opinion. It is seen as part of the democratic process in the U.S., and to prevent abuse of the process, rules have been placed around lobbying.\n\nLobbying generally works when a group with a specific interest hires professional advocates, most often lawyers, especially those who are well-connected in the government, to influence legislation in Congress that will benefit the group.\n\nA lobby is a group that seeks to influence politicians to make decisions in its favor, usually through legislation. Lobbying can have positive effects, such as through advocacy forenvironmentaland human rights causes; however, it is often seen as a way for special interests to exert undue influence.\n\nUnited States House of Representatives. \"Lobbying in the Lobby.\"\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures. \"How States Define Lobbying and Lobbyist.\"\n\nOpen Secrets. \"Lobbying: Industries.\"\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"26 CFR \u00a7 56.4911-2 - Lobbying Expenditures, Direct Lobbying Communications, and Grass Roots Lobbying Communications.\"\n\nNational Rifle Association. \"A Brief History of the NRA.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Justice. \"Effect of the NRA (National Rifle Association) As a Citizens Special Interest Group Concerned With the Criminal Justice System.\"\n\nOpen Secrets. \"Client Profile: National Rifle Assn: Summary.\" Select \"2023.\"",
