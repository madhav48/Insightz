  "term": "Rate of Return (RoR): Meaning, Formula, and Examples",
  "definition": "A rate of return (RoR) indicates how much an investment\u2019s value has changed over time relative to what it cost.\n\nAn investment\u2019s rate of return (RoR) is a measurement of how much it has gained or decreased in value when it's purchased at one point and produces cash flow in the future. You\u2019re determining the percentage change from the beginning of the period until the end. It can be applied to any asset from stocks and bonds to fine art.\n\nA rate of return (RoR) can be applied to any investment vehicle, from real estate to bonds to stocks tofine art. The RoR works with anyasset, provided the asset is purchased at one point in time and produces cash flow at some point in the future. Investments are assessed based, in part, on past rates of return, which can be compared against assets of the same type to determine which investments are the most attractive. Many investors like to pick arequired rate of returnbefore making an investment choice.\n\nThe formula to calculate the rate of return (RoR) is:\n\nRate\u00a0of\u00a0return=[(Current\u00a0value\u2212Initial\u00a0value)Initial\u00a0value]\u00d7100\\text{Rate of return} = [\\frac{(\\text{Current value} - \\text{Initial value})}{\\text{Initial value}}]\\times 100Rate\u00a0of\u00a0return=[Initial\u00a0value(Current\u00a0value\u2212Initial\u00a0value)\u200b]\u00d7100\n\nThis simple rate of return is sometimes called the basicgrowth rateorreturn on investment (ROI). If you also consider the effect of the time value of money and inflation, the real rate of return can also be defined as the net amount ofdiscounted cash flows (DCF)received on an investment after adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe average annual rate of return for the total stock market between 2015 and 2025, as measured by the growth of the S&P 500 index. Note that actual returns vary widely from year to year and from stock to stock.\n\nThe rate of return calculation for stocks and bondsis slightly different. Assume an investor buys a stock for $60 a share, owns the stock for five years, and earns a total amount of $10 individends. If the investor sells the stock for $80, their per-share gain is $80 - $60 = $20. In addition, they have earned $10 in dividend income for a total gain of $20 + $10 = $30. The rate of return for the stock is thus a $30 gain per share, divided by the $60 cost per share, or 50%.\n\nOn the other hand, consider an investor who pays $1,000 for a $1,000 par value 5%coupon bond. The investment earns $50 in interest income per year. If the investor sells the bond for $1,100 in premium value and earns $100 in total interest, the investor\u2019s rate of return is the $100 gain on the sale, plus $100 interest income divided by the $1,000 initial cost, or 20%.\n\nThe simple rate of return is considered anominal rate\u00a0of returnsince it does not account for the effect of inflation over time.Inflationreduces the purchasing power of money so $1,000 six years from now is not the same as $1,000 today.\n\nDiscounting is one way to account for the time value of money. Once the effect of inflation is taken into account, we call that thereal rate of return(or the inflation-adjusted rate of return).\n\nA closely related concept to the simple rate of return is thecompound annual growth rate (CAGR). The CAGR is the mean annual rate of return of an investment over a specified period longer than one year, which means the calculation must factor in growth over multiple periods.\n\nTo calculate the compound annual growth rate, we divide the value of an investment at the end of the period in question by its value at the beginning of that period; raise the result to the power of one divided by the number of holding periods, such as years; and subtract one from the subsequent result.\n\nThe rate of return can be calculated for any investment, dealing with any kind of asset. Let's take the example of purchasing a home as a basic example for understanding how to calculate the RoR. Say that you buy a house for $250,000 (for simplicity, let's assume you pay 100% cash).\n\nSix years later, you decide to sell the house\u2014maybe your family is growing and you need to move into a larger place. You're able to sell the house for $335,000, after deducting any realtor's fees and taxes. The simple rate of return on the purchase and sale of the house is as follows:\n\n(335,000\u2212250,000)250,000\u00d7100=34%\\frac{(335,000-250,000)}{250,000} \\times 100 = 34\\%250,000(335,000\u2212250,000)\u200b\u00d7100=34%\n\nNow, what if, instead, you sold the house for less than you paid for it\u2014say, for $187,500?The same equation can be used to calculate your loss, or the negative rate of return, on the transaction:\n\n(187,500\u2212250,000)250,000\u00d7100=\u221225%\\frac{(187,500 - 250,000)}{250,000} \\times 100 = -25\\%250,000(187,500\u2212250,000)\u200b\u00d7100=\u221225%\n\nThe next step in understanding RoR over time is to account for thetime value of money (TVM), which the CAGR ignores. Discounted cash flows take the earnings of an investment and discount each of the cash flows based on adiscount rate. The discount rate represents a minimum rate of return acceptable to the investor, or an assumed rate of inflation. In addition to investors, businesses use discounted cash flows to assess the profitability of their investments.\n\nAssume, for example, a company is considering the purchase of a new piece of equipment for $10,000, and the firm uses a discount rate of 5%. After a $10,000 cash outflow, the equipment is used in the operations of the business and increases cash inflows by $2,000 a year for five years. The business applies present value table factors to the $10,000 outflow and to the $2,000 inflow each year for five years.\n\nThe $2,000 inflow in year five would be discounted using the discount rate of 5% for five years. If the sum of all the adjusted cash inflows and outflows is greater than zero, the investment is profitable.A positivenet cashinflow also means that the rate of return is higher than the 5% discount rate.\n\nThe rate of return using discounted cash flows is also known as theinternal rate of return (IRR). Theinternal rate of returnis a discount rate\u00a0that makes thenet present value (NPV)of all cash flows from a particular project or investment equal to zero. IRR calculations rely on the same formula as NPV does and utilize the time value of money (using interest rates). The formula for IRR is as follows:\n\nIRR=NPV=\u2211t=1TCt(1+r)t\u2212C0=0where:T=total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0periodst=time\u00a0periodCt=net\u00a0cash\u00a0inflow-outflows\u00a0during\u00a0a\u00a0single\u00a0periodtC0=baseline\u00a0cash\u00a0inflow-outflowsr=discount\u00a0rate\\begin{aligned} &IRR = NPV = \\sum_{t = 1}^T \\frac{C_t}{(1+ r)^t} - C_0 = 0 \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &T=\\text{total number of time periods}\\\\ &t = \\text{time period}\\\\ &C_t = \\text{net cash inflow-outflows during a single period }t \\\\ &C_0 = \\text{baseline cash inflow-outflows}\\\\ &r = \\text{discount rate}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bIRR=NPV=t=1\u2211T\u200b(1+r)tCt\u200b\u200b\u2212C0\u200b=0where:T=total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0time\u00a0periodst=time\u00a0periodCt\u200b=net\u00a0cash\u00a0inflow-outflows\u00a0during\u00a0a\u00a0single\u00a0periodtC0\u200b=baseline\u00a0cash\u00a0inflow-outflowsr=discount\u00a0rate\u200b\n\nThe Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) are good alternatives to the Rate of Return (RoR). IRR is the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero. CAGR refers to the annual growth rate of an investment, taking into account the effect of compound interest.\n\nThe rate of return disregards some key factors in an investment, like the time value of money, the timing and size of cash flows, and the risk and uncertainty associated with any investment.\n\nA good return on investment is generally considered to be about 7% per year, which is also the average annual return of the S&P 500, adjusting for inflation.\n\nThe rate of return (ROR) is a simple metric that shows the net gain or loss of an investment or project over a set period. The RoR is expressed as a percentage of the initial value.\n\nThe internal rate of return (IRR) also measures the performance of investments or projects, but while ROR shows the total growth since the start of the project, IRR shows the annual growth rate. The Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) is another metric that shows the annual growth rate of an investment, but this time taking into account the effect of compound interest.",
