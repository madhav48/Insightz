  "definition": "Investopedia / Madelyn Goodnight\n\nA company's enterprise value-to-sales (EV/Sales) ratio indicates whether its stock is overpriced or underpriced by comparing its potential takeover value to its recent sales numbers.\n\nEnterprise value-to-sales (EV/sales) is a ratio that compares theenterprise value(EV) of a company to its annual sales. That is, it compares the company's potential takeover price to its total sales for the year.\n\nThe EV/sales multiple gives investors one way to determine whether a company's stock is overvalued or undervalued. A lower multiple suggests that the company's stock may be cheaper than its financial performance suggests it should be.\n\ninvestors a quantifiable metric of how to value a company based on its sales while taking account of the company's equity and debt.\n\n\ufeffEV/Sales=MC+D\u2212CCAnnual\u00a0Saleswhere:MC=Market\u00a0capitalizationD=DebtCC=Cash\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0equivalents\\begin{aligned} &\\text{EV/Sales} = \\frac{ \\text{MC} + \\text{D} - \\text{CC} }{ \\text{Annual Sales} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{MC} = \\text{Market capitalization} \\\\ &\\text{D} = \\text{Debt} \\\\ &\\text{CC} = \\text{Cash and cash equivalents} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEV/Sales=Annual\u00a0SalesMC+D\u2212CC\u200bwhere:MC=Market\u00a0capitalizationD=DebtCC=Cash\u00a0and\u00a0cash\u00a0equivalents\u200b\ufeff\n\nEnterprise value-to-sales is calculated by:\n\nA slightly more complicated version of enterprise value with a few more variables is sometimes used. The more complex formula for EV is:\n\n\ufeffEV=MC+D+PS+MI\u2212CCwhere:PS=Preferred\u00a0sharesMI=Minority\u00a0interest\\begin{aligned} &\\text{EV} = \\text{MC} + \\text{D} + \\text{PS} + \\text{MI} - \\text{CC} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{PS} = \\text{Preferred shares} \\\\ &\\text{MI} = \\text{Minority interest} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEV=MC+D+PS+MI\u2212CCwhere:PS=Preferred\u00a0sharesMI=Minority\u00a0interest\u200b\ufeff\n\nEnterprise value-to-sales is an expansion of theprice-to-sales(P/S) valuation, the latter of which uses market capitalization instead of enterprise value. EV/Sales is perceived to be more accurate than P/S, in part, because themarket capitalizationalone does not take a company's debt into account when valuing the company, while enterprise value does.\n\nEV-to-sales multiples are usually found to be between 1x and 3x. Generally, a lower EV/sales multiple will indicate that a company may be more attractive or undervalued in the market. The EV/sales measure can also be negative when the cash balance of the company is greater than the market capitalization and debt structure, signaling that the company can essentially be bought with its own cash.\n\nThe EV-to-sales measure can, however, be slightly deceptive in that a higher multiple is not always a signal of over-valuation. A high EV-to-sales can be a positive sign that investors believe that future sales will greatly increase. A lower EV-to-sales can likewise signal that future sales prospects are not very attractive.\n\nTo make the most out of this metric, compare the EV-to-sales to that of other companies in the same industry, and look deeper into the company you are analyzing.\n\nAssume that a company reports sales for the year of $70 million. The company has $10 million ofshort-term liabilitieson the books and $25 million oflong-term liabilities. It has $90 million worth of assets, with 20% of that in cash. Lastly, the company has 5 million shares ofcommon stock outstandingand the current price of the stock is $25 per share. Using this scenario, the company's enterprise value is:\n\nEV=Market\u00a0Cap\u00a0(5\u00a0Million\u00a0Shares\u00d7$25\u00a0Stock\u00a0Price)+Total\u00a0Debt\u00a0($10\u00a0Million+$25\u00a0Million)\u2212Cash\u00a0($90\u00a0Million\u00d720%)=$125Million+$35Million\u2212$18Million=$142Million\\begin{aligned} \\text{EV} &= \\text{Market Cap (5 Million Shares} \\times \\text{\\$25 Stock Price)} \\\\ &\\quad + \\text{Total Debt (\\$10 Million} + \\text{\\$25 Million)} \\\\ &\\quad - \\text{Cash (\\$90 Million} \\times 20\\%) \\\\ &= \\$125 \\text{ Million} + \\$35 \\text{ Million} - \\$18 \\text{ Million} \\\\ &= \\$142 \\text{ Million} \\end{aligned}EV\u200b=Market\u00a0Cap\u00a0(5\u00a0Million\u00a0Shares\u00d7$25\u00a0Stock\u00a0Price)+Total\u00a0Debt\u00a0($10\u00a0Million+$25\u00a0Million)\u2212Cash\u00a0($90\u00a0Million\u00d720%)=$125Million+$35Million\u2212$18Million=$142Million\u200b\n\nNext, to find the EV-to-sales, simply divide the calculated enterprise value by sales. In this example, the EV-to-sales is:\n\nEV/Sales=$142Million$70Million=2.03\\begin{aligned} &\\text{EV/Sales} = \\frac{ \\$142 \\text{ Million} }{ \\$70 \\text{ Million} } = 2.03 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEV/Sales=$70Million$142Million\u200b=2.03\u200b\n\nTaking the EV/sales ratio a step further, consider Coca-Cola. The company has a market cap of $237 billion as of Dec. 31, 2019.\n\nThe EV-to-sales ratio takes into account the debt and cash a company has. The price-to-sales ratio, meanwhile, does not. The price-to-sales ratio is quicker to calculate, using only a company\u2019s market cap as the numerator. However, debtholders do have a claim on sales and should theoretically be included in the valuation.\n\nThe EV/sales ratio requires calculating the enterprise value, which involves a little more digging into financial statements. EV is generally used for valuing acquisitions, where the acquirer will assume the debt of the company, but also get the cash. Another limitation to be aware of is that sales do not take into account a company\u2019s expenses or taxes.",
