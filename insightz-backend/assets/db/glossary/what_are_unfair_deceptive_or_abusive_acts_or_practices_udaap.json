As such, it is responsible for investigating complaints, enforcing regulations, and taking any action against entities that violate the law. This includes issuing fines and penalties and prosecuting offending service providers.\n\nYou can review the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's definition of UDAAP on itswebsite.
