  "definition": "Big data is stored electronically\u00a0and analyzed using software specifically designed to handle complex data sets.\n\nThe term \"big data\" encompasses the volume of information, the speed at which it is created and collected, and the scope of the data to provide the raw material used indata mining. Technology companies like Alphabet and Meta use big data for tasks, such as generating advertising revenue through targeted ads on social media platforms and websites.\n\nBig data is structured or unstructured. Structured data is commonly numeric information easily accessed from databases and spreadsheets. Unstructured data can be more qualitative and unorganized. According to IBM, examples of unstructured data may include \"text, mobile activity, social media posts, andInternet of Things (IoT)sensor data.\"Semi-structured data has characteristics of both structured and unstructured data.\n\nBig data is collected through questionnaires, product purchases on websites or atpoint-of-sale (POS)terminals, electronic check-ins, personal devices, and apps. While beneficial for multiple uses, big data collection raises privacy concerns and the potential vulnerability tocyber attacksanddata breaches.\n\nBig data is typically stored electronically in what are sometimes referred to asdata warehousesor data lakes. It is analyzed using software that handles large data sets. Manysoftware-as-a-service (SaaS)companies specialize in managing this type of complex data.\n\nData mining is a process that analyzes relevant trends and patterns, transforming big data into useful information.\n\nThe \"V's of Big Data\" help define how this type of information differs from other data. Big data is a largevolumeof information collected quickly with highvelocity. It consists of avarietyof reliable information with provenveracityand providesvalueto corporate entities.Common uses include:\n\nThe \"cloud\" refers to networks of data servers where organizations or individuals can rent space to store large volumes of data.Cloud servicessuch as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, and Alphabet's Google Cloud are common choices.\n\nPredictive analytics refers to the collection and analysis of current and historical data to develop and refine models for forecasting future outcomes.Predictive analyticsis widely used in business and finance as well as in fields such as weather forecasting, and it relies heavily on big data.\n\nA data warehouse refers to the place where a business or other organization stores its big data for analysis. A data warehouse can reside in the owner's in-house servers, with an outside specialist company, or in thecloud, and is most commonly associated with structured data. A data lake is a term for repositories that accommodate structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.\n\nArtificial intelligence can analyze big data. Big data can also be used to trainartificial intelligenceto make it more effective.\n\nBig data is the vast, complex data sets that traditional data management systems cannot handle. Big data can help organizations create new strategies and make better corporate decisions when big data is collected and managed properly.\n\nIBM. \"Structured vs. Unstructured Data.\"\n\nSAS Institute Inc. \"Big Data, What It Is and Why It Matters.\"",
