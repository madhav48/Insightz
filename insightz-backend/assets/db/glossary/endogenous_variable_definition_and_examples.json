  "term": "Endogenous Variable: Definition and Examples",
  "definition": "An endogenous variable is one whose value is influenced or determined by other variables within the same statistical model. In other words, an endogenous variable is synonymous with a dependent variable, meaning itcorrelateswith other factors within the system being studied. Endogenous variables are the opposite of exogenous variables, which are independent variables or outside forces.\n\nEndogenous variables are important ineconometricsand economic modeling because they show whether a variable causes a particular effect. Economists employ causal modeling to explain outcomes by analyzing dependent variables based on a variety of factors. For example, in a model studyingsupply and demand, the price of a good is an endogenous factor because the price can be changed by the producer (supplier) in response toconsumer demand.\n\nEconomists also include independent variables to help determine to which extent a result can be attributed to an exogenous or endogenous cause. Endogenous variables have values that shift as part of a functional relationship between other variables within the model. The relationship is also referred to as dependent and is seen as predictable in nature.\n\nThe variables typically correlate in such a way that a movement in one variable should result in a move in the other variable. In other words, the variables should correlate with each other. However, they don\u2019t necessarily need to move in the same direction, meaning a rise in one factor could cause a fall in another. As long as the change in the variables is correlating, it\u2019s considered endogenous\u2014regardless of whether it\u2019s a positive or negative correlation.\n\nAlthough endogenous variables are the dependent variables that correlate with each other, knowing to what extent exogenous variables impact a model is important to consider.\n\nOutside ofeconomics, other fields that use models with endogenous variables include meteorology and agriculture. Sometimes, the relationship in these models is only endogenous in one direction. For example, while pleasant weather may lead to a higher rate of tourism, higher tourism rates do not affect the weather.\n\nIn contrast to endogenous variables, exogenous variables are considered independent. In other words, one variable within the formula doesn\u2019t dictate or directly correlate to a change in another. Exogenous variables have no direct or formulaic relationship. For example, personalincomeand color preference, rainfall andgas prices, and education obtained and favorite flower would all be considered exogenous factors.\n\nFor example, assume a model is examining the relationship between employee commute times and fuel consumption. As the commute time rises within the model, fuel consumption also increases. The relationship makes sense since the longer a person\u2019s commute, the more fuel it takes to reach the destination. For example, a 30-mile commute requires more fuel than a 20-mile commute. Other relationships that may be endogenous include:\n\nEndogenous variables show whether a variable causes a particular effect. That makes them important in econometrics and economic modeling.\n\nAgriculture and meteorology are among the other fields that use models with endogenous variables.\n\nUnlike endogenous variables, exogenous variables are considered independent. One variable within the formula doesn\u2019t dictate or directly correlate to a change in another.\n\nAn endogenous variable is a variable in a statistical model. It\u2019s changed or determined by its relationship with other variables within the model.\n\nTo put it another way, an endogenous variable is synonymous with a dependent variable, meaning it correlates with other factors within the system being studied. Therefore, its values may be determined by other variables.",
