  "term": "What Are Deficits? Definition, Types, Risks, and Benefits",
  "definition": "In financial terms, a deficit occurs when expenses exceed revenues, imports exceed exports, or liabilities exceed assets. A deficit is synonymous with a shortfall or loss and is the opposite of a surplus. A deficit can occur when a government, company, or person spends more than it receives in a given period, usually a year.\n\nWhether the situation is personal, corporate, or governmental, running a deficit will reduce any current surplus or add to any existing debt load. For that reason, many people believe deficits are unsustainable over the long term.\n\nOn the other hand, the famous\u00a0British economistJohn Maynard Keynesmaintained thatfiscal deficitsallow governments to purchase goods and services that can help stimulate their economy\u2014making deficits a useful tool for bringing nations out of recessions.\n\nProponents of trade deficits say they allow countries to obtain more goods than they produce\u2014at least for a period of time\u2014and can also spur their domestic industries to become more competitive globally.\n\nHowever, opponents of trade deficits argue that they provide jobs to foreign countries instead of creating them at home, hurting the domestic\u00a0economy and its citizens. Also, many argue that governments should not incur fiscal deficits regularly because the cost ofservicing the\u00a0debtuses up resources that the government might deploy in more productive ways, such as providing education, housing, or public infrastructure.\n\nThe two primary types of deficits a nation can incur are budget deficits and trade deficits.\n\nAbudget deficitoccurs when a government spends more in a given year than it collects in revenues, such as taxes. For example, if a government takes in $10 billion in revenue in a particular year and its expenditures for the same year are $12 billion, it is running a deficit of $2 billion. That deficit, added to those from previous years,\u00a0constitutes the country'snational debt.\n\nAtrade deficitexists when the value of a nation\u2019s imports exceeds thevalue of its exports.For example, if a country imports $3 billion in goods\u00a0but only exports $2 billion worth, it has a trade deficit of $1 billion for that year. In effect, more money is leaving the country than is coming in, which can cause a drop\u00a0in the value of its currency as well as a reduction in jobs.\n\nAlong with trade and budget deficits, these are some other deficit-related terms you may encounter:\n\nDeficits are not always unintentional or a sign of a government or business in financial trouble. Businessesmay deliberately run budget deficitsto maximize future earnings opportunities, such as retaining employees during slow months to ensure an adequate workforce in busier times. Some governments also run deficits to finance large public projects or maintain programs for their citizens.\n\nDuring a recession, a government may\u00a0run a deficit intentionally by\u00a0decreasing its sources of revenue, such as\u00a0taxes, while maintaining or even increasing expenditures\u2014on infrastructure, for example\u2014to\u00a0provide jobs and income. The theory is that these measures will boost the public's purchasing power and ultimately stimulate the economy.\n\nBut deficits also carry risks. For governments, the adverse effects\u00a0of running a deficit can include lowereconomic growth ratesor thedevaluationof the domestic currency. In the corporate world, running a deficit for too long a period can reduce the company's share value or even put it out of business.\n\nIn September 2024, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the federal budget deficit stood at $1.9 trillion, $373 billion more than the deficit for the same period the previous year.\n\nRegarding the national debt, the CBO projected that as of the end of 2024, federal debt held by the public (as opposed to the government itself) would reach 99% of GDP.The CBO also projected that debt will continue to climb, hitting 101.6% of GDP in 2025 and 122.4% in 2034.\n\nIn a government, a deficit is an amount of spending that exceeds the amount of revenue or income.\n\nThere are many types of deficits, but regarding governments, there are budget and trade deficits.\n\nWhen a government runs a deficit, it spends more than it collects. This isn't always bad, but continuously running a deficit is believed to have adverse consequences. Businesses sometimes intentionally run deficits in their financial strategies but eventually will need to turn deficits into surpluses.\n\nA deficit occurs any time expenses exceed income. For personal finance, it's important to manage your financial deficits, ideally spending within your means and saving your money. Similarly, large government deficits aren't ideal but are sometimes necessary to fund government programs or public infrastructure.\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \"Monthly Budget Review: August 2024.\"\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \"An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook: 2024 to 2034.\"\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \"An Update to the Budget Outlook: 2023 to 2033.\"",
