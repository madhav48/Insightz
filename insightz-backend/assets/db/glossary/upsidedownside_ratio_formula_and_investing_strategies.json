The upside/downside ratio is an effective way to help traders quickly get a feel for potential trends or the reversal of existing trends.\n\nThe upside/downside ratio is often smoothed using a simplemoving averageto filter out smaller, less significant movements. The indicator generates values greater than 1 when thevolumeon advancing issues is greater than declining issues.\u00a0It generates\u00a0values less than 1 when the volume on the declining issues is greater than advancing issues.\n\nThe upside/downside ratio, also known as the up/down volume ratio, is available as a technical indicator on many trading platforms.\n\nThe upside/downside ratio is often used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions in the market. Low values can indicate that the market is reachingoversoldlevels, while high values can indicate that the market is becoming overbought.\n\nAs an example, if the indicator has a value of less than 1, traders could look for buyentry pointsin securities that are approaching significantsupport levels, such as stocks nearing their long-term trendlines.\n\nMomentum traders, who trade in the direction of the prevailingtrend, often use the upside/downside ratio to confirm the broader market has support from institutional investors. Traders may decide to use the indicator as a trade entry filter. For instance, they may only buy astockwhen the indicator is above 1.5, or take a short position when it is below 0.5.\n\nTraders should use other technical indicators in conjunction with the upside/downside ratio when building a trading strategy.\n\nOther technical indicators, such as therelative strength index(RSI) and stochastic oscillator, could be used with the upside/downside ratio to ensure the market is not in an extreme overbought or oversold condition and due for a price correction.\n\nFor example, if the indicator has a value less than 0.5 and the RSI is below 30, it may be prudent to avoid entering ashort positionuntil a short-term retracement occurs.",
