  "definition": "Qualified charitable organizations arenonprofit organizations that qualify for tax-exempt status, according to theInternal Revenue Service (IRS). They must be operated exclusively for one of the following purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational, testing for public safety, the prevention of cruelty to animals or children, or the development of amateur sports. In the United States, a qualified charitable organization is known as a501(c)(3) organization, referring to the portion of theInternal Revenue Code (IRC)that deals with the tax treatment of nonprofits.\n\nOnly donations that are made to a qualified charitable organization are tax deductible.Organizations that do not qualify for this status are considered for-profitand are taxed accordingly. Political contributions are not tax deductible, for example, because political parties are not charitable institutions. On the other hand, contributions to an organization dedicated to building hospitals in underdeveloped countries likely would be a charitable organization, and contributions would be tax deductible.\n\nQualified charitable organizations differ from strictly tax-exempt organizations, which do not have to be for a charitable purpose yet are not required to pay taxes.However, qualified charitable organizations are also tax-free.\n\nQualified charitable organizations include charities, philanthropic groups, certain religious and educational organizations, nonprofit veterans\u2019 organizations, fraternal lodge groups, and cemetery and burial companies. Certain legal corporations can also qualify. Even federal, state, and local governments can be considered qualified charitable organizations if the money donated to them is earmarked for charitable causes.\n\nA qualified charitable organization is prohibited from engaging in any sort of political advocacy, including supporting specific candidates or trying to influence legislation.\n\nTo receive the status from the IRS,qualified charitable organizations must meet requirementsunder section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. This means that none of the earnings of the organization can go toward\u00a0any privateshareholderor individual. The organization may not seek\u00a0to influence legislation\u00a0as a substantial part of its actions.\n\nThe organization also cannot engage in any political campaign activity in favor of\u00a0or in opposition to candidates. There are also limits on how much lobbying these organizations may do in the legislative and political arenas. This includes not being allowed to participate, directly or indirectly, in political campaigns for candidates for public office. Furthermore, no contributions can be made on behalf of the organization for a political campaign.\n\nLikewise, no statements can be made on behalf of the organization in favor of or in opposition to a political candidate. Programs that promote voter registration and participation in elections are permitted as long as no bias shows favoritism for one candidate over another.If the organization breaches such rules, it may lose its tax-exempt status.\n\nThere are further requirements for qualified charitable organizations. They cannot operate or be formed for the benefit of private interests. If an organization enters into any excess benefit transactions with someone who has significant influence over it, then the organization could faceexcise taxes.\n\nA qualified charitable organization must be a nonprofit entity that meets the requirements of the U.S. Treasury under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\n\nThe list is expansive and includes organizations operated exclusively for the following purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, literary, educational purposes, testing for public safety, the prevention of cruelty to animals or children, and the development of amateur sports. The various types include charities, philanthropic groups, certain religious and educational organizations, nonprofit veterans\u2019 organizations, fraternal lodge groups, cemetery and burial companies, and certain legal corporations. Federal, state, and local governments can qualify if the donation in question is intended strictly for a charitable cause.\n\nYes. Indeed, not paying taxes is the primary reason to become a qualified charitable organization. However, if the organization violates Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules regarding how it must operate, it can lose its tax-exempt status. If the group does any political advocacy, for example, it would cease to be tax free.\n\nOrganizations in pursuit of philanthropic, nonprofit, or civic activities can qualify as tax-exempt as part of section 501(c)(3) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\n\nOrganizations that qualify as tax-exempt under 501(c)(3) do not pay taxes, and those who donate to such organizations can claim their donations as tax deductions.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cExempt Purposes \u2014 Internal Revenue Code Section 501(c)(3).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cExemption Requirements \u2014 501(c)(3) Organizations.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 526, Charitable Contributions,\u201d Pages 6-7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cExempt Organization Types.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 557, Tax-Exempt Status for Your Organization,\" Pages 69-70.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cThe Restriction of Political Campaign Intervention by Section 501(c)(3) Tax-Exempt Organizations.\u201d",
