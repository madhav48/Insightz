  "definition": "The WM/Reuters benchmark rates are spot and forward exchange rates used as standard rates for portfolio valuation and performance measurement.\n\nWM/Reuters benchmark rates are spot and forwardforeign exchangerates that are used as standard rates for portfoliovaluationand performance measurement. The WM/Reuters Closing Spot Rate service was introduced in 1994 to provide standardforexrates that would enable portfolio valuations to be compared more accurately against each other and financial benchmarks. It eliminates the need to account for currencydifferentials.\n\nThe WM/Reuters benchmark rates are provided by Thomson Reuters which acquired the World Markets Company (WM) rate calculation business from State Street in 2016.\n\nThe original WM/Reuters service provided closing spot rates for 40 currencies a day. The service has since expanded to 155 closing spot currencies that are covered on an hourly basis. WM/Reuters also provides historical data and closing rates forcurrency forwardsandnon-deliverable forwards(NDFs). Rates are provided hourlyintradayfor spot, forward, and NDF rates.\n\nMost major equity and bond index compilers use the WM/Reuters benchmark rates in their calculations but the rates are also used for other purposes such as calculating benchmark rates for the settlement of financialderivatives.\n\nSome banks also provide a service to their clients by providing a guarantee to trade at the WM/Reuters rates.\n\nThe WM/Reuters benchmark rates are determined over a five-minute fix period from two minutes 30 seconds before to two minutes 30 seconds after the time of the fix. This is generally 4 p.m. in London. Bid and offer rates from the order matching system and actualtradesexecuted are captured during this five-minute window.\n\nTrades occur in milliseconds so only a sample is captured rather than every trade. Themedianbid and offer are calculated using valid rates over the fix period and the mid-rate is then calculated from them.\n\nThese rates are important because they're used to value trillions of dollars in investments held bymoney managersandpension funds. The method used to fix the WM/Benchmark rates came under intense scrutiny in 2013 after widespread allegations ofcollusionand rate manipulation by traders surfaced.\n\nThe buyer and seller in a non-deliverable forward (NDF) agree on an amount between the contracted non-deliverable forward rate and the leading spot rate. NDFs are usually settled in cash U.S. dollars.\n\nIntraday trading takes place during normal business hours. The term is effectively interchangeable with day trading. An investor enters and exits a position within trading hours.\n\nInterday trading involves holding on to a position overnight after the markets have closed.\n\nThe WM/Reuters benchmark rates covered 40 currencies a day when Thomson Reuters first acquired the business in 2016. The service has expanded to 155 closing spot currencies that are covered on an hourly basis.\n\nWM/Reuters benchmark rates are used as standard rates for performance measurement and portfolio valuation. Thomas Reuters acquired the rate calculation business in 2016 from State Street and has expanded it to 155 closing spot currencies that it covers on an hourly basis.\n\nThese rates can provide a helpful and powerful trading tool but they came under fire from traders in 2013 with allegations of rate manipulation and collusion.
