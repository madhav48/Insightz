He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a type of business structure that protects its owners from personal risk while offering the flexibility of a small business and the tax advantages of a partnership.\n\nA limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure in the U.S. that protects the assets of its owners from lawsuits and creditors concerned with the company's business debts.\n\nLimited liability companiesare hybrid entities that combine the characteristics of a corporation with those of a partnership or sole proprietorship.\n\nWhile the limited liability feature is similar to that of a corporation, the availability of pass-through taxation to the members of an LLC is a feature of a partnership rather than an LLC.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nLimited liability companies are permitted under state statutes, and the regulations governing them vary from state to state. Generally, LLC owners are called members.\n\nMany states don't restrict ownership, which means that anyone can be a member. That includes individuals, corporations, foreigners, foreign entities, and even other LLCs. Some entities, such as banks and insurance companies, are prohibited from forming LLCs.\n\nAn LLC is a formal business arrangement that requiresarticles of organizationto be filed with the state. An LLC is easierto set upthan a corporation; however, corporations provide more personal liability protection.\n\nLLCs may elect not to pay federal taxes directly. Instead, their profits and losses can be reported on the personal tax returns of the owners. Or, the LLC may choose to be classified as a corporation for tax purposes.\n\nIf fraud is detected or if an LLC fails to meet its legal and reporting requirements, creditors may be able to go after the members.\n\nLLCs should not be confused with anunlimited liability corporation (ULC), which is a corporate structure allowed in certain countries and in some Canadian provinces.\n\nThe wages paid to LLC members are deemed operating expenses and are deducted from the company's revenue.\n\n1.Although the requirements for LLCs vary by state, there are generally some commonalities. The very first thing owners or members must do is to choose a name.\n\n2.Then, articles of organization can be completed and filed with the state toestablish the LLC. This document can provide basic information about the LLC, the names and addresses of the LLC members, the name of the LLC's registered agent, and the statement of purpose for the business.\n\nThe articles of organization are filed with the state in which the LLC is formed, along with a fee paid directly to the state. Paperwork and additional fees must also be submitted at the federal level to obtain anemployer identification number (EIN).\n\n3.An LLCoperating agreementwill lay out the operational and financial decision-making roles and duties of members. It will state just how profits are to be distributed.\n\nIt is the contract between all members of the LLC and provides all details about the LLC's structure and important business functions.\n\nNormally, this internal document remains with the LLC and isn't distributed externally.\n\nA registered agent is a company that an LLC hires to manage the various legal and government correspondence sent to the LLC so that it can be sure to comply with state regulations.\n\nAn LLC may not be a suitable option if the founder's\u00a0ultimate objective\u00a0is to\u00a0launch a publicly traded company.\n\nThe primary difference between a partnership\u00a0and an LLC is that an LLC separates the business assets of the company from the personal assets of the owners, insulating\u00a0the owners from the LLC's debts and liabilities.\n\nBoth LLCs and partnerships are allowed to pass through their profits, along with the responsibility for paying the taxes on them, to their owners. Their losses can be used to offset other income, but only up to the amount invested by a member.\n\nIf the LLC has organized as a partnership, it must fileForm 1065. (If members have elected to be treated as a corporation, Form 1120 is filed).\n\nWith an LLC, a business continuation agreement can be used to ensure the smooth transfer of interests when one of the owners leaves or dies. Without such an agreement in place, the remaining partners must dissolve the LLC and create a new one.\n\nA limited liability company, commonly referred to as an LLC, is a type of business structure commonly used in the U.S. LLCs can be seen as a hybrid structure that combinesfeatures of both a corporation and a partnership. Like a corporation, LLCs provide their owners with limited liability in the event the business fails. But, like a partnership, LLCs pass their profits to members so that they are taxed as part of each member\u2019s personal income.\n\nThe LLC has two main advantages:\n\nExamples of LLCs include The Wonderful Company LLC and Pilot Travel Centers LLC. LLCs can includesole proprietorship LLCs, family LLCs, and member-managed LLCs.\n\nMany physicians' groups are registered as LLCs. This helps protect the individual doctors from personal liability for medical malpractice awards.\n\nYes. In the case of a corporation, profits are first taxed at the corporate level and then taxed a second time once those profits are distributed to the individual shareholders. This double taxation is decried by many businesses and investors.\n\nLimited liability companies, on the other hand, allow the profits to be passed directly to the investors so thatthey are taxed only once, as part of the investors\u2019 personal income.\n\nLLCs are important legal structures for forming a business. Limited liability means that the assets and debts of the business remain separate from the personal assets and debts of the LLC's owners. In most cases, if an LLC goes bankrupt, creditors can only go after the assets of the business and not of the owners.\n\nLLCs also have several other beneficial features, including simplified taxation and a relatively straightforward formation process. This is part of the reason why LLCs are the most common type of business in the U.S.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Limited Liability Company (LLC).\"\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Choose a Business Structure.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 3402, Taxation of Limited Liability Companies.\" Pages 2-3.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"LLC Filing as a Corporation or Partnership.\"",
