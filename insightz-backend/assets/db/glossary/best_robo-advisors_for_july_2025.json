Unlike standard passively managed robo-advisor offerings, Merrill Guided Investing\u2019s portfolios are built and managed using strategic and tactical asset allocations.\u00a0Merrill\u2019s pitch here is that having the human element can add value in terms of investment selection and portfolio construction beyond what a solely rules-based system can achieve.\n\nFrom an educational perspective, the platform offers webinars, investor education videos, and the Morningstar Investing Classroom, which includes free courses on investment topics ranging from stocks and bonds to mutual funds and ETFs.\n\nInvestopedia aims to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews to help readers make the best decisions with their money. To create this list, Investopedia collected 2420 data points from 20 robo-advisor companies, focusing on the factors that are most important to investors. We reviewed each robo-advisor platform for fees, portfolio management services, goal-planning tools, and other key features in order to give each a rating. Investopedia has been helping readers find the best tools and platforms for managing their finances since 1999.\n\nRobo-Advisors provide automated investment planning based on specific algorithms. They simplify the management of an investor's portfolio based on the type of account you have and your investment goals. One of the first things you'll do when establishing an account is provide answers to key questions about your financial goals. Depending on which robo-advisor you choose, options for investing include stocks, bonds, and more.\n\nMost robo-advisors use apassive investingapproach, which can involve basing one's portfolio on an index such as theS&P 500in order to also match the performance of the index. More active approaches and more customization sometimes is possible, but those services typically will cost more.\n\nThose who don't have the time or the confidence to take a close, hands-on approach with their investment portfolios might be a good match for a robo-advisor. Because such a service is automated, one of the benefits is the amount of time it can save account holders. Robo-advisors also might be a good option for those who are new to investing because it provides a way to get started in investing while still learning the best approach.\n\nRobo-advisors also can be a good fit for those who want the convenience of 24/7 access to their accounts. Working with a traditional financial planner does not provide this kind of access.\n\nIf you are considering using a robo-advisor for your investing needs, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with these terms:\n\nProviding readers with unbiased, comprehensive reviews of digital wealth management companies, more commonly known as robo-advisors, is a top priority of Investopedia. We combined our industry research and subject matter expertise to guide the research and weightings for our 2025 robo-advisor rankings. To collect the data, our researchers gathered data points through online research of provider websites. To fill in any gaps, our research team reached out to the individual companies. In some instances, our researchers did much deeper online research to get the information they needed to complete the data collection. The data collection process spanned from April 5, 2025 to April 11, 2025.\n\nWe then developed a quantitative model that scored each company to rate its performance across nine major categories and 60 weighted criteria to find the best robo-advisors. The score for each company\u2019s overall star rating is a weighted average of the criteria:\n\nThrough this all-encompassing data collection and review process, Investopedia has provided you with an unbiased and thorough review of the top robo-advisors.\n\nThe above material and content should not be considered to be a recommendation.
