The cumulative assets from the business, as well as any revenue or expenses, are recorded on thebalance sheetof the parent company. This information is also reported on the income statement of the parent company.\n\nConsolidated financial statements are used when the parent company holds amajority stakeby controlling more than 50% of the subsidiary business. Parent companies that hold more than 20% qualify to use consolidated accounting. If a parent company holds less than a 20% stake, it must useequity method accounting.\n\nIn business, consolidation occurs when two or more businesses combine to form one new entity, with the expectation of increasingmarket shareand profitability and the benefit of combining talent, industry expertise, or technology. Also referred to asamalgamation, consolidation can result in the creation of an entirely new business entity or a subsidiary of a larger firm. This approach may combine competing firms into one cooperative business.\n\nFor example, in 2015, Target Corp. moved to sell the pharmacy portion of its business to CVS Health, a major drugstore chain. As part of the agreement, CVS Health intended to rebrand the pharmacies operating within Target stores, changing the name to MinuteClinic.

This transfers the debt owed from multiple creditors, allowing the consumer to have a single point of payment to pay down the total.\n\nOften,debt consolidationachieves more manageable monthly payments and may result in a lower overall interest rate. For instance, it may wrap a high-interest credit card payment into a more reasonable home equity line of credit (HELOC).\n\nConsolidation is also a technical analysis term referring to security prices oscillating within a corridor and is generally interpreted as market indecisiveness.
