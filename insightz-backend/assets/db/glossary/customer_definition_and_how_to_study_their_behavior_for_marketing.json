Customers are important because they driverevenues. Businesses can neither survive nor thrive without them.\n\nBusinesses compete to attract customers in a variety of ways. They may advertise their products. They may lower prices. Or they may simply develop unique, high-quality products and experiences that their customers love.\n\nBusinesses often honor the adage \u201cthe customer is always right\u201d because happy customers are more likely to repeat their business with companies that meet or exceed their needs. Many companies closely monitor their customer relationships as a result, to gather information about customer behavior and solicit feedback from customers on ways to improve product lines.\n\nCustomers are categorized in many ways. They\u2019re commonly classified as external or internal.\n\nExternal customers are dissociated from business operations and are often the parties who are interested in purchasing the final goods and services produced by a company. Internal customers are individuals or businesses integrated into business operations. They often exist as employees or other functional groups within the company.\n\nCustomers differ from purchasing agents, who use corporate capital to buy wholesale goods for commercial or industrial use.\n\nBusinesses frequently study their customers\u2019 profiles and behaviors to fine-tune theirmarketingapproaches and tailor theirinventoryto attract more customers.\n\nCustomers are often grouped according todemographicssuch as age, race, gender, ethnicity, income level, and location. All these factors can help businesses cultivate a snapshot of the \u201cideal customer\u201d or \u201ccustomer persona.\u201dThis information helps companies deepen existing customer relationships and reach untapped consumer populations to increase traffic.\n\nCustomers are so important to businesses that colleges and universities offer consumer behavior courses that are dedicated to the study of customer behavioral patterns, choices, and idiosyncrasies. These courses focus on why people buy and use goods and services and how those decisions impactcompaniesandeconomies.\n\nUnderstanding customers enables businesses to create effective marketing and advertising campaigns. It helps them deliver products and services that address needs and wants and retain customers for long-term repeat business.\n\nCustomer servicestrives to create positive experiences for customers. It\u2019s key to a successful seller/customer dynamic. Loyalty in the form of favorable online reviews, referrals, and future business can\u00a0be won or lost based on a good or bad customer\u00a0service experience.\n\nCustomer service has evolved to include real-time interactions via instant message chats, texting, and other means of communication.\n\nThe market is saturated with businesses offering the same or similar products and services. What truly distinguishes one from the other is customer service, which has become the basis of competition for many businesses. Customer service is a key element ofSix Sigma, a quality improvement methodology.\n\nThe terms \u201ccustomer\u201d and \u201cconsumer\u201d are nearly synonymous and are often used interchangeably, but there\u2019s a slight difference.Consumersare defined as individuals or businesses that consume or use goods and services. Customers are the economy\u2019s purchasers who buy goods and services. They can exist as consumers or simply as customers.\n\nCustomers can be broken down into 12 types: prospective, window shoppers, determined, promotion-driven, churned, new, impulse, angry, loyal, brand advocates, referred, and international. Churned customers are those on the tail end of a relationship with your company or store but have moved on.\n\nLoyal customersare the best type of customers because they make repeat purchases over the long term. They\u2019re likely to recommend your business to friends, social media connections, and/or business associates.\n\nCustomers most appreciate high-quality products and services as well as low prices, good service, and the opportunity to give feedback that the company acknowledges.\n\nA company\u2019s most valuable asset is its customers. It\u2019s out of business without them. The most successful companies go to great lengths to study and understand customer behaviors and desires so they can address issues that displease buyers and promote the products and services they like.\n\nBMC Software. \u201cInternal vs. External Customers: How Are They Different?\u201d\n\nSemrush. \u201cThe Marketing Funnel: What It Is & How It Works.\u201d\n\nThe Council for Six Sigma Certification. \u201cWhat Is Six Sigma?\u201d\n\nZendesk. \u201c12 Types Of Customers + How to Support Them.\u201d",
