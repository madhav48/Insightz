  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nIRS Publication 463: Travel, Gift, and Car Expenses explains the expenses associated with business activities that an individual taxpayer can deduct to reduce their overall taxable income.\n\nThe document primarily focuses on expenses for sole proprietors reporting business income on Schedule C. It also applies to Armed Forces reservists, qualified performing artists, fee-basis state or local government officials, and employees with disability impairment-related work expenses who file business expense deductions on Form 2106.\n\nPublication 463 is not necessarily for partnerships, corporations, and trusts. These businesses, though, should refer to the instructions for their required tax forms, along with IRS Publication 535.\n\nPublication 463 does provide some guidance for self-employment expense reporting on Schedule C though Publication 535 is also a central resource. In general, there is some overlap on allowable individual business expense deductions for both employees and the self-employed though they report business expense deductions on two entirely different forms, Schedule A vs. Schedule C.\n\nIRS Publication 463 is published by the U.S.Internal Revenue Service (IRS)and updated periodically on the IRS website. It covers a vast amount of information pertaining to expense deductions.\n\nThe deductions authorized by Publication 463 are fornecessary and ordinary business expensesincurred by an individual taxpayer in the course of doing business. The IRS defines these as expenses that are both common in a particular industry and helpful to the practice of that business.\n\nThese expenses do not have to be required for the conduct of that business. In general, an individual need only determines expenses that were incurred as part of business activity and not expenses associated with personal use.\n\nIRS Publication 463 is divided into six main chapters, which include the following:\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) began to take force for the tax year 2018 and will run through 2025.The TCJA made substantial changes in the area of Schedule A expenses, generally eliminating most Schedule A expense deductions. However, the TCJA integrated a Schedule A standard deduction of $12,000. The $12,000 standard deduction also eliminated the need for most taxpayers to itemize Schedule A deductions of any kind, including business expense deductions at all.\n\nAn individual incurring expenses in the course of their employment will typically obtain the greatest advantage by first seekingreimbursementfrom their employer. This can help to eliminate any need for expense deduction considerations.\n\nPublication 463 addresses expenses for which an employee does not receive reimbursement from an employer. If an employee receives reimbursement for expenses, it is not generally considered taxable income.\n\nIn most cases, travel expenses will be reimbursed by an employer. If travel expenses are not reimbursed, a taxpayer can generally only deduct business travel expenses associated with travel away from their tax home. Some of the most basic expenses that are deductible away from home include transportation, lodging, and meals.\n\nMeals and entertainment are defined separately. In general, any entertainment expenses paid for the purpose of entertainment, amusement, or recreation are nondeductible as a business expense. This includes any expenses for facilities, dues, and memberships.\n\nMeals are generally deductible for up to 50% of the total cost. Meals should not be considered lavish or extravagant. Meals can be expenses at entertainment events if purchased separately.\n\nGifts can generally be deducted as an expense for up to $25 per gift. Gifts of entertainment cannot be deducted.\n\nTaxpayers generally cannot deduct transportation expenses to a regular work location. Some deductions can apply for alternative work locations.\n\nExpenses for a vehicle used for business will generally be calculated using either the standard mileage expensing method or actual cost expensing. The standard mileage method multiplies 58.5 cents per mile usage (for 2022).The actual cost method includes all actual costs such as gas, oil, registration, repairs, and car payments.\n\nW-2employees generally cannot deduct vehicle expenses on a Schedule A. Therefore, alternatively seeking employer reimbursement agreements can be advantageous. Self-employed taxpayers can deduct vehicle expenses from gross income when calculating net income on a Schedule C.\n\nThe IRS suggests that taxpayers keep detailed records of expense deductions.Taxpayers with W-2 wages will report wages on line 1 of the1040form. If a taxpayer has multiple W-2s, the sum of W-2 wages is reported on line 1. Expense deductions associated with W-2 wages can be itemized on a Schedule A if greater than the standard deduction. If Schedule A expense deductions are not greater, the taxpayer gets the standard deduction of $13,850 for tax year 2023; for married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction is $27,700.Schedule A standard or itemized deductions are reported on line 12 of the 1040 and reduce taxable income.\n\nIf a taxpayer is self-employed with1099wages, all 1099 wages are reported on Schedule C.Allowable business expenses pertaining to 1099 income are deducted to arrive at the adjusted gross income which is reported on line 11 of 1040 Form.(For more on Schedule C business expenses, also seePublication 535.)\n\nDisclaimer: Individuals should consult IRS Publication 463 or a tax professional for details pertaining to their own individual business deductions.
