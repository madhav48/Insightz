  "term": "Understanding Purchasing Power and the Consumer Price Index",
  "definition": "Purchasing power refers to how much money you can buy with a unit of currency; essentially, a measure of what your money is worth in terms of goods and services.\n\nPurchasing power describes the amount of products or services that a single unit of money can acquire, reflecting the real-world value of currency in the marketplace. It can weaken over time due toinflation. That's because rising prices effectively decrease the number of goods or services that one unit of money can buy. Purchasing power is also known as a currency's buying power.\n\nIn investment terms, purchasing orbuying poweris the dollar amount of credit available to a customer based on the existingmarginable securitiesin the customer's brokerage account.\n\nPurchasing power affects every aspect of economics, from consumers buying goods\u00a0to investors buying stock\u00a0to a country\u2019s economic prosperity.\n\nInflation reduces a currency's purchasing power. Similarly, loss of purchasing power has the same effect as an increase in prices. To measure purchasing power in the traditional economic sense, you could compare the price of a good or service against a price index such as theConsumer Price Index(CPI).\n\nOne way to understand purchasing power is to imagine that you worked the same job that your grandfather worked 40 years ago. Today, you would need a much higher salary to maintain the same quality of living. By the same token, a homebuyer looking for homes 10 years ago in the $300,000 to $350,000 price range had more and better options to consider than people have now in the same price range.\n\nWhen a currency\u2019s purchasing power decreases due to excessive inflation, serious negative economic consequences can arise. These can include a highercost of living, higher interest rates that affect the global market, andfalling credit ratings. All of these factors can contribute to an economic crisis.\n\nGovernments institute policies and regulations toprotect a currency\u2019s purchasing powerand keep an economy healthy. They also monitor economic data to stay on top of changing conditions. For example, theU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) measures price changes and announces those changes with CPI.\n\nCPI is one of the measures of inflation and purchasing power. It calculates the change in the weighted average of prices of consumer goods and services, and in particular, transportation, food, and medical care, at a given time. CPI can point to changes in the cost of living as well asdeflation.\n\nThe CPI is just one official measure of purchasing power in the U.S.\n\nA concept related to purchasing power ispurchasing power parity(PPP). PPP is an economic theory that estimates the amount by which an itemshould be adjusted for parity, given two countries\u2019 exchange rates. PPP can be used to compare countries\u2019 economic activity, income levels, and other relevant data concerning the cost of living, or possible rates of inflation and deflation.\n\nThe World Bank's International Comparison Program releases data on purchasing power parities between different countries.\n\nPurchasing power loss or gainrefers to the decrease or increase in how much consumers can buy with a given amount of money. Consumers lose purchasing power when prices increase. They gain purchasing power when prices decrease.\n\nCauses of purchasing power loss can include government regulations, inflation, and natural and human-made disasters. Causes of purchasing power gain include deflation and technological innovation.\n\nOne example of purchasing power gain would be if laptop computers that cost $1,000 two years ago cost $500 today. In the absence of inflation, $1,000 will now buy a laptop plus an additional $500 worth of goods.\n\nThe Great Inflation of the 1970s to early 1980s devastated the purchasing power and standard of living of Americans. The rate of inflation skyrocketed to 14%.\n\nHistorical examples of severe inflation andhyperinflation\u2014which can destroy a currency\u2019s purchasing power\u2014show us the various causes and effects of such phenomena. Sometimes, expensive and devastating wars will cause an economic collapse, particularly for\u00a0the losing country. This happened to Germany after World War I (WWI).\n\nIn the aftermath of WWI during the 1920s, Germany experienced extreme economic hardship and almost unprecedented hyperinflation, due in part to the enormous amount of reparations Germany had to pay.\n\nUnable to pay these reparations with the suspect German mark, Germany printed paper notes to buy foreign currencies, resulting in high inflation rates that rendered the German mark valueless, with a nonexistent purchasing power.\n\nThe effects of the loss of purchasing power in the aftermath of the2008 global financial crisisand the European sovereign debt crisis are remembered to this day. Due to increasedglobalizationand the introduction of the euro, currencies are inextricably linked, and economic trouble can cross geographic boundaries. As a result, governments worldwide institute policies to control inflation, protect purchasing power, and prevent recessions.\n\nFor example, in 2008, theU.S. Federal Reservekept interest rates near zero and instituted a plan calledquantitative easing(QE). Quantitative easing, initially controversial, saw the U.S.Federal Reserve System(Fed) buy government and other market securities to increase the money supply and lower interest rates.\n\nThe increase in capital spurred increased lending and created moreliquidity. The U.S. stopped its policy of quantitative easing once the economy stabilized.\n\nTheEuropean Central Bank(ECB) also pursued quantitative easing to help stop deflation in the eurozone after the European sovereign debt crisis and bolster the euro's purchasing power. TheEuropean Economic and Monetary Unionestablished strict regulations in the eurozone related to accurately reporting sovereign debt, inflation, and other financial data.\n\nAs a general rule, countries attempt to keep inflation fixed at a rate of 2%. Moderate levels of inflation are acceptable. High levels of deflation can lead to economic stagnation.\n\nRetirees can be particularly aware of purchasing power loss since many of them live off of a fixed amount of money. They must make sure that their investments earn arate of returnequal to or greater than the rate of inflation so that the value of theirnest eggdoes not decrease each year.\n\nDebt securities and investments with fixed rates of return are the most susceptible to purchasing power risk or inflation. Fixed annuities,certificates of deposit(CDs),\u00a0and Treasury bonds all fall into this category. For instance, a long-term bond with a low fixed rate of return might fail to increase your investment during periods of inflation.\n\nSome investments or investing strategies can helpprotect investors against purchasing power risk. For example,Treasury inflation-protected securities(TIPS) adjust to keep up with rising prices. Commodities such as oil and metals may maintain pricing power during periods of inflation.\n\nPurchasing power refers to how much you can buy with your money. As prices rise, your money can buy less. As prices drop, your money can buy more.\n\nInflation is the gradual rise in the prices of a broad range of products and services. If inflation persists at a high level or gets out of control, it can eat away at purchasing power, what you can buy with the money you have. The same product that cost $2 six months ago might now cost $4 due to inflation. This rise in prices, in turn, can erode people's savings and consequently, their standard of living.\n\nCPI measures the prices of certain consumer goods and services over time to discern changes in prices that indicate inflation. The prices for those goods and services are obtained from American consumers by way of the Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the Census Bureau for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which publishes CPI data.\n\nLong-time investors know that loss of purchasing power can greatly impact their investments. Rising inflation affects purchasing power by decreasing the number of goods or services you can purchase with your money.\n\nInvestors must look for ways to make a return higher than the current rate of inflation. More advanced investors may track international economies for the potential effect on their long-term investments.\n\nThe World Bank. \"International Comparison Program (ICP).\"\n\nFederal Reserve. \"The Great Inflation.\"\n\nSmithsonian Magazine. \"How Hyperinflation Heralded the Fall of German Democracy.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. \"Did Quantitative Easing Work?\"",
