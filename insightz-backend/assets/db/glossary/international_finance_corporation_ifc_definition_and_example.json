  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) provides financing of private-enterprise investment in developing countries around the world, through both loans and direct investments. Affiliated with theWorld Bank, the IFC also provides advisory services to encourage the development of private enterprises in nations that might lack the necessary infrastructure orliquidityfor businesses to secure financing.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation was established in 1956 as a member of the World Bank Group, focused on investing in economic development. It claims to be the largest global development institution focused on theprivate sectorin developing countries. The IFC says it also seeks to ensure that private enterprises in developing nations have access to markets and financing.\n\nThe IFC is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and works in more than 100 countries.These regions include:\n\nThe IFC's stated goals include the development of sustainable agriculture, expanding small businesses' access tomicrofinance, supporting infrastructure improvements, as well as promoting climate, health, and education policies.\n\nTo raise money, the IFC issues bonds in markets around the world. The IFC issued $12.5 billion across 198 bonds in 22 currencies as of 2023.Infiscal year2023, the IFC committed a record $43.7 billion to private companies and financial institutions in developing countries,\n\nThe total amount of fast-track financing to support private companies and developing countries impacted by the economic downturn caused by the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe goal of the IFC is to help people in developing countries create opportunities through its experience, financial resources, innovation, and technical knowledge. According to the organization, its key accomplishments include:\n\nThe IFC also says it reduced 11.5 million tonnes of greenhouse gases from projects in 2023. It also provided 69.7 million people with electricity.\n\nDespite being part of the World Bank Group (acting as its lending arm for the private sector), the IFC faces a great deal of criticism because of its size and influence. Although one of its primary goals is to reducepovertythrough economic development, critics say it acts more like a private investment bank with a focus on corporate profit, sometimes with disregard for the environmental and social impacts of its projects.\n\nAnother key criticism of the group is how it treats investments when it is ready to hand over the reins to locals. The Compliance Advisory Ombudsman says it has handled complaints between 2013 and 2022 that go against the IFC's commitments to its sustainability policy. It also found weaknesses in how the group exits its investments\u2014notably, exiting early in the cases ofdebt financing.\n\nThe IFC announced a partnership with Proparco, a finance development institution from France, and Helios Sports and Entertainment Group in July 2024 to expand sports and entertainment in Africa.\n\nAccording to the IFC, the global sportsmarketwas worth $480.12 billion in 2023 and is poised to rise to $629.81 billion in 2028. The entertainment sector, on the other hand, is expected to jump from $2.1 trillion to $2.9 trillion between 2023 and 2027. Africa's role in these industries is small and poised for growth, given the rise in the region'se-commerce, fashion, and audio-visual content markets.\n\nTogether, these groups stand to help grow economies throughout Africa by supporting jobs\u2014notably in employing youth. The partnership also stands to give a boost to several industries in Africa, including\u00a0tourism,real estate, creative economies, and media.\n\nThe IFC provided $145 million in financing to help one of the world\u2019s largest dairy producers, FrieslandCampina, acquire a controlling stake of 51% of Engro Foods, Pakistan\u2019s leading dairy processor.Although Pakistan is the fourth-largest milk-producing country in the world, demand consistently outpaces supply due to poorinfrastructureand an outdatedsupply chain. Small subsistence farms account for nearly 80% of the industry\u2019s output.\n\nFrieslandCampina has promised to share its experience and best practices with the smaller farmers who supply Engro Foods, along with the majority of the dairy processors in Pakistan. The stated goal is to help these small farmers increaseproductivityand reduce waste.\n\nThe IFC expected 200,000 farmers and 270,000 distributors to benefit from FrieslandCampina'sacquisitionof Engro Foods. In addition, the investment is projected to create 1,000 new jobs in the dairy supply chain.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation is the private sector lending arm of the World Bank Group. Its goal is to provide development and growth opportunities for people in developing countries through the private sector.\n\nThe International Finance Corporation is owned jointly by 186 member countries. These countries work together to come up with the IFC's policies. The board of governors, which is made up of an appointed governor and alternate, delegates the group's powers to its 25-member board of directors.\n\nThe IFC generates revenue by issuing bonds.
