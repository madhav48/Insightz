The milllevyis calculated by determining how much revenue each tax jurisdiction needs for the upcoming year to fund its public services, such as schools, public infrastructure, and parks. This revenue is then divided by the total value of all property within the area, and the combined rates from various jurisdictions create the mill levy for the entire region.\n\nA mill levy is typically imposed by local governments and various taxing authorities, such as school districts, county governments, and cities. Each authority sets a mill rate based on the amount of revenue it needs for the upcoming year.\n\nMost jurisdictions use a percentage formula, which is known as an assessment ratio, to determine the property value for the mill levy.\n\nEach year, the official assessed value of a property is usually set by atax assessorand may be used to set the mill levy. In some cases, a percentage of the market value of the property can be used to set the mill levy instead.\n\nTo determine what the mill levy will be, most jurisdictions use a percentage formula, which is known as an assessment ratio, to determine the property value for the mill levy.\n\nA tax assessor usually sets the assessed value of a property for mill levy purposes. In some cases, a percentage of the market value of the property can be used to set the mill levy.\n\nAs an example, if the entire property value in the area is $1 billion, and the school district needs $100 million in revenue, the county needs $10 million and the city needs $50 million. The tax levy for the school district would be $100 million divided by $1 billion or 0.10. The tax levy for the county would be 0.01 (10 million/1 billion), and the tax levy for the city would be 0.05 (50 million/1 billion).\n\nAdd all the tax levies up, and you get a mill levy of 0.16or160 mills (one mill = 0.001).\n\nIn general, mill levies are applied to real estate, land, buildings, and significant personal property such as cars and boats.\n\nThe mill levy is calculated by dividing the total amount of revenue needed by the total value of all taxable properties in the area. The tax rates from each jurisdiction (school districts, county governments, etc.) are then combined to determine the total mill levy.\n\nYes, mill levies can be applied to personal property such as vehicles, boats, and other significant assets, in addition to real estate properties like land and buildings.\n\nThe mill levy rate can be adjusted annually or as needed, depending on the budget requirements of the local jurisdictions. If a jurisdiction needs more revenue to cover expenses, it may increase the mill levy rate. However, changes are typically subject to public hearings or approval by the local governing body.\n\nThe mill levy is a vital part of property taxation, determining how much property owners must pay for local services like schools, infrastructure, and government operations.
