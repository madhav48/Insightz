  "term": "Statutory Reserves: Definition and Examples",
  "definition": "Statutory reserves are the funds that state insuranceregulatorsrequire the insurance companies operating in their state to maintain at any given time. The purpose of statutory reserves is to help ensure that insurance companies have adequate liquidity available to honor all of the legitimateclaimsmade by their policyholders.\n\nThe McCarran-Ferguson Act, passed by Congress in 1945, gave states the authority to regulateinsurancecompanies. To do business in a state, each insurer must be licensed by the state's insurance department and abide by its rules. Among those rules is how much money an insurer must keep in reserve to make sure that it will be able to pay its future claims.\n\nInsurance companies collectinsurance premiumsfrom their customers and then invest those premiums in theirgeneral accountto generate areturn on investment(ROI). In theory, insurers might be tempted to invest a very large fraction of the premiums they collect in order to maximize their return. However, doing so could leave them with insufficient cash on hand to satisfy the claims made by their customers.\n\nTo prevent this from happening, state insurance regulators enforce minimum levels ofliquiditythat insurance companies must maintain. These statutory reserves can either be held in cash, or inreadily marketable securitiesthat can be converted into cash reliably and on short notice.\n\nStatutory reserves apply to a range of insurance products, includinglife insurance, health insurance, property and casualty insurance, long-term care insurance, andannuity contracts. The requirements can vary from one state to another and according to the type of insurance product.\n\nIn setting the level of statutory reserves, state insurance regulators use two basic approaches.\n\nThe first of these is a rules-based approach, in which insurers are told how much of their premiums they must keep in reserve based on standardized formulas and assumptions.\n\nThe second approach, known as the principles-based approach, gives insurers greater leeway in setting their reserves. Specifically, it allows them to set reserves based on their own experience, such as theactuarial statisticsand past claims behavior of their own customers, provided that they are as large or larger than the reserves stipulated under the rules-based approach.\n\nWhen an insurance company chooses to keep reserves that are in excess of the minimum amount required under the rules-based approach, these are referred to as non-statutory or voluntary reserves.\n\nRegardless of the approach used to calculate them, statutory reserves will generally cause insurance companies to lose out on some potential profits. However, they benefit the insurance markets as a whole by making insurance customers more confident that their insurers will be able to withstand difficult economic circumstances and stand behind their policies.\n\nConsider the case of XYZ Insurance. According to the statutory reserve requirements of its state insurance regulator, XYZ would be required to keep $50 million in reserve based on the rules-based approach. However, after considering the competitive landscape in its state and reviewing the past performance of its insurance portfolio, XYZ decided to use the principles-based approach and set its statutory reserves above the minimum required level.\n\nAlthough the additional reserves would likely cost it in terms of lostinvestment income, XYZ reasoned that this more conservative approach would strengthen its image as a responsible insurer and make it well-positioned to navigate any potentialrecessionor other economic headwinds.",
