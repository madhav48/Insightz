  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nJiwon Ma is a fact checker and research analyst with a background in cybersecurity, international security, technology, and privacy policies. Before joining Investopedia, she consulted for a global financial institution on cybersecurity policies and conducted research as a Research Analyst at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nThe UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is an international organization that works to promote the incorporation ofenvironmental, social, and corporate governance factors (ESG)into investment decision-making.\n\nLaunched in April 2006 with support from theUnited Nations (UN), the PRI has over 4,900 participating financial institutions, as of March 31, 2021. These institutions participate by becoming signatories to the PRI\u2019s six key principles and then filing regular reports on their progress.\n\nThey core philosophy behind the organization is that environmental and social considerations are relevant factors in investment decision-making and should therefore be considered by responsible investors. For example, supporters of the PRI argue that it is both financially and ethically irresponsible to not consider the environmental impact of a company when assessing its merits as an investment. By contrast, many investors have historically viewed environmental and social impacts asnegative externalitieswhich can be ignored for purposes of investment decisions.\n\nTo combat this long-prevailing attitude, the PRI put forward six core principles, to which signatory companies must agree to commit themselves. As expressed on the organization\u2019s website, these six principles are as follows:\n\nCollectively, the organizations that have become signatories to these six principles are responsible for a totalassets under management (AUM)of over $121 trillion.This includes many prominent founding signatories who helped launch the program, such as the Norwegian Government Pension Fund; the Government Pension Fund of Thailand; the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and theCalifornia Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPERS).\n\nStandard Life is a financial services company that was acquired by Manulife in 2015. Standard Life\u2014a PRI signatory\u2014uses ESG factors to assess emerging risks and opportunities in the automobilesupply chain, particularly as it relates to new anti-pollution legislation being considered by theEuropean Union (EU).\n\nAfter analyzing the potential impact of this new legislation on various automakers and parts suppliers, the company decided to make adjustments to their investments in that sector and also updated their valuation estimate of the lithium-ion battery manufacturer, LG Chem. This upward adjustment was due in part to their belief that the increased emission standards would accelerate the transition towardelectric vehiclesand create an increased demand for batteries worldwide.\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \u201cSignatory Update Jan to March 2022,\u201d Page 30.\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \u201cSignatory Update Jan to March 2022,\u201d Page 31.\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \u201cWhat Are the Principles for Responsible Investment?\u201d\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \"Signatory Directory.\"\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \"RI Transparency Report 2020: Manulife Investment Management,\u201d Page 31.\n\nPrinciples for Responsible Investment. \"A Practical Guide to ESG Integration for Equity Investing,\" Page 18.",
