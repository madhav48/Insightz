  "definition": "Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nA financial controller is a high-level day-to-day manager of a company's accounting and financial systems.\n\nA financial controller is responsible for all of a company's accounting-related activities, including oversight of its operating budget, financial reporting systems, and payroll.\n\nThe duties of a controller include assisting with the preparation of the company's operating budget, overseeing the preparation of its financial reports, and managing its payroll system.\n\nThe controller's work is focused on the collection, analysis, and consolidation of financial data. Although the controller doesn't directly manage the budget, the job includes monitoring any variances, summarizing spending trends, and investigating budget deficiencies.\n\nController functionsvary widely depending on the size and complexity of the business and the industry.\n\nSmaller companies demand more versatility of the controller, while larger companies might disperse job responsibilities among the controller, the chief financial officer, and the treasurer.\n\nFinancial controllers are usually responsible for ensuring that financial transactions are reported accurately. This may range across all finance departments including accounts payable, purchasing, vendor management, treasury, financial reporting, and financial planning.\n\nThe controller of an organization may have several accounting managers as direct reports and may be involved in recruiting, selecting, and training the people that hold those positions.\n\nA joint publication by the Institute of Management Accountants and Deloitte Development LLC outlined the four primary roles a controller takes on.These four roles include:\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects a 10-year growth outlook from 2023-2033 for financial managers (controllers) of 17%, which is \"much faster than average.\"\n\nThe role of the controller is different in every company. For many, the controller will take on at least some of the following tasks:\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, a controller makes a median of roughly $156,000 per year including base pay and additional compensation.\n\nTo become a financial controller, finance professionals must often have achieved proficiency in three aspects of their career: education, experience, and licensure.\n\nBecoming a financial controller almost always requires at least a bachelor's degree in accounting, finance, business administration, or a similar field. A master's degree is preferred or required.\n\nMost financial professionals must obtain at least five to ten years of professional experience to be considered for a controller role. A large public corporation will seek 20+ years of experience in a related industry. Some companies require that a controller candidate have public accounting experience.\n\nThere is no industry-wide requirement that a controller be licensed as acertified public accountant(CPA),certified management accountant(CMA), orchartered financial analyst(CFA) but some companies may prefer or require at least a CPA license.\n\nMany controllers get their start in the accounting field, often inpublic accounting. Those most serious about achieving controller roles should go forBig Fourpositions and earn escalating responsibilities over several years.\n\nAfter moving to the corporate sector, a controller may continue to develop skills as an accountant booking transactions or a manager overseeing the operations of a specific finance department. This includes developing gaps related to receivables reporting, payroll, quarterly financial reporting, or internal controls.\n\nControllers often transition into the role of assistant controller before making the jump to a full controller role. An assistant controller is simply a more junior position that may perform many of the same tasks as a controller.\n\nA controller is engrained in a company's financial accounting process. However, the controller may not directly perform accounting tasks, and there is a difference between accounting and controlling.\n\nIn financial management, controlling is the act of ensuring data is recorded accurately and on time. This is a broader function of accounting, as the controlling function may go behind recording transactions.\n\nFor example, a controller may oversee the accounts payable department responsible for1099 reporting. Though this process is unrelated to internal accounting transactions, the controller may be a stakeholder in the process and give feedback on process improvement implementations.\n\nAn accounts payable clerk is responsible for the accounting of liabilities tied to invoices, whereas a controller may be more concerned with the overall accuracy and timeliness in which invoices are being processed and payments remitted.\n\nIn larger companies, controllers report up to a CFO or other executive. The controller is usually not part of the executive leadership team.\n\nDepending on the size and organizational layout of a company, the controller may hold more than one title or be responsible for multiple aspects of finance. In general, especially for larger companies, there are differences between controllers and other high-ranking financial positions.\n\nAlthough both the controller andCFOof a company are leaders in finance, they are often two separate positions responsible for different tasks. A controller is more likely to be entangled in general ledgers, trial balances, and financial reports being delivered to more senior management. Meanwhile, a CFO utilizes these reports to focus on more broad, big-picture company positioning.\n\nIn general, CFOs often take a greater presence in external-facing tasks including mergers, acquisitions, or involvement with investors. Meanwhile, financial controllers own more of the internal reporting process including implementing internal controls, managing the month-end close schedule, and ensuring financial accuracy.\n\nIn many situations, a company's vice president of finance mimics the traditional role of CFO. A vice president is often tasked with the highest level of financial and accounting oversight, while a controller's role is limited to the financial preparation and management of the financial reporting process.\n\nIn companies with both a controller and vice president of finance, the controller would most likely report directly to the vice president.\n\nFinancial controllers are in charge of the past. They review historical transactions and ensure reporting is done correctly.\n\nThese reports may then be delivered to a financial planning and analysis (FP&A) leader. This FP&A director relies on their team to build budgets,forecasts, and long-term plans based on the future of the company.\n\nA controller's role is heavily (if not exclusively) rooted in dealing with actual transactions. Overseeing both revenue and expense reporting, a controller often does not deal in theory.\n\nMeanwhile, an FP&A director leverages historical data to devise plans that may or may not materialize. These plans may rotate quarterly if the company decides to revise any projections.\n\nA variation of the controller position is called a comptroller. A comptroller is typically a more senior position that is more commonly found in government or nonprofit organizations. A controller and comptroller have similar roles in different industries.\n\nA controller often oversees the department leads within finance for each respective department tied to financial reporting. This may include the accounts payable lead, procurement lead, purchasing lead, financial reporting manager, or payroll manager.\n\nA controller is not the same as a CFO or VP of Finance. A CFO or VP of Finance are often higher-level positions that are on the executive team. A controller is less involved in strategic planning or external affairs and more involved in internal reporting.\n\nControllers are \"control\" the financial risk and financial reporting aspects of a company. A controller is the point person for making sure the financial reporting is done correctly. They understand why inaccuracies may exist, what changes must be put in place, and how those changes will impact future reports.\n\nA financial controller is a higher-level finance officer who is responsible for the financial reporting process. Not quite an executive-level position at most companies, a controller oversees many of the processes that come together to deliver financial statements.\n\nA controller also works with the external audit team, assists internal managers will budget preparation, and identifies areas of opportunity to mitigate risk and employ cost savings.\n\nInstitute of Management Accountants. \"Stepping Outside the Box: Elevating the Role of the Controller.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Financial Managers.\"\n\nGlassdoor. \"How Much Does a Controller Make?\"",
