She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nOrganic growth is achieved internally by boosting production and driving sales growth without buying new businesses.\n\nOrganic growth is the expansion that a company achieves by raising production levels and increasing sales internally. This does not include profits or growth attributable tomergers and acquisitions (M&A)but rather a rise in sales and expansion through the company's own resources. Organic growth helps companies maintain control and boost investor confidence. It stands in contrast toinorganic growth, which is growth related to activities outside a business's operations.\n\nAn organic growth strategy seeks to maximize growth from within. There are many ways in which a company can increase sales internally in an organization. These strategies typically take the form of optimization, reallocation of resources, and new product innovation and offerings.\n\nOptimization of a business focuses on continuing to improve a business's processes to reduce costs and set appropriate pricing strategies for products or services. Reallocation of resources involves allocating funds and other materials to the production of the best-performing products. New product innovation and offerings seek to grow a business by developing and evolving new goods and services that will meet consumers' needs and help boost profits.\n\nOrganic growth is considered a slower growth strategy because it takes time to acquire new customers and expand business with existing customers. A combination of both organic and inorganic growth is ideal for a company, as it diversifies the revenue base without relying solely on current operations to growmarket share.\n\nOrganic growth allows companies to expand using their existing resources. It shows that the company is strong enough to survive organically without any external forces. Here are some of the primary reasons why it is so important for businesses:\n\nOrganic control can help increaseoperational efficiencyby increasing output, improving production, and lowering costs.\n\nCompanies often use revenue andearningsgrowth on a quarterly or yearly basis as the performance metrics by which to gauge organic growth. Pursuing organic sales growth often includes promotions, new product lines, or improved customer service.\n\nThis type of growth is important because investors want to see that a company they are invested in (or plan to invest in) is capable of earning more than it did the prior year\u2014a feat that often reflects in a higher stock price or increaseddividendpayouts.\n\nIn some industries, particularly in retail, organic growth is measured ascomparable growthorcompsin a 13-week period. Comparable store sales, and sometimes same-store sales, give the\u00a0revenue growth of existing stores over a selected period. In other words, comps do not factor in growth from new store openings or M&A.\n\nFirms such as Walmart (WMT) and other big-box retailers report\u00a0comps every quarter to give investors and analysts an idea of their organic growth.\n\nWalmart\u00a0grew its comp sales by 4.5% in the 52 weeks ending Jan. 31, 2025\u2014a clear example of organic growth that Walmart's chief executive officer CEO attributed to a strategic focus on e-commerce and faster delivery times.\n\nIf company A grows at a rate of 5% and company B grows at a rate of 25%, most investors would opt to invest in company B. The assumption is that company A is growing at a slower rate than company B, and therefore has a lowerrate of return.\n\nThere is, however, another scenario to consider. What if Company B grew revenues by 25% because it bought out its competitor for $12 billion?\u00a0The reason Company B purchased its competitor is that its sales declined by 5%.\n\nCompany B might be growing, but there appears to be a lot of risk connected to its growth, while Company A is growing by 5% without an acquisition or the need to take on more debt. Perhaps Company A is the better investment, even though it grew at a much slower rate than Company B. Some investors may be willing to take on the additional risk, but others opt for the safer investment.\n\nCompany A is the safer investment, which grew revenue organically by 5%. The growth required no merger or acquisition and occurred due to higher demand for its current products. Company B's revenue dropped by 5%, which is a decline in organic growth. Overall growth increased due to acquisitions by borrowing money. Its growth relies on acquisitions rather than itsbusiness model, which\u00a0may not be\u00a0favorable to\u00a0investors.\n\nA typical example of organic growth is a company building new factories or introducing new products to expand its market. This is in contrast to buying an existing competitor, which would be considered inorganic growth.\n\nOrganic growth is considered a slower growth strategy, although it tends to be more sustainable in the long run. Organic growth is a gradual strategy where a company seeks to expand marketing, increase sales, and determine consumer needs. Although this strategy is relatively slow, it allows a company to build momentum with each successful iteration.\n\nInorganic growth is a corporate strategy where a company seeks to expand through mergers or acquisitions of other companies. This is faster than organic growth strategies, allowing the company to rapidly acquire new consumers or infrastructure. The downside is that such acquisitions tend to be costly and are difficult to sustain as a long-term strategy.\n\nOrganic growth involves the expansion of a company by introducing new products or targeting additional consumers. In contrast with inorganic growth strategies, such as mergers, this type of growth requires an intimate understanding of consumer desires and how to meet their needs. For investors, consistent organic growth can be a sign that a company has a strong understanding of its market and customers.\n\nWalmart. \"Walmart reports fourth quarter results,\" Page 3.",
