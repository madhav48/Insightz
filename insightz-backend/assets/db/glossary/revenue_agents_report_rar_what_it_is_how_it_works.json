  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe Revenue Agent\u2019s Report (RAR) is a detailed document that describes an IRS examiner's audit findings and states the amount of deficiency or refund the agent finds the taxpayer to owe or be owed, respectively.\ufeff\ufeff Taxpayers have the right to disagree with a revenue agent's report and can choose to fight the agent's findings through a formal protest to the IRS Office of Appeals division by appealing to theU.S. Tax Court, or by paying the new assessment but then suing for a refund.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe Revenue Agent\u2019s Report (RAR) shows how any adjustments made to a taxpayer\u2019s liability was calculated, including the procedures applied, tests performed, information obtained, and the conclusions reached in the examination. The report (Form 4549: Income Tax Examination Changes) shows the changes to items of income,credits, anddeductionsan examiner or agent is proposing to the taxpayer\u2019s return in addition to the proposed taxes, penalties, and interest, if any. Form 4549 is also accompanied by Form 886A, which explains the reason for the IRS changing a taxpayer\u2019s return.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe bottom line of the RAR states whether the taxpayer underpaid, overpaid, or paid the correct amount of taxes. If the taxpayer overpaid, s/he receives atax refund. If s/he underpaid, s/he must pay additional taxes, often with interest and penalties. If an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) agent\u2019s report following an audit on a taxpayer\u2019s return results in changes to the taxpayer\u2019s federaltaxable income, the IRS will send a notice of final determination to the taxpayer. Upon receiving the notice, a taxpayer has 30 days to appeal the changes with the IRS Office of Appeals.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe IRS notifies state tax authorities when it issues a RAR. State laws require that if the federal government changes a taxpayer's liability, the taxpayer must file an amended state return within 30 to 90 days following the final determination of the IRS audit. States require that the taxpayer redetermine their statetax liabilities, taking into account the adjustments reflected in the RAR, and provide notification to applicable state tax authorities regarding any related impact.\ufeff\ufeff States have this requirement because the tax liability for any given state is based on federal tax liability.\n\nIf a taxpayer is deemed to owe more federal tax than what was paid, the taxpayer likely owes more to the state as well. This statute applies whether the taxpayer is an individual or a business. If the taxpayer pays tax in multiple states, the compliance process can be quite burdensome.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Revenue Agent Reports (RARs).\" Accessed Feb. 11, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Requesting an Appeal.\" Accessed Feb. 11, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 4549-E (Rev. 12-2004) Department of the Treasury-Internal Revenue Service Income Tax Discrepancy Adjustments,\" Pages 1-2.
