  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nQualified Production Activities Income (QPAI) is the portion of income derived from domestic manufacturing and production that qualifies for reduced taxation. More specifically, qualified production activities income is the difference between the manufacturer's domestic gross receipts and aggregate cost of goods and services related to producing domestic goods.\ufeff\ufeff The tax-deductibility of QPAI is intended to reward manufacturers for producing goods domestically instead of overseas.\n\nSection 199 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) mandates that Qualified Production Activities Income (QPAI) be taxed at a lower rate.\ufeff\ufeff QPAI refers to certain income related to manufacturing that is equal to the excess of the business taxpayer's domestic productiongross receipts(DPGR) over the sum of the cost of goods that are allocable to such receipts, and other expenses, losses, ordeductionswhich are properly allocable to such receipts. Domestic production gross receipts (DPGR) are gross receipts from the manufacture, production, growth, or extraction of qualifying production property. A company that generates QPAI in a qualifying tax year qualifies for thedomestic production activities deduction(DPAD).\ufeff\ufeff\n\nU.S.-based business\u2019 allowable DPAD generally cannot be more than 9% of its QPAI. A taxpayer with oil-related QPAI also must reduce the DPAD by 3% of the least of the following amounts \u2013 Oil-related QPAI, QPAI, andadjusted gross incomefor an individual, estate, or trust (taxable income for all other taxpayers) figured without DPAD.\ufeff\ufeff In addition, the deduction is limited to 50% of theW-2 wagespaid by the taxpayer during the calendar year that ends with (or within) the tax year. An employer that did not pay any Form W-2 wages (or have Form W-2 wages allocated to him/her on aSchedule K-1), cannot claim a DPAD.\ufeff\ufeff The DPAD was in effect for small and large U.S.-based business activities between 2005 and 2017 and expired on December 31, 2017.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIRC Section 199 defines qualified production activities to include:\n\nQPAI will be the same asgross incomefor a business that engages in only one line of business, but businesses with multiple lines of businesses must allocate their incomes.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIndividuals, corporations, cooperatives, estates, and trusts use IRS Form 8903 to figure their allowable qualified production activities income. QPAI and Form W-2 wages are figured by only taking into account items that are attributable to the actual conduct of a trade or business. QPAI does not include revenue generated from the restaurant industry, electricity or natural gas distribution, or real estate transactions.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 8903,\" Pages 1, 3.\u00a0Accessed Feb. 4, 2020.\n\nU.S. Government Publishing Office. \"26 U.S.C Section 199(a),\" Page 816.
