  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nQuick assets refer to assets owned by a company with a commercial or exchange value that can easily be converted into cash\u00a0or that are already in a cash form. Quick assets are therefore considered to be the most highlyliquid assetsheld by a company. They include cash and equivalents,marketable securities, and accounts receivable. Companies use quick assets to calculate certain financial ratios that are used in decision making, primarily thequick ratio.\n\nUnlike other types ofassets, quick assets represent economic resources that can be turned into cash in a relatively short period of time without a significant loss of value. Cash and cash equivalents are the most liquid current asset items included in quick assets, while marketable securities and accounts receivable are also considered to be quick assets. Quick assets excludeinventories, because it may take more time for a company to convert them into cash.\n\nCompanies typically keep some portion of their quick assets in the form of cash and marketable securities as a buffer to meet\u00a0their immediate operating, investing, or financing needs. A company that has a low cash balance in its quick assets may satisfy its need\u00a0for liquidity by tapping into its available lines of credit.\n\nDepending on the nature of a business and the industry in which it operates, a substantial portion of quick assets may be tied to accounts receivable. For example, companies that sell products and services to corporate clients may have large accounts receivable balances, while retail companies that sell products to individual consumers may have negligible accounts receivable on their balance sheets.\n\nAnalysts most often use quick assets to assess a company's ability to satisfy its immediate bills and obligations that are due within a one-year period. The total amount of quick assets is used in the quick ratio, sometimes referred to as the acid test, which is a financial ratio that divides the sum of a company's cash and equivalents, marketable securities, and accounts receivable by itscurrent liabilities. This ratio allows investment professionals to determine whether a company can meet its financial obligations if its revenues or cash collections happen to slow down.\n\nThe formula for the quick ratio is:\n\n\ufeffQuick\u00a0Ratio=C\u00a0&\u00a0E+MS+ARCurrent\u00a0Liabilitieswhere:C\u00a0&\u00a0E=cash\u00a0&\u00a0equivalentsMS=marketable\u00a0securitiesAR=accounts\u00a0receivable\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac { \\text{C \\& E} + \\text{MS} + \\text{AR} }{ \\text{Current Liabilities} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{C \\& E} = \\text{cash \\& equivalents} \\\\ &\\text{MS} = \\text{marketable securities} \\\\ &\\text{AR} = \\text{accounts receivable} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bQuick\u00a0Ratio=Current\u00a0LiabilitiesC\u00a0&\u00a0E+MS+AR\u200bwhere:C\u00a0&\u00a0E=cash\u00a0&\u00a0equivalentsMS=marketable\u00a0securitiesAR=accounts\u00a0receivable\u200b\ufeff\n\n\ufeffQuick\u00a0Ratio=CA\u2212Inventory\u2212PECurrent\u00a0Liabilitieswhere:CA=current\u00a0assetsPE=prepaid\u00a0expenses\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Quick Ratio} = \\frac { \\text{CA} - \\text{Inventory} - \\text{PE} }{ \\text{Current Liabilities} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{CA} = \\text{current assets} \\\\ &\\text{PE} = \\text{prepaid expenses} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bQuick\u00a0Ratio=Current\u00a0LiabilitiesCA\u2212Inventory\u2212PE\u200bwhere:CA=current\u00a0assetsPE=prepaid\u00a0expenses\u200b\ufeff\n\nQuick assets offer analysts a more conservative view of a\u00a0company\u2019s liquidity or ability to meet\u00a0its short-term liabilities with its short-term assets because it doesn't\u00a0include harder to sell inventory andother current assetsthat can be difficult to liquidate. By excluding inventory,\u00a0and other less liquid assets,\u00a0the quick assets focus on the company\u2019s most liquid assets.\n\nThe quick ratio can also be contrasted against the current ratio, which is equal to a company's totalcurrent assets, including its inventories, divided by its current liabilities. The quick ratio represents a more stringent test for the liquidity of a company in comparison to the current ratio.\n\nThe word quick originates with the Old English cwic, which meant \"alive\" or \"alert.\"",
