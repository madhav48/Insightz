  "term": "Aggregate Stop-Loss Insurance: Overview, Calculations",
  "definition": "Aggregate stop-loss insurance is a policy designed to limit claim coverage (losses) to a specific amount. This coverage ensures that a catastrophic claim (specific stop-loss) or numerous claims (aggregate stop-loss) do not drain the financial reserves of a self-funded plan. Aggregate stop-loss protects the employer against claims that are higher than expected. If total claims exceed theaggregate limit, the stop-loss insurer covers the claims orreimbursesthe employer.\n\nAggregate stop-loss insurance is held for\u00a0self-funded insurance plans for which an\u00a0employer assumes thefinancial riskof providing healthcare benefits to its employees. In practical terms, self-funded employers pay for each claim as it is presented instead of paying a fixed premium to an insurance carrier for a fully insured plan. Stop-loss insurance is similar to purchasing high-deductible insurance. The employer remains responsible for claim expenses under the deductible amount.\n\nStop-loss insurance differs from conventional employee benefit insurance. Stop-loss only covers the employer and provides no direct coverage to employees andhealth planparticipants.\n\nAggregate stop-loss insurance is used by employers as coverage for risk against a high value of claims. Aggregate stop-loss insurance comes with a maximum level for claims. When a maximum threshold is exceeded, the employer no longer needs to make payments and may receive some reimbursements.\n\nAggregate stop-loss insurance can either be added to an existing insurance plan or purchased independently. The threshold is calculated based on a certain percentage of\u00a0projected costs (called attachment points)\u2014usually 125%\u00a0of anticipated claims for the year.\n\nAn aggregatestop-loss thresholdis usually variable and not fixed. This is because the threshold fluctuates as a percentage of an employer\u2019s enrolled employees. The variable threshold is based on an aggregate attachment factor which is an important component in the calculation of a stop-loss level.\n\nAs is the case with high deductible plans, most stop-loss plans will have relatively low premiums. This is because the employer is expected to cover over 100% of the value of claims they receive.\n\nAccording to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation 2018 Employer Health Benefits Survey, insurers now offer health plans with a self-funded option for small or medium-sized employers; these health plans incorporate stop-loss insurance with low attachment points.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe aggregate attachment associated with a stop-loss plan is calculated as follows:\n\nThe employer and stop-loss insurance provider estimate the average dollar value of claims expected by employee per month. This value will depend on the employer\u2019s estimate but often ranges from $200 to $500 per month.\n\nAssume the stop-loss plan uses a value of $200. This value would then be multiplied by the stop-loss attachment multiplier which usually ranges from 125% to 175%. Using a claims estimate of $200 and a stop-loss attachment multiplier of 1.25, the monthly deductible would be $250 per month per employee ($200 x 1.25 = $250).\n\nThis deductible must then be multiplied by the employer\u2019s plan enrollment for the month. Assuming that an employer has 100 employees in the first month of coverage, their total deductible would be $25,000 for the month ($250 x 100).\n\nEnrollment can potentially vary per month. Due to enrollment variance, aggregate stop-loss coverage may have either a monthly deductible or an annual deductible.\n\nWith a monthly deductible, the amount an employer must pay could change every month. With an annual deductible, the amount the employer must pay would be summed for the year and usually based on estimates from the initial month of coverage. Many stop-loss plans will offer an annual deductible that is slightly lower than the summation of deductibles over 12 months.\n\nHenry J.
