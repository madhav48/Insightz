Hong Kong is one of China'sspecial administrative regions (SARs). A SAR is a relatively autonomous region within the People's Republic of China that maintains separate legal, administrative, and judicial systems from the rest of the country.\n\nHong Kong is a special administrative region (SAR) that exists as part of the People\u2019s Republic of China under the \u201cOne Country, Two Systems\u201d doctrine, negotiated in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, negotiated and signed in 1984, but taking effect in 1997.\n\nThe \"One Country, Two Systems\" doctrine stipulated that the People's Republic of China's socialist system would not be practiced in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong would maintain its political and economic quasi-independence\u00a0for 50 years after the transfer of sovereignty, until 2047.\n\nWhat does that mean? Since July 1, 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred the sovereignty of\u00a0Hong Kong to China, Hong Kong has maintained a separate political and economic system from China\u2014democratic(ish), and capitalist\u2014and\u00a0a separate currency (theHong Kong Dollar, HKD$).\n\nHong Kong retains\u00a0independent executive, legislative, and judiciary powers, in all matters other than military defense and foreign affairs. English and Chinese are the two official languages.\n\nHong Kong was\u00a0ranked as the world's freest economy in the Heritage Foundation'sIndex of Economic Freedomfrom the index's inception in 1995, until 2020 when Singapore knocked it off the top spot to number two. However, the following year, in 2021, the index stopped including Hong Kong and Macau due to an increase in China's influence.\n\nIn 1990,Milton Friedmanwrote that it was perhaps the best example of a free market economy. The service economy in Hong Kong is characterized primarily by low taxation, near-free port trade, and a well-established international financial market. Service economy, here, means an economy that is not industrial, or manufacturing based, but is instead based on financial services, health, and human services, hospitality, information technology, etc.\n\nUsing its political and economic autonomy, Hong Kong has positioned itself as the place where international and Chinese businesses find common ground. It is also considered the principal financial center in China.\u00a0As a result, more than 9,000 companies in Hong Kong have parent companies located outside of Hong Kong in 2023.\n\nThis democratic government and thefree markethave been\u00a0successful, to some extent. It's the world's 43rd largest economy in 2022 with a population smaller than the city of Tokyo, at 7.35 million in 2022. Hong Kong had a GDP of\u00a0$359.8 billion in 2022, giving it the world's 28th\u00a0highest\u00a0GDP per capita, at\u00a0$48,983 in 2022.\n\nHistorically, China has had considerable incentive to refrain from interfering in Hong Kong's political and economic systems. At\u00a0the transfer of sovereignty in 1997, Hong Kong, with a population of 6.5 million at the time, had an economy one-fifth the size of the Chinese economy, which had a population of\u00a0over 1.2 billion.\n\nThis is no longer the case. Over the past 20 years, Hong Kong's economy has stagnated,\u00a0changing\u00a0very little in makeup,\u00a0withGDPgrowth slowing, and inequality rising significantly. During the same period, China became an economic superpower.\u00a0As of 2022, Hong Kong\u00a0now accounts for just\u00a02% of Chinese GDP.\n\nSome think that the greatest risk to Hong Kong's autonomy\u00a0is political and business elites in the region ceding it\u00a0to the Liaison Office, to remove political tensions from the region, and return Hong Kong to an economic city.\n\nThis may prove a poor decision though, as a marriage of business and government has proven counterproductive in Hong Kong, leading to an increase in conflicts of interest and cronyism, not to mention a non-responsive government that refuses to broaden its tax base or lowerproperty taxes, and has excluded political parties from democratic participation. All of this has led to a public perception of the\u00a0Hong Kong SAR government as not as\u00a0legitimate as it once was.\n\nGiven these recent trends, the Liaison Office, the People's Republic of China representative in Hong Kong, has been taking steps to meaningfully increase its influence and clout in the region, interfering in both domestic affairs and elections.\n\nFor example, the Liaison Office bought\u00a0Hong Kong's largest publishing house (removing titles critical of the Communist Party) and lobbied\u00a0for Hong Kong's 2017 chief executive, Carrie Lam. In 2022, Lam stepped down.\n\nHong Kong is a large financial center with many banks and financial institutions. The region has favorable tax laws and a strong financial market with its own stock market. The currency, the Hong Kong dollar, is pegged to the U.S. dollar.\n\nAccording to the Global Financial Centres Index 34, published in Sept. 2023, Hong Kong ranks fourth in a list of the top global financial centers, behind New York, London, and Singapore.\n\nYes, Hong Kong is financially stable. Despite protests and China's ever-expanding grip to bring Hong Kong further under its laws, Hong Kong remains a financially stable region.\n\nHong Kong is one of the leading financial centers in the world and for a large part of its history was under British rule, until it was \"returned\" to China in 1997. Hong Kong operated outside of China's sphere of politics for a long time after returning to the country; however, as China has grown, both in economic and political power, it has brought Hong Kong further into its control. The region continues to be a prominent financial hub in both Asia and the world.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Hong Kong: Recent Developments and U.S. Relations.\"\n\nThe CIA World Factbook. \"Hong Kong.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation. \"2020 Index of Economic Freedom: Global Economic Freedom Hits All-Time High.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation. \"2021 Index Of Economic Freedom: Global Economic Freedom Remains At All-Time High, U.S. Drops To An All-Time Low.\"\n\nHoover Institution. \"The Hong Kong Experiment.\"\n\nThe Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. \"2023 Annual Survey of Companies in Hong Kong with Parent Companies Located Outside Hong Kong.\"\n\nMacrotrends. \"Tokyo, Japan Metro Area Population 1950-2024.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"Population, Total - Hong Kong SAR, China.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"GDP (Current US$) - Hong Kong SAR, China.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"GDP Per Capita (Current US$) - Hong Kong SAR, China.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"GDP (Current US$) - Hong Kong SAR, China, China.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"Population, Total - China, Hong Kong SAR, China.\"\n\nThe Heritage Foundation. \"Hong Kong Is No Longer What It Was.\"\n\nSouth China Morning Post. \"Carrie Lam Admits Lobbying by Beijing Liaison Office in Hong Kong Leadership Race \u2018May Not Work in Her Favour\u2019.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"The Publishing Empire Helping China Silence Dissent in\u00a0Hong Kong.\"",
