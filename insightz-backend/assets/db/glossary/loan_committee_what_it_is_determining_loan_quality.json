  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nErika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA loan committee is the lending or management committee of a bank or other lending institution. It generally consists of upper-level officers with management authority. The loan committee analyzes and subsequently approves or rejects anyloanthat the initialloan officerdoes not have the authority to approve, typically those of large sizes or higher risk. The committee ensures that the loan meets the institution\u2019s standard lending policy. If it does, the committee can agree to fund and disburse the loan with a binding commitment.\n\nA loan committee is usually responsible for regular credit reviews of the bank\u2019s maturing loans, which are the ones whose terms are nearing completion and are up for renewal. For example, a 10-year loan in its ninth year would be a maturing loan and up for renewal if the borrower is interested in extending the loan. At times, a bank may extend the originalcredit facility, however, the loan committee must ensure that this is done in accordance with proper procedure. For the bank, it is important to make sure that the borrower\u2019screditworthinesshas not deteriorated.\n\nIn addition to reviewing maturing loans, a loan committee is responsible for reviewing new loans that may be large, complex, or come with a high risk. These types of loans are usually above the authority of the initial loan officer and require the approval of upper management, such as thechief risk officer(CRO) andchief financial officer(CFO).\n\nTo determine the creditworthiness of a borrower, a loan committee will conduct a valuation that includes factors such as the borrower\u2019s past repayment history andcredit score, along with the value of assets and liabilities on the individual\u2019s balance sheet, the purpose of the loan, the risks of the industry the individual or firm operates in,forecastingmodels, and other information that will paint a clear picture of the potential risks of the borrower. A loan committee analyzes and subsequently approves or rejects the loan. It may also approve the loan but with completely different terms than the borrower intended, which will mitigate any risks.\n\nThe threecredit reporting agenciesin the United States are Experian, Transunion, and Equifax, that report, update, and store consumers\u2019 credit histories, which loan committees incorporate into their decision to extend credit to a single borrower. The five main factors that these agencies use when calculating a credit score are payment history, the total amount owed, length of credit history, types of credit,\u00a0and new credit.\n\nA loan committee also determines which collection action should be taken on past-due loans.\u00a0Depending on the policy of the lending institution, once a borrower has missed their due date, the committee can either immediately charge a late fee or allow the borrower to enter a grace period.\n\nTo bring the account up to good standing, the borrower must make the requiredminimum monthly payments, including any late fees. Individuals or businesses that are 30 days behind schedule on loan payments will usually find that thedelinquentaccount has affected their credit report.\n\nFinally, a loan committee will also be charged with making sure that the bank is compliant with all regulations. This can include not only lending procedures but alsobankruptcyand receivership issues and even extend to the review of marketing materials that are provided to potential customers.",
