  "term": "Nonbank Financial Institutions: What They Are and How They Work",
  "definition": "Nonbank financial companies (NBFCs), also known as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), arefinancial institutionsthat offer various banking services but do not have a banking license. Generally, these institutions are not allowed to take traditionaldemand deposits\u2014readily available funds, such as those in checking or savings accounts\u2014from the public. This limitation keeps them outside the scope of conventionaloversight from federal and state financial regulators.\n\nNonbank financial companies fall under the oversight of theDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which describes them as companies \"predominantly engaged in a financial activity\" when more than 85% of their consolidated annual gross revenues or consolidated assets are financial in nature.Examples of NBFCs include investment banks, mortgage lenders, money market funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, and P2P lenders.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nNBFCs can offer services such as loans and credit facilities, currency exchange, retirement planning, money markets,underwriting, and merger activities.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act defines three types of nonbank financial companies: foreign nonbank financial companies, U.S. nonbank financial companies, and U.S. nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.\n\nForeign nonbank financial companies are incorporated or organized outside the U.S. and are predominantly engaged in financial activities such as those listed above. Foreign nonbanks may or may not have branches in the United States.\n\nU.S. nonbankfinancial companies, like their foreign nonbank counterparts, are predominantly engaged in nonbank financial activities but have been incorporated or organized in the United States. U.S. nonbanks are restricted from serving as Farm Credit System institutions, national securities exchanges, or any one of several other types of financial institutions.\n\nThe main difference between these nonbank financial companies and others is that they fall under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. This is based on a determination by the Board that financial distress or the \u201cnature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of activities\u201d at these institutions could threaten the financial stability of the United States.\n\nNBFCs existed long before the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2007, they were given the moniker \"shadow banks\" by economist Paul McCulley, at the time the managing director ofPacific Investment Management Company LLC (PIMCO), to describe the expanding matrix of institutions contributing to the then-current easy-money lending environment\u2014which in turn led to the subprime mortgage meltdown and the subsequent 2008 financial crisis.\n\nAlthough the term sounds somewhat sinister, many well-known brokerages and investment firms were engaging in shadow-banking activity. Investment bankers Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns were two of the most well-known NBFCs at the center of the 2008 crisis.\n\nAs a result of the ensuing financial crisis, traditional banks found themselves under closer regulatory scrutiny, which led to a prolonged contraction in their lending activities. As the authorities tightened up on the banks, the banks, in turn, tightened up on loan or credit applicants.\n\nThe more stringent requirements gave rise to more people needing other funding sources\u2014and hence, the growth of nonbank institutions that were able to operate outside the constraints of banking regulations. In short, in the decade following the financial crisis of 2007-08, NBFCs proliferated in large numbers and varying types, playing a key role in meeting the credit demand unmet by traditional banks.\n\nAdvocates of NBFCs argue that these institutions play an important role in meeting the rising demand for credit, loans, and other financial services. Customers include both businesses and individuals\u2014especially those who might have trouble qualifying under the more stringent standards set by traditional banks.\n\nNot only do NBFCs provide alternate sources of credit, proponents say, they also offer more efficient ones. NBFCs cut out the intermediary\u2014the role banks often play\u2014to let clients deal with them directly, lowering costs, fees, and rates, in a process calleddisintermediation. Providing financing and credit is important to keep the money supply liquid and the economy working well.\n\nAlternate source of funding and credit\n\nDirect contact with clients, eliminating intermediaries\n\nLiquidity for the financial system\n\nSystemic risk to financial system, economy\n\nEven so, critics are troubled by NBFCs' lack of accountability to regulators and their ability to operate outside the customary banking rules and regulations.In some cases, they may face oversight by other authorities\u2014 such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) if they're public companies, or the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) if they're brokerages. However, in other cases, they may be able to operate with a lack of transparency.\n\nAll of this could put an increasing strain on the financial system. NBFCs were at the epicenter of the 2008 financial crisis that led to the Great Recession. Critics point out that they have increased in numbers since then, and therefore represent a greater risk than ever before.\n\nEntities ranging from mortgage provider Quicken Loans to financial services firm Fidelity Investments qualify as NBFCs. However, the fastest-growing segment of the non-bank lending sector has been inpeer-to-peer (P2P)lending.\n\nThe growth of P2P lending has been facilitated by the power of social networking, which brings like-minded people from all over the world together. P2P lending websites, such as LendingClub and Prosper, are designed to connect prospective borrowers with investors willing to invest their money in loans that can generate high yields.\n\nP2P borrowers tend to be individuals who could not otherwise qualify for a traditional bank loan or who prefer to do business with non-banks. Investors have the opportunity to build a diversified portfolio of loans by investing small sums across a range of borrowers.\n\nAlthough P2P lending only represents a small fraction of the total loans issued in the United States,\u00a0Precedence Research reported that the peer to peer lending market had a size of $26.3 billion in 2023. This market size is expected to continuously grow over the next decade.\n\nThere are many types of NBFC. Some of the most familiar are:\n\nGenerally, none. These are alternative names for the same type of company.\n\nNBFCs are often called shadow banks as they function a lot like banks but with fewer regulatory controls. Barring a few, they cannot accept deposits from people and so raise money from bonds or borrow from banks.\n\nNonbank financial companies (NBFCs), also known as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs), are entities that provide similar services to a bank but do not hold a banking license. As a result, they are subject to different regulations than banks, and in many regards are less regulated than banks. There are many NBFCs. Investment banks, mortgage lenders, money market funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity funds, and P2P lenders are all examples of NBFCs.\n\nSince the Great Recession, NBFCs have proliferated in number and type, playing a key role in meeting the credit demand unmet by traditional banks. Their critics say that they pose a risk to the US economy; their proponents say they offer a valuable, alternative source of credit and funding.\n\nU.S. Congress. \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\" Pages 1391-1392.\n\nU.S. Congress. \"Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.\" Pages 1391-1392, 1398.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. \"Housing, Housing Finance, and Monetary Policy: General Discussion: Housing and Monetary Policy.\" Page 485.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Shadow Banks: Out of the Eyes of Regulators.\"\n\nRockoff, Hugh. \"Oh, How the Mighty Have Fallen: The Bank Failures and Near Failures That Started America\u2019s Greatest Financial Panics.\"National Bureau of Economic Research, Working Paper 28577, March 2021, pp. 1-34.\n\nDegerli, Ahmet and Jing Wang. \"The Rise of Nonbanks and the Quality of Financial Services: Evidence from Consumer Complaints.\"Federal Reserve Board, Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2022-059, July 2022, pp. 1-64.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"CFPB Invokes Dormant Authority to Examine Nonbank Companies Posing Risks to Consumers.\"\n\nAmerican Banker. \"Regulators Are Taking on Nonbanks \u2014 A Little Bit at a Time.\"\n\nPrecedence Research. \"Peer to Peer (P2P) Lending Market (by Type: Consumer Lending, Business Lending; by End User: Consumer Credit Loans, Small Business Loans, Student Loans, Real Estate Loans; by Business Model: Marketplace Lending, Traditional Lending) \u2013 Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, Regional Outlook, and Forecast 2024 \u2013 2033.\"",
