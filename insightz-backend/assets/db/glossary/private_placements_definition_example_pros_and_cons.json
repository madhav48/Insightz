  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA private placement is a sale of stock shares or bonds to pre-selected investors and institutions rather than on a public exchange.\u00a0It is an alternative to an initial public offering (IPO) for a young company seeking to raise money to expand.\n\nThe process is sometimes referred to as a 4(a)(2) private placement. The main process that enables such a sale is the 4(a)(2) exemption to Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules regarding registration of public companies. The 4(a)(2) exemption permits companies and buyers of their securities to conduct such transactions without the company first filing for registration with the SEC.\n\nPrivate placements have become a popular way for startups to raise money, particularly in the Internet and financial technology sectors. They allow these companies to grow and develop while avoiding the full glare of government and public scrutiny that accompanies an initial public offering (IPO).\n\nThere are minimal regulatory requirements and standards for a private placement even though, like anIPO, it involves the sale of securities. The sale does not have to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0(SEC). The\u00a0company is not required to provide a\u00a0prospectus\u00a0to potential investors and detailed financial information may not be disclosed.\n\nCompanies that sell shares privately can do so under either of two exemptions to the usual SEC rules requiring full registration:\n\nIn any case, accredited investors are defined as individuals and institutions that have a sophisticated knowledge of the securities industry and considerable financial resources.\n\nThat restricts access to private placements to wealthy individual investors, financial institutions like banks,\u00a0mutual funds, insurance companies, and\u00a0pension fund managers.\n\nThe sale of stock on public exchanges is regulated primarily by theSecurities Act of 1933. The law was enacted after the market crash of 1929 to ensure that investors receive sufficient disclosure when they purchase securities.\n\nRegulation D of that act provides an exemption for private placement offerings.\n\nThe same regulation allows an issuer to sell securities to a pre-selected group of\u00a0investors that meet specified requirements. Instead of a prospectus, private placements are sold using a private placement memorandum (PPM). They cannot be broadly marketed to the general public.\n\nA private placement allows a young company to put off the onerous process of registering for a public stock offering. Moreover, going public involves a considerable burden of quarterly and annual financial filings that many new companies can ill afford to undertake.\n\nA private company is relatively lightly regulated, as are private placements of stock shares.\n\nThat means the process ofunderwritingis faster, and the company gets its funding sooner. If the issuer is selling a bond, it also avoids the time and expense of obtaining a credit rating\u00a0from a bond agency.\n\nA private placement allows the issuer to sell a more complex security to accredited investors who understand the potential risks and rewards.\n\nThe buyer of a private placement bond issue expects a higher rate of interest than can be earned on a publicly traded security. Because of the additional risk, a private placement buyer may not buy a bond unless it is secured by specific collateral.\n\nA private placement stock investor may also demand a higher percentage of ownership in the business or a fixed dividend\u00a0payment per share of stock. This puts pressure on the company to perform at a higher level, which could lead it to ignore the careful process of healthy growth.\n\nThere also is a risk of a loss of control if private placements result in increased ownership by investors rather than founders.\n\nPrivate placements are conducted at invitation-only events, real or virtual. The prospective buyers are all accredited investors. They have registered with the SEC as investors who have the knowledge and the resources to participate in the sale.\n\nThe company raising money has to make its case for being a sound investment. However, it does not have to produce the full financial prospectus that is required of a company undergoing an initial public offering.\n\nAn initial public offering or IPO is a sale of stock, conducted on a stock exchange and open to the general public.\n\nDown the road, the company may offer a public offering or PO. The company issues another round of shares to raise more money.\n\nThere are many benefits to a private placement. These include a faster process than an IPO and fewer regulatory requirements than an IPO. There are also fewer regulatory obligations on an ongoing basis than being a public company entails.\n\nPrivate placements allow business owners to raise capital while foregoing the IPO process, which can be long, difficult, and burdensome. By opening their doors to pre-selected investors through private placements, businesses can raise funds for expansion while not having to abide by the many regulatory requirements that an IPO and being public demand.\n\nThere is a downside, given the demands of private investors seeking high returns for the increased risk they are taking on.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Private Placements - Rule 506(b).\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Private Placements - Rule 506(b).\"\n\nInvestor.gov. \"Regulation D Offerings.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Private Placements Under Regulation D - Investor Bulletin.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"The Laws That Govern the Securities Industry.\"",
