There are various situations when water damage legal liability insurance could help protect an individual from enormous costs.\n\nFor example, let's say the owners of a second-floor condo unit experienced a water heater explosion and the water leaked into the first floor. Water damage legal liability insurance would protect the owners of the second-floor condo by providing the money to repair the damage to the first-floor units. Without the insurance, the second-floor owners could be held responsible for paying for the repairs out of pocket.\n\nHomeowners insurancepolicies generally include water damage legal liability, either as part of the personal liability coverage or in a separate rider.

The liability extends to damage, destruction, or injury to others' structures, belongings, or even persons.\n\nHowever, if the triggering event and ensuing water damage are caused by poor maintenance, misconduct, or deliberate carelessness, the liabilitycoveragemight not apply, or your insurance company might reject the claim.\n\nBe aware of policies that limit your coverage for water damage and liability.
