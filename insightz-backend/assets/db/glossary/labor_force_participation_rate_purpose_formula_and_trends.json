  "definition": "The labor force participation rate is an estimate of an economy\u2019s active workforce. The U.S. government's labor force participation rate formula is the number of people ages 16 and older who are employed or actively seeking employment, divided by the total non-institutionalized, civilian working-age population.\n\nAs of December 2024, the U.S. labor force participation rate was 62.5%, according to theBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which publishes the figures monthly.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is an important metric to use when analyzing employment andunemploymentdata because it measures the number of people who are actively job-hunting as well as those who are currently employed.\n\nIt includes all other people aged 16 or older and compares the proportion of those who are working or seeking work outside the home to those who are neither working nor seeking work outside the home.It omits institutionalized people, such as individuals in prisons, nursing homes, mental health facilities, and members of the military.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is considered to be somewhat more reliable than the unemployment rate because it accounts for people who have given up looking for work. The unemployment numbers do not take into account those who have given up looking for work.\n\nSome economists argue that thelabor force participation rate and unemployment datashould be considered together to better understand an economy\u2019s real employment status.\n\nThe formula for labor force participation is:\n\n(Number\u00a0Employed+Number\u00a0Seeking\u00a0Work)\u00d7100Civilian\u00a0Non-Institutional\u00a0Population\\begin{aligned}&\\frac{ ( \\text{Number Employed} + \\text{Number Seeking Work} ) \\times 100 }{ \\text{Civilian Non-Institutional Population} } \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bCivilian\u00a0Non-Institutional\u00a0Population(Number\u00a0Employed+Number\u00a0Seeking\u00a0Work)\u00d7100\u200b\u200b\n\nThis applies to all members of the population at age 16 or older.\n\nLabor force participation is affected by numerous social, economic, and demographic factors. As these factors change, labor force participation goes up or down. These changes can happen quickly or slowly. They might have a short-term impact on labor force participation, or they might create long-term change.\n\nShort- and long-term economic trends influence the labor force participation rate. In the long run, industrialization and the accumulation of wealth can have an impact.\n\nIndustrialization tends to increase participation by creating employment opportunities. High levels of accumulated wealth can reduce participation because wealthier people simply have less need to work for a living.\n\nIn the short term,business cyclesand unemployment rates influence the participation rate. During an economic recession, the labor force participation rate tends to fall because many laid-off workers become discouraged and give up looking for jobs. Economic policies such as heavy labor market regulation and generous social benefit programs may tend to decrease labor force participation.\n\nSocial expectations and changes to those expectations affect who is available to participate in the workforce. As different groups are expected to work or not, the labor force participation rate will go up or down.\n\nFor example, if married men are considered responsible for supporting their families, while married women are encouraged to stay home, women will stop working once married or after having children, which lowers the labor force participation rate. If the expectation is that both parents should be able to work, some parents of either gender will opt to stay in the workforce.\n\nEducationalexpectations impact the labor force participation rate. If more young people learn a trade or a family business as they are growing up and skip college, adults start entering the workforce between the ages of 17 and 19.\n\nIn countries or demographic groups where a college degree is regarded as a necessity, more young adults will continue their education after high school. Labor force participation will go down because they won't join the workforce until their early or mid-twenties.\n\nChanges in the working-age population from generation to generation influence labor force participation. As large age cohorts reach retirement age, the labor force participation rate can fall.\n\nFor example, the retirement ofa steady stream of baby boomershas reduced labor force participation. Baby boomers are one of the largest demographic blocks in the population. Since generations after the baby boomers are smaller, they will not be replaced by as many active, younger workers when they retire.\n\nThe labor force participation rate changes based on economic, social, anddemographic trendsover the long term. It rose steadily through the second half of the 20th century, peaking at 67.3% in April 2000. As the Great Recession hit in 2008, the participation rate entered several years of steep decline, stabilizing at around 63% by 2013.\n\nFrom 2013 on, the monthly figures held steady in the vicinity of 63%, however, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, the labor force participation rate fell dramatically, dropping from 63.3% to 60.1% in the first half of the year. The low point of 60.1% was in April 2020, after which the rate began to increase slowly. As of December 2024, it sits at 62.5%.\n\nThe trend in the women\u2019s labor force participation rate largely parallels the long-term trends for the overall population. The women\u2019s labor force participation rate nearly doubled from 32% to 60% in the 50 years from 1948 to 1998. This rate dropped to 54.6% in April 2020 from 57.9% in February 2020. As of December 2024, it sits at 57.4%.\n\nThe U.S. labor force participation rate of 62.5% in December 2024 included 57.4% participation for women and 67.9% participation for men.\n\nAccording to theFederal Reserve, the share of prime-working-age people (25 to 54 years old) in the labor force peaked at 72% in 1995 and has declined since then. This roughly corresponds to some of the declining trends in labor force participation in the 21st century. There are reasons for this decline.\n\nThe national unemployment rate in the United States was 4.1% in December 2024.\n\nGlobal labor force participation has shown a steady decline since 1990. According to theWorld Bank, the global labor force participation rate stood at 61% as of 2023, down from 62% in 2010 and 65% in 1991. It dropped to a low of 59% in 2020 during the pandemic and has steadily been increasing since, reaching 61% as of 2023, the same level as before the pandemic in 2019.\n\nThe following table highlights the countries with the highest and lowest labor force participation rates as of 2023 (latest data available):\n\nThe labor force participation rate measures a country\u2019s active workforce of people 16 and older. It includes people who have stopped looking for work but still want to work. The official unemployment rate does not count those discouraged workers.\n\nThree major factors influence the rate: economic, demographic, and social. For instance, the recent retirement of baby boomers in great numbers has pushed the rate down, while the introduction of large numbers of women into the workforce in the second half of the 20th century increased the rate. In April 2020, after the COVID-19 pandemic struck the U.S., the rate went down by more than 3% compared to the beginning of that year.\n\nAccording to the World Bank's most recent data from 2023, the U.S. falls in the middle of the pack at 62% and ahead of the world rate of 61%. The highest rate was held by Qatar, at 89%, and the lowest by Djibouti, at 32%.\n\nThe labor force participation rate is based on a monthly household survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This survey asks respondents about their age and whether they are employed or looking for work. On that basis, the government estimates the labor force participation rate.\n\nThe participation rate has steadily declined since the late 1990s, largely due to the retirement of baby boomers and other significant demographic changes. In 2020, there was a sharp drop in labor participation due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which shuttered many businesses and forced many people to temporarily leave the workforce.\n\nThe unemployment rate is more closely watched but it is best understood when viewed in conjunction with the labor force participation rate.\n\nThat's because the labor force participation rate counts those discouraged workers, people who are willing and able to work but have given up looking for a job. Neither of these numbers exists in a vacuum. Many social, economic, and demographic factors cause the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate to fluctuate over time.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cLabor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey: Concepts and Definitions,\" Select \"Civilian Labor Force, or Labor Force.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey: Concepts and Definitions,\" Select \"Labor Force Participation Rate.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey: Concepts and Definitions,\" Select \"Civilian Noninstitutional Population.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Table A-15: Alternative Measures of Labor Underutilization.\"\n\nU.S. Census. \"Demographic Turning Points for the United States: Population Projections for 2020 to 2060,\" Pages 1, 4-5.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Labor Force Participation Rate.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"The Employment Situation,\" Page 11.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cLabor Force Participation Rate \u2014 Women.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Labor Force Status of Women & Men.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cDemographics Help Explain the Fall in the Labor Force Participation Rate.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cLabor Force Projections to 2020: A More Slowly Growing Workforce,\u201d Page 44.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Great Recession, Great Recovery?
