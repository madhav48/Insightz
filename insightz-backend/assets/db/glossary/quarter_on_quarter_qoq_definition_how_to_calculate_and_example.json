  "term": "Quarter on Quarter (QOQ): Definition, How to Calculate, and Example",
  "definition": "Quarter on quarter (QOQ) is a measuring technique that calculates the change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. The term is similar to theyear-over-year (YOY)measure, which compares the quarter of one year (such as the first quarter of 2024) to the same quarter of the previous year (the first quarter of 2023).\n\nThe measure gives investors and analysts an idea of how a company is growing over eachquarter.\n\nQOQ allows a business to monitor shorter-term changes and to\u00a0progress toward goals or benchmarks set for the year. It can provide valuable information as to how acompanyis performing and allow the company to respond and make process changes if required.\n\nOften, the QOQ measure is used to compareearningsbetween quarters. For example, Company ABC\u2019s first-quarter earnings were $1.50 per share, and its second-quarter earnings were $1.75 per share. By calculating the QOQ growth between quarters ($1.75 - $1.50/$1.50), it\u2019s clear that the company has grown its earnings by 16.6%, which is a positive indicator\u00a0forinvestors.\n\nWhen used in financial or accounting principles, a quarter\u00a0is a consecutive three-month period within the year. Traditionally, the first quarter (Q1) refers to January, February, and March. Each subsequent three-month period represents Q2, Q3, and Q4.\n\nWhen used as part of a QOQ analysis, a business would comparefinancialsfrom Q2 (April, May, June) to Q1 (January, February, March). This comparison varies from YOY, where the same quarter is compared from one year to the next. For example, Q1 of 2024\u00a0is compared to Q1 of 2023\u00a0in a YOY review.\n\nComparing quarters on a year-over-year (YOY) basis can be more effective than on a quarter-on-quarter (QOQ) basis, as it gives a broader picture of company health and is not impacted by seasonal issues.\n\nThere are circumstances where QOQ analysis may not provide a holistic view of\u00a0the health of an organization. For example, if an industry experiencesseasonal sales variance, such as landscapers or seasonal sellers, what may appear to be a downward trend may be an industry norm.\n\nThe same can apply if a business experiences higher earnings during a peak season that may reflect abnormally high growth from one quarter to the next. An organization may choose to adjust the figures seasonally and compensate for regular shifts in business, giving a more accurate picture throughout the year.\u00a0Since YOY analysis involves the examination of the same quarter from one year to the next, it does not typically\u00a0require a seasonal adjustment to provide valuable data.\n\nA company\u2019s earnings report from one quarter to the next can affect the market. A disappointing earnings report can cause the stock to plunge as investors try to sell off the stock before the price drops.\n\nIn 2018,Amazon\u2019s third-quarter earnings exceeded analysts\u2019 estimates, but Amazon\u2019s guidance for the fourth quarter fell short of expectations, and the company\u2019s stock price plunged in response to the announcement. The last quarter of the year includes the holidays and is typically Amazon\u2019s busiest season. Fourth-quarterrevenueguidance was significantly below the consensus and caused concern among shareholders. Amazon stock plunged by 10%, although it eventually recovered as investors priced in the news.\n\nQuarter on quarter (QOQ) compares performance change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. It reflects short-term changes in various metrics and can indicate company performance over two quarters.\n\nQOQ lets a company monitor shorter-term changes and progress toward goals or benchmarks set for the year. The measure can provide valuable information on a business\u2019s performance and allow the business to respond and make process changes if it has to.\n\nAn industry that experiences seasonal sales variance may not get an accurate picture of their well-being from QOQ analysis. A downward trend may be an industry norm. The same goes for a business that experiences higher earnings during a peak season that may reflect abnormally high growth from one quarter to the next.\n\nQuarter on quarter (QOQ) calculates the change between one fiscal quarter and the previous fiscal quarter. The measuring technique gives investors and analysts an idea of how a company is growing over each quarter.\n\nCNBC. \u201cAmazon Plunges 10% on Revenue and Guidance Miss.\u201d",
