  "term": "Special Economic Zone (SEZ) Meaning and Relation to FDI",
  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA special economic zone\u00a0(SEZ) is an\u00a0area\u00a0in a country that is designed to generate positive economic growth. An SEZ is normally subject to different and more favorable economic regulations compared to other\u00a0regions in the same country, including tax incentives and the opportunity to pay lower tariffs. SEZ\u00a0economic regulations tend to be conducive to\u2014and attract\u2014foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI refers to any investment made by a firm or individual in one country into business interests located in another country.\n\nSpecial economic zones are special areas designated within a country that have different business and trade regulations. They are normally established to facilitate rapideconomic growthand development in certain geographic regions.\n\nEconomic growth may come locally, regionally, and/or internationally. The growth that results from special economic zones is accomplished by leveraging tax incentives as a way of attracting foreign dollars through FDI and technological advancement.\n\nSEZs\u00a0may increase export levels for the implementing country and other countries that supply\u00a0it with intermediate products. However, there is a risk\u00a0that countries may abuse the system and use it to retainprotectionistbarriers in the form of taxes and fees. SEZs can also create a high level ofbureaucracydue to their regulatory requirements. This can have the effect of funneling money away from the system, making it less efficient.\n\nTypes of SEZs include free-trade zones, industrial parks, and specialized zones. We go into more detail about these and other types of SEZs below.\n\nWhile there are benefits for businesses, individuals, or entities operating within an\u00a0SEZ, the macroeconomic and socioeconomic benefits for a country using an\u00a0SEZ strategy are subject to debate.\n\nThe first SEZs appeared in the late 1950s inindustrialized countries. They were designed to attract foreign investment from multinational corporations. The first was at\u00a0Shannon Airport in Clare,\u00a0Ireland.In the 1970s, SEZs were also established in Latin American and East Asian countries. The most successful SEZs to date have been in China.\n\nThere were more than 7,000 SEZs as of 2022, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.They are found in every part of the world\u2014notably in developing and transitional economies that use them as a tool for industrialization.\n\nAs noted above, there are a number of different types of special economic zones. The following are some of the most common categories.\n\nWhile many countries have set up SEZs, China has been the most successful in using SEZs to attract foreigncapital. The first four SEZs in China were created in 1979 in the Southeastern coastal region: Shenzhen,\u00a0Zhuhai, and\u00a0Shantou\u00a0in Guangdong province, and\u00a0Xiamen in Fujian province.\n\nChina added Hainan Island to its list of SEZs\u00a0in 1983.The success of the original SEZs\u00a0prompted\u00a0the government to create 14 open coastal cities in 1984. These cities enjoy similar benefits as SEZs such as the power to approve investment projects, offer incentives to foreign investors, andimportequipment and technology tax-free.\n\nWithin China, the SEZs essentially act as liberal\u00a0economic environments that promote\u00a0innovation and advancement. The Chinese government continues to allow these areas to offer tax incentives to foreign investors as a way of further developing theinfrastructureof these regions.\n\nMainstream economists agree that the country's SEZs helped to liberalize the formerly traditional state. Without the SEZs, China may not have been able to successfully implement the same level of national reform.\n\nSpecial economic zones are designed to create and boost economic growth. One of their main goals is to capitalize on foreign direct investment. SEZs are specially designated areas that are clearly defined with physical barriers and management is done by a single authority. Users and investors within SEZs can take advantage of certain benefits, including favorable regulations and taxation.\n\nSome of the most common types of special economic zones are free-trade zones, export processing zones, industrial parks, and specialized zones. Many of these offer users tax incentives, such as exemption on duties and other fees, and access to foreign direct investment.\n\nSpecial economic zones are found all around the world. But some of the most successful ones are found in China. The country started to develop SEZs in the 1980s as a way to boost economic growth in order to take advantage of global capital as foreign firms and investors showed interest in the country's economic potential. The federal government revitalized existing SEZs and established new ones in the 1990s to continue fueling this growth.\n\nSpecial economic zones are widely used around the world as a way to boost economic growth. These areas are specially designed zones that promote investment, primarily through foreign dollars. SEZs provide incentives, such as favorable tax and tariff regulations. Some of the most common types of SEZs include free-trade zones and industrial parks, which you've probably come across in many major cities across the country.\n\nShannon Chamber. \"Shannon Free Zone.\"\n\nUNCTAD. \"New global alliance of special economic zones to boost development.\"\n\nBU Global Development Policy Center. \"The Political Economy of Special Economic Zones: The Cases of Ethiopia and Vietnam.\"\n\nClyde D.
