  "term": "Hedge Fund Manager: Definition, Strategies, and Compensation",
  "definition": "A hedge fund manager is an individual or financial firm that manages and makes investment decisions, and oversees\u00a0the operations of,\u00a0a hedge fund. Managing ahedge fundcan be an attractive career option because of its high earnings potential.\n\nTo be successful, a hedge fund manager must consider how to create and maintain acompetitive advantage, a clearly definedinvestment strategy, adequate capitalization, a marketing and sales plan, and a risk management strategy.\n\nHedge fund management firms are often owned by the managers in charge of a hedge fund portfolio. This means that they are entitled to a large percentage of the profits that the hedge fund makes.\n\nWhen investing in a hedge fund, investors fund themanagement feesthat cover the operating expenses, as well asperformance feesthat are usually distributed to the owners as profit.\n\nWhat sets hedge fund managers apart from other types of fund managers is the fact that the personal worth and funds of hedge fund managers are usually tied directly to the fund itself.\n\nThedutiesof a hedge fund manager involve:\n\nTop hedge fund managers hold some of the most well-paid positions in any industry, far outpacing CEOs of major companies. In fact, some of the highest-grossing managers make close to $4 billion a year.\n\nThis extraordinary compensation potential requires hedge fund managers to stay competitive, to consistently create winning investment strategies, and to make advantageous trade choices.\n\nNote that many hedge fund managers make much less than the top-paid managers, in some cases because their funds generate lower profits.\n\nIndividuals wishing to invest in hedge funds must meet income andnet worthrequirements. Hedge funds can be considered high risk because they pursueaggressive investment strategiesand are less regulated than many other types of investments.\n\nHedge fund managers can use multiple strategies to maximize returns for their firms and clients.\n\n1.One popular strategy is using something calledglobal macro investing. The idea is to invest in tandem with a large share of sizable position in markets that are dealing with predicting global macroeconomic trends.\n\nThis type of strategy gives hedge fund managers the necessary flexibility they need. But it is heavily dependent on excellent timing.\n\n2.Another popular tactic that has made multiple hedge fund managers billionaires is anevent-driven strategy. Managers look for attractive opportunities to capitalize on a corporate environment.\n\nExamples of this include mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies,\u00a0and shareholder buyback initiatives. Managers using this strategy seek to capitalize on any market inconsistencies. It's similar to using avalue investingapproach.\n\nHedge fund managers often go this route because of the vast resources they have behind them.\n\nAccording to an analysis by veteran business-to-business publisherInstitutional Investor, despite the tough year for the markets, \"2022 was a very good year for multistrategy, macro, trend-following, and fixed-income [hedge fund] managers.\"\n\nTwo and twenty(or \"2 and 20\") is a typical fee arrangement for hedge fund managers that is standard in the hedge fund industry. It is also common in venture capital and private equity.\n\nHedge fund management companies typically charge clients both a management and a performance fee. \"Two\" means 2% ofassets under management (AUM), and refers to the annual management fee charged by the hedge fund for managing assets.\n\n\"Twenty\" refers to the standard performance or incentive fee of 20% of the profits made by the fund, above a certain predefined benchmark.\n\nWhile this lucrative fee arrangement has resulted in many hedge fund managers becoming extremely wealthy, in recent years thefee structurehas come under fire from investors and politicians for varying reasons.\n\nSome hedge fund managers also have to contend with ahigh watermarkthat is applicable to their performance fee. A high watermark policy specifies that the fund manager will only be paid a percentage of the profits if the fund's net value exceeds its previous highest value.\n\nThis precludes the fund manager being paid large sums for poor performance and ensures that any losses must be made up before performance fees are paid out.\n\nIn 2022, the 25 highest-paid hedge fund managers made $21.5 billion (an average of approximately $860 million for each). The hedge fund manager who earned the most, Ken Griffin, banked $4.1 billion.\n\nThe median amount earned by hedge fund managers in 2022 was $570 million.\n\nBroadly speaking, both manage a portfolio of investments. But a hedge fund manager is responsible for the affairs, in their entirety, of a hedge fund and may be a limited partner in the fund. A portfolio manager is focused on making and managing investments in a portfolio, which could relate to the investments of an individual investor or a mutual fund. Plus, the portfolio manager typically isn't as geared toward the high risk strategies and investments that a hedge fund manager is.\n\nIt's a limited partnership of high-net-worth accredited investors that seeks above-average returns from actively managed investments and mandates non-traditional, high-risk positions to achieve them.\n\nNormally, hedge fund managers need, at minimum, a college degree in a relevant area of study, such as finance, as well aswork experience in the investment field. Undergraduate experience, for example, as an intern at a financial firm, is beneficial. An advanced degree, e.g., a Master of Finance, can also be an advantage for such job seekers. They'll require abusiness license to operate, and earning credentials are also valuable.\n\nA hedge fund manager is an individual or financial firm that is responsible for a hedge fund and for achieving the substantial profitability mandated by the partnership of investors behind it.\n\nSome hedge fund managers earn enormous amounts of money yearly\u2014from many hundreds of millions to over several billion dollars\u2014but it appears that most settle for far less.\n\nInstitutional Investor. \"The Rich List: The 22nd Annual Ranking of the Highest-Earning Hedge Fund Managers.\"\n\nIndeed. \"Portfolio Manager vs. Hedge Fund Manager: How They Differ.\"\n\nGlass Door. \"Hedge Fund Manager Salaries.\"",
