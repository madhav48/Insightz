A value trap can drop further after an investor buys into the company.\n\nA company trading at low earnings, cash flow, or book valuemultiplesfor an extended period is usually experiencing instability. Even if theprice of the stock appears attractive, the company data and fundamentals do not meet investor criteria.\n\nA company that does not reinvest profits with material improvements, research, development, processes, or contain costs could signal a value trap.

These situations commonly produce an unsupported but attractive yield.\n\nValue investing is investing in stocks whose price is significantly lower than their intrinsic value. Deep value investments are cheap stock purchases where investors disregard the quality aspects of the underlying companies.\n\nValue traps tend to mislead investors into trading at low levels that present buying opportunities.
