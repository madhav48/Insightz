  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAccidentaldeath benefitis\u00a0a payment due to thebeneficiaryof an accidental death insurance policy, which is often a clause or\u00a0rider connected to a life insurance policy. The accidental death benefit (ADB) life insurance policy usually pays in addition to the standard benefit payable if the insured died of natural causes.\n\nDepending on the policy\u2019s issuer, an accidental death benefit may extend up to a year after the initial accident occurs, provided that the accident led to the insured\u2019s death.\n\nAccidental death benefits are riders or provisions that may be added to basic life insurance policies at the request of the insured party. Some people add accidental death benefit riders to their policies to protect their beneficiaries if an accident occurs. This is important, as accidents are hard to predict and can lead to financial struggles if a sudden death occurs.\n\nAccidental death benefits are important for people\u00a0who work in or around potentially hazardous environments. Even those who drive more than average\u2014either professionally or as a commuter\u2014should consider accidental death benefit riders.\n\nAs an optional feature, the insured party must pay an additional fee on top of their regularpremiumsto purchase this benefit. Then, the accidental death benefit increases the payout to a policy\u2019s beneficiary. So, the beneficiary essentially receives the death benefit paid by the policy itself plus any additional accidental death benefit covered by the rider. These riders typically end once the insured person reaches\u00a0a certain age, such as 60, 70, or 80.\n\nInsurance companies define accidental death as an event that strictly occurs as a result of an accident. Deaths from car crashes, slips, choking, drowning, machinery, and any other situations that can\u2019t be controlled are deemed accidental. In the case of a fatal accident, death usually must occur within a period specified in the policy.\n\nSome policies\u2019 accidental death benefits may also cover dismemberment\u2014total or partial loss of limbs\u2014burns, instances of paralysis, and other similar cases. These riders are calledaccidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance.\n\nAccidents typically exclude things like acts of war and\u00a0death caused by illegal activities. Death from an illness is also excluded. Any hazardous hobbies that the insured regularly engages in\u2014race car driving, bungee jumping, or other risky activities\u2014are often excluded as well.\n\nWith a group life supplement, the\u00a0accidental death benefit\u00a0plan is included as part of agroup life insurancecontract, such as those offered by your employer. The benefit amount is usually the same as that of the group life benefit.\n\nA voluntary accidental death benefit\u00a0plan is offered to members of a group as a separate, elective benefit. Offered by your employer, premiums are your responsibility. You generally pay these premiums through regular payroll deductions. Employees are covered for accidents that occur while on the job. Policies pay out benefits forvoluntary accident insuranceeven if the insured party isn\u2019t at work.\n\nThe accidental death\u00a0benefit plan with travel accident insurance is provided through an employee benefit plan and provides supplemental accident protection to workers while they are traveling on company business. Unlike voluntary accident insurance, the employer usually pays the entire premium for this coverage.\n\nSome group accidental death benefit\u00a0plans also provide coverage fordependents. If you have a spouse or partner, or children who depend on your salary to pay bills and other costs, it may be a good idea to enroll in an accidental death benefit.\n\nThis additional insurance could help them out by providing money to pay bills, pay off a mortgage, or provide money to your children for future events, like college. In addition, if you co-own a business, your business partner could be listed on your insurance policy to cover any outstanding debts in the event of your death.\n\nAs a\u00a0hypothetical example, assume you have\u00a0a $500,000 life insurance policy with a $1 million accidental death benefit rider.\u00a0If you die due to a heart attack\u2014a natural cause\u2014the insurance company will pay your beneficiary $500,000.\u00a0If you\u00a0die as a result of a car accident, your\u00a0beneficiary will\u00a0receive the $500,000 life insurance benefit plus the $1 million\u00a0accidental death\u00a0benefit for a\u00a0totalpayoutof $1.5 million.\n\nInsurance companies consider accidental death to be an event that causes your death as the result of an accident. For example, most car crashes, falls down the stairs, machinery, choking, and even drowning are circumstances beyond your control, and thus counted as accidental.\n\nAccidental death and dismemberment insurance covers you in the case of accidental death, or if you lose a limb (or other significant injuries) in an accident that causes you to stop working. Besides being dismembered, the insurance may include workplace injuries, injuries caused by a fire or flood, accidents with firearms, or a serious fall.\n\nAccidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) and accidental death benefit (ADB) policies both pay a benefit. The main difference is that\u00a0an AD&D policy will pay if the insured is dismembered or injured, whereas the ADB only pays a benefit if the insured dies.\n\nAccidental death benefits are paid to beneficiaries of an accidental death insurance policy. Insurance companies often have strict perimeters of what constitutes an accidental death. Accidental death benefits are optional riders, so they aren\u2019t included in standard life insurance policies. These riders often end at a specific age, which is set by the insurance company. If you work in a dangerous environment, you may want to consider adding an accidental death benefit rider to your insurance policy.",
