  "term": "Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit (GLWB): Definition and How It Works",
  "definition": "Daniel has 10+ years of experience reporting on investments and personal finance for outlets like AARP Bulletin and Exceptional magazine, in addition to being a column writer for Fatherly.\n\nA guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) is ariderto avariable annuitythat provides a minimumpayoutlevel, even if market losses reduce the cash value of your contract. Most of these riders also allow you to make withdrawals from your cash value as needed. You typically pay for the GLWB rider with annual fees that can vary based on the issuer.\n\nAnannuityis a contract between the purchaser and the issuer. The purchaser makes a one-time lump sum payment or regular payments to the issuer. In exchange, the issuer makes periodic payments to theannuitantfor the remainder of their life or for a specific number of years. Sometimesthe benefits continue after the annuitant has died, typically for a surviving spouse.\n\nIf you buy afixed annuity, the issuer pays afixed interest rateon the money you\u2019ve paid. With a variable annuity, on the other hand,you can invest in the market through subaccounts. This feature offers greater growth potential, but also subjects you to potential losses. A GLWB is a way to mitigate that risk.\n\nThe GLWB rider ensures that you receive a minimum lifetime payment that essentially counteracts any losses in your subaccounts. Most issuers also allow you to make additional withdrawals from your cash value; however, these typically reduce the guaranteed withdrawal amount.\n\nVariable annuities have a cash value that\u2019s equal to the premiums you have paid plus or minus any market returns. With a GLWB rider, however, theannuity contracthas a separate benefit base\u2014sometimes called a withdrawal base\u2014that is used to calculate lifetime withdrawals.\n\nOnce you elect to receive your income stream, this benefit base is used to determine the amount of your minimum guaranteed withdrawal. Depending on the terms of the contract and your age, a certain percentage is applied to the benefit base to determine your guaranteed annual payment. It is usually determined by your age at the start ofannuitization.\n\nHere\u2019s an example: If you are 65 when you make your first withdrawal, your contract might stipulate a 5% withdrawal rate, whereas if you start receiving payouts at 70, your stipulated rate might be higher\u2014say, 5.25%.\n\nA key feature of GLWB riders is that your withdrawal amount is based on either the benefit base orthe cash value, whichever is higher when you start receiving guaranteed payments.For example, say you invested $50,000 in premiums and have a withdrawal rate of 5%, but your cash value is only $35,000 when you elect to annuitize, due to poor market performance. The issuer would take the higher of these two amounts, your benefit base of $50,000, to calculate the guaranteed minimum withdrawals. This means you would receive $2,500 per year ($50,000 \u00d7 0.05 withdrawal rate).\n\nGLWB riders may also allow you to make additional withdrawals from your cash value, even during theannuitization phase. However, doing so usually results in a reduction of your benefit base.\n\nFor example, a withdrawal of 20% of your cash value would lead to a 20% decrease in the guaranteed minimum payments for the remainder of your life. In the example above, such a withdrawal would decrease the GLWB payment to $2,000 ($40,000 \u00d7 0.05 withdrawal rate).\n\nMost insurance companies charge an annual fee for taking on the market risk that would ordinarily be borne by the customer.Those costs can vary widely, making it important to carefully review annuity documents before purchasing one.\n\nSome GLWB riders come with additional benefits that can potentially increase the amount of your guaranteed withdrawal. The issuer may charge an additional fee or roll it into the fee for the rider itself. Among the more common examples are:\n\nThe insurer may offer a minimumrate of returnto your benefit base. The withdrawal amount is based on the higher of your benefit base (plus minimum return) or the cash value.\n\nSuppose, for example, that you paid $50,000 in premiums but had a guaranteed 4% rate of return, regardless of market conditions. In two years, that base would go up to $54,080 (add $2,000 after the first year, then $2,080 after the second year).\n\nIf the cash value remained at $50,000, the issuer would use the benefit base to calculate the lifetime payments. Assuming a 5% withdrawal percentage, you would receive annual payouts of $2,704 ($54,080 \u00d7 0.05 withdrawal rate).\n\nIf the rider has a step-up feature, the insurer will periodically compare the current cash value in the account with the amount initially used to determine the GLWB. If the cash balance is higher, it will adjust the benefit accordingly.\n\nSuppose, for instance, that the original withdrawal amount was based on a benefit base of $50,000, with a 5% withdrawal rate. That made the original guaranteed withdrawal $2,500 per year. However, if the cash balance five years later is now $60,000, then the 5% withdrawal rate would be applied to that higher amount. Thus, going forward, you would receive $3,000 per year ($60,000 \u00d7 0.05 withdrawal rate).\n\nThe primary benefit of a GLWB rider is that it safeguards you from the possibility of receiving a lower lifetime payout if the market takes a hit. In addition, the rider allows you to access your cash value if you need it, which you cannot do with a traditional annuity because it ties up the money you put into the contract once annuitization begins.\n\nThe downside, of course, is the additional cost of purchasing this protection. Those who start paying into the annuity well before they annuitize have a lower exposure to market risk as it is\u2014that is, they have more time for the stocks and bonds in their subaccounts to recover. Therefore, customers with a longertime horizonmay want to avoid the extra fee that comes with a GLWB rider.\n\nA guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) is a rider that you may be able to add to your variable annuity contract. It guarantees a minimum payout level, even if market losses reduce the cash value of the contract. Most riders also allow you to make withdrawals from your cash value as needed.\n\nThe obvious pitfall to a GLWB rider on an annuity is the cost. It\u2019s important toread the annuity documents carefully before you purchasethis coverage.\n\nThe step-up feature provides a larger guaranteed benefit each year if the cash value from the annuity\u2019s subaccounts has grown. The annuity issuer compares the original benefit base amount with the current cash value every few years. If the latter is bigger, it will use that figure as the basis for future guaranteed benefits.\n\nA guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB) is a rider on a variable annuity that allows withdrawals from the account without penalties. It also ensures that you receive a certain minimum payment, regardless of market performance. However, these benefits come at a cost.\n\nGuardian Investment & Accounting, via Broadridge Advisor Solutions. \u201cGuaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Annuity Rider.\u201d",
