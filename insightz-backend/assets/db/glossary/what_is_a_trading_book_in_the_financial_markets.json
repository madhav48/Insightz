  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA trading book is the portfolio offinancial instrumentsheld by a brokerage or bank. Financial instruments in a trading book are purchased or sold for several reasons. For example, they might be bought or sold to facilitate trading actions for customers to profit from trading spreads between the bid and ask prices or to hedge against different forms of risk.\n\nTrading books can range in size from hundreds of thousands of dollars to tens of billions depending on the size of the institution.\n\nMost institutions employ sophisticated riskmetricsto manage and mitigate risk in their trading books. Trading books function as a form of accounting ledger by tracking the securities held by the institution that are regularly bought and sold. Additionally, trading history information is tracked within the trading book by creating a simple way to review the institution's previous activities of associated securities. This differs from a banking book as securities in a trading book are not intended to be held until maturity, while the securities in the banking book will be held long-term.\n\nSecurities held in a trading book must be eligible for active trading.\n\nTrading books are subject to gains and losses as prices of the included securities change. Since these securities are held by the financial institution, and not by individual investors, these gains and losses impact the financial fitness of the institution directly.\n\nThe trading book can be a source of massive losses within a financial institution. Losses arise due to the extremely high degrees ofleverageemployed by an institution to build the trading book. Another source of trading book losses is disproportionate and highly concentrated wagers on specific securities or market sectors by errant orrogue traders.\n\nTrading book losses can have a cascading, global effect when they hit numerous financial institutions at the same time, such as during the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) collapse, the Russian debt crisis of 1998, and theLehman Brothersbankruptcy in 2008. The globalcredit crunchandfinancial crisisof 2008 was significantly attributable to the hundreds of billions of losses sustained by globalinvestment banksin the mortgage-backed securities portfolios held within their trading books. During that crisis,Value at Risk(VaR) models were used to quantify trading risks in trading books. Banks transferred their risk from the banking book to trading books because VaR values were low.\n\nAttempts to disguise mortgage-backed security trading book losses during the financial crisis ultimately resulted in criminal charges being brought against a former vice president of Credit Suisse Group.In 2014, Citigroup Inc. purchased the commodity trading books held by Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse participated in the sale in response to regulatory pressure and their intent to lower their involvement in commodities investing.\n\nAll of a financial institution's tradeable assets are listed in the trading book.\n\nThe trading book lists assets intended for short-term trading, while the bank book lists all other assets intended for earning interest.\n\nThe trading book is considered a legal document that can be used as evidence in court and as a planning tool for future trades.\n\nA trading book is an accounting ledger used by a brokerage or financial institution to account for its portfolio, or all of its tradeable assets. Depending on the size of the institution, these portfolios can track billions of dollars in investments.\n\nUnited States Department of Justice. \"Former Credit Suisse Vice President Sentenced In Manhattan Federal Court In Connection With Scheme To Hide Losses In Mortgage-Backed Securities Trading Book.\"\n\nReuters. \"Citi Buys Credit Suisse Commodities Trading Book.\"",
