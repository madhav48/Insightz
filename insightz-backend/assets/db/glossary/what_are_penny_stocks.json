  "term": "What Are Penny Stocks?",
  "definition": "A penny stock typically refers to the stock of a small company that trades for less than $5 per share. Though some penny stocks trade on large exchanges such as theNew York Stock Exchange(NYSE), most trade via over-the-counter (OTC) transactions through the electronicOTC Bulletin Board(OTCBB) or through the privately-ownedOTC Markets Group.\n\nThere is no trading floor for OTC transactions. Quotations are also all done electronically.\n\nIn the past, penny stocks were considered any stocks that traded for less than one dollar per share. The U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC) has modified the definition to include all shares trading below five dollars. The SEC is an independent\u00a0federal government agency responsible for protecting investors by maintaining the proper and orderly functioning of thesecuritiesmarkets.\n\nPenny stocks are usually associated with small companies with a lack of liquidity, meaning that there are few ready buyers in the marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to sell stock since there may not be enough buyers. Because of the low liquidity, investors might have difficulty finding a price that accurately reflects the market.\n\nDue to their lack of liquidity, wide bid-ask spreads or price quotes, and small company sizes, penny stocks are generally considered highly speculative. In other words, investors could lose a sizable amount or all of their investment.\n\nPenny stocks often represent growing companies with limited cash and resources. Since these are primarily small companies, penny stocks are most suitable for investors who have ahigh tolerance for risk.\n\nTypically, penny stocks have a higher level of volatility, resulting in a higher potential for reward and, thus, a higher level of inherent risk. Investors may lose their entire investment on a penny stock, or more than their investment if theybuy on margin, which means the investor borrowed funds from a bank or broker to purchase the shares.\n\nInvestors should consider the heightened risks associated with penny stocks. For example, an investor should have astop-loss orderpredetermined before entering a trade and know what price level to exit if the market moves against them. Stop-loss orders set a price limit that, once reached, will trigger an automatic sale of the securities.\n\nAlthough penny stocks can have explosive gains, it is essential to have realistic expectations and understand that penny stocks are high-risk investments with low trading volumes.\n\nDue to their low volume, penny stocks tend to be more volatile than established equities. This means high opportunities for both gains and losses, and investors should be careful to understand both the risks and benefits.\n\nPenny stocks do provide some small businesses with a way to access funding from the public. These companies may use this platform as a starting block to move into a larger marketplace.\n\nAlso, since they sell at such low prices, there is room for significant upside. Some companies, such as Amazon (AMZN) originated as penny stocks but later grew into sizableblue-chipcompanies.\n\nA blue chip is a nationally recognized, well-established, and financially sound company. Blue chips generally sell high-quality, widely accepted products and services. Blue-chip companies typically have a history of weathering downturns and operate profitablyin the face of adverse economic conditions, which helps to contribute to their long record of stable and reliable growth.\n\nHowever, some factors exacerbate the risk associated with investing in or trading penny stocks. These securities are usually riskier than more established companies.\n\nWhen considering options for potential investments, it's important to have enough information to make an informed decision. For some penny stocks, information on corporate performance can be very difficult to find. When this is the case, the information that is available about them may not come from credible sources.\n\nStocks traded on the OTCBB carry the \"OB\" suffix to their symbol. These companies file financial statements with the SEC. However, companies listed on thepink sheetsare not required to file with the SEC. As such these businesses do not receive the same public scrutiny or regulation as the stocks represented on the NYSE, the Nasdaq, andother markets.\n\nStocks on the OTCBB and pink sheets do not have to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain available for sale through OTC exchanges. Once a company can no longer maintain its listing position on one of the major exchanges, the company can move to one of the smaller OTC listing exchanges. Minimum standards can act as a safety cushion for some investors. When a company is not subject to higher standards, investing in that company becomes much riskier.\n\nMany of the companies considered to be penny stocks could be newly formed, and some could be approachingbankruptcy. These companies will generally have poor track records or no track record at all. As you can imagine, this lack of historical information makes it difficult to determine a stock's potential.\n\nStocks that trade infrequently do not have muchliquidity. As a result, it is possible that investors won't be able to sell the stock once it is acquired. The investors might need to lower their price until it is considered attractive to another buyer.\n\nLow liquidity levels also provide opportunities for some traders to manipulate stock prices. Thepump and dumpscheme is a popular trading scam to lure investors into buying a stock. Large amounts of a penny stock are purchased followed by a period when the stock is hyped up or pumped up.\n\nOnce other investors rush to buy the stock, the scammers sell their shares. Once the market realizes there was no fundamental reason for the stock to rise, investors rush to sell and can take on heavy losses.\n\nOffer a place for small companies to gain access public funding.\n\nIn some cases, penny stocks may provide a method to gain access to larger marketplace listing.\n\nWith a lower price, penny stocks allow for significant upside in share appreciation.\n\nPenny stocks lack a liquid market with few buyers, perhaps even after their price has increased.\n\nThere is limited information available on the company's financial record.\n\nPenny stocks have a high probability of fraud and bankruptcy of the underlying company.\n\nWhile penny stocks are volatile, there are some cautions that an investor can take to reduce their downside risk. One is to conduct proper due diligence: Since penny stocks tend to trade in venues with lower entry requirements, investors should take extra care to read the company's statements and ensure that the company is financially sound.\n\nIt is also important to rely onreputable stockbrokers. While there are scams to watch out for, most of them are promoted by dubious emails and cold calls. A reputable broker should be able to provide high-quality written research to back up any investment claims.\n\nFinally, as with any speculative investment, never put in more money than you can afford to lose. While you may make a profit by day trading, the returns are much more steady with established, large-cap equities.\n\nDespite the risks, penny stocks can be profitable for a cautious or thorough investor. The key is to avoid certain fallacies that are common among speculative investments, such as the belief that they have the opportunity to make large gains. While this is true, they are equally likely to score large losses.\n\nAnother important fallacy to avoid is the low-price fallacy, which holds that low-priced securities are inherently \"cheaper\" than higher-priced ones. However, this does not account for factors like market capitalization or liquidity. Even if a certain stock doubles in price, it may be impossible to sell a large number of stocks without causing priceslippage.\n\nThough there is no fool-proof strategy for knowing which penny stocks are fraudulent, the SEC recommends that investors heed the following warning signs in a company's record:SEC trading suspensions, large assets but small revenues, financial statements containing unusual items in the footnotes, odd auditing issues, and large insider ownership.\n\nCalifornia resident Zirk de Maison\u00a0created nearly half of a dozen shell companies and offered them as penny stocks to investors between 2008 and 2013, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n\nDe Maison told investors that the companies engaged in a variety of businesses, such as gold mining and diamond trading when, in fact, they did nothing. He sold the stocks in \"boiler rooms,\" offices wherebrokers use high-pressure tacticsto push people into buying stocks by promising large profits.\u00a0In 2015, de Maison and seven other perpetrators were found guilty of securities fraud and sentenced to federal prison.\n\nSmall companies andstartupstypically issue stock as a means of raising capital to grow the business. Although the process is lengthy, issuing stock is often one of the quickest and most effective ways for a startup company to obtain capital.\n\nA\u00a0penny stock, like any other publicly traded stock, is created through a process called an initial public offering or IPO. To be listed on the OTCBB the company must first file a registration statement with the SEC or file stating the offering qualifies for an exemption from registration. It must also check state securities laws in the locations it plans to sell the stock. Once approved, the company may begin the process of soliciting orders from investors.\n\nFinally, the company can apply to have the stock listed on a larger exchange, or it can trade on the over-the-counter market.\n\nAs with other new offerings, the first step is hiring an underwriter, usually an attorney or investment bank specializing in securities offerings. The company's offering either needs to be registered with the SEC, according to Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933, or file underRegulation Dif exempt. If the company is required to register, Form 1-A, the registration statement, must be filed with the SEC along with the company's financial statements and proposed sales materials.\n\nThe financial statements need to remain available for the public to review, and timely reports must be filed with the SEC to maintain the public offering. Once approved by the SEC, orders for shares may be solicited from the public by accompanying sales materials and disclosures, such as aprospectus.\n\nAfter initial orders are collected and the stock is sold to investors, a registered offering can begin trading in the secondary market by listing on an exchange like the NYSE, Nasdaq, or trade over-the-counter. Many penny stocks wind up trading via OTC due to the\u00a0strictrequirements\u00a0for listingon larger exchanges.\n\nSometimes companies make an additional secondary market offering after the IPO, which dilutes the existing shares but gives the company access to more investors and increased capital. Furthermore, it is mandatory that the companies continue to publicly provide updated financial statements to keep investors informed and continue to be quoted on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board.\n\nPenny stocks are considered highly speculative investments. To protect investors, the SEC andFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA) have rules\u00a0to regulate the trading of penny stocks. All\u00a0broker-dealers\u00a0must comply with Section 15(h) of the\u00a0Securities Exchange Act of 1934\u00a0and the accompanying rules to be eligible to handle penny stock transactions.\n\nPenny stocks can be traded after hours, and since many significant market movements can happen after exchanges\u00a0close, penny stocks are subject tovolatilefluctuations after-hours. If penny stock investors execute buy or sell trades after-hours, they may be able to sell shares for very high prices or purchase shares for very low prices.\n\nHowever, even the best penny stocks are subject to low\u00a0liquidity\u00a0and inferior reporting. Also, if a penny stock does spike after hours, an investor looking to sell the stock might have a hard time finding a buyer. Penny stocks infrequently trade, even more so after market hours, which can make it difficult to buy and sell after hours.\n\nMultiple events can trigger the transition of a penny stock to a regular stock. The company can issue new securities in an offering that is registered with the SEC, or it can register an existing class of securities with the regulatory body.\n\nBoth types of transactions automatically require the firm to adhere to periodic reporting, including disclosures to investors about its business activities, financial conditions, and company management unless there is an\u00a0exemption. These filings also mandate\u00a010-Q\u00a0quarterly reports,the annual Form\u00a010-K, and periodic Form\u00a08-K\u00a0reports, which detail unexpected and significant events.\n\nIn some instances, there are additional conditions that will require a company to file reports with the SEC. Reports must be filed if a company has either at least 2,000 investors, more than 500 investors that can\u2019t be categorized as\u00a0accredited investors, and possesses more than US$10 million in assets.\n\nUsually, companies with no more than $10 million in assets and fewer than 2,000 recorded shareholders don\u2019t have to adhere to reporting guidelines under the SEC.Interestingly enough, some companies opt for transparency by filing the same types of reports that other, perhaps more reputable, firms are required to do.\n\nMost penny stocks don\u2019t trade on major market exchanges. However, there are some large companies, based on market capitalization, that trade below $5 per share on the main exchanges like the Nasdaq.\n\nOne example of a penny stock listed on the Nasdaq is Catalyst Pharmaceuticals Inc. (CPRX), a small biopharmaceutical company based in Coral Gables, Florida. As of Jan. 7, 2021, the stock price is $3.55 per share. In the last 12 months, the share price has fluctuated between $2 and $5. On Aug. 10, 2020, the stock closed at $4.26; however, the next day the price fell to $3.34 a drop of nearly 22%.\n\nAlthough there can be sizable gains in trading penny stocks, there are also equal or larger risks of losing a significant amount of an investment in a short period.\n\nPenny stocks are traded on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) or the OTC Markets Group. They are also available to trade through a brokerage account, such as Fidelity or Charles Schwab.\n\nYou can buy penny stocks on Fidelity by searching for companies that trade for less than $5 per share. Note that those trading penny stocks must first submit a form acknowledging that they understand the risks of penny stock trading.\n\nYou canfind penny stockson Robinhood using the search function, and setting a filter for only those companies trading for less than $5 per share. Note that since Robinhood does not charge commissions, penny stock trades can be potentially more profitable than a commission-based broker.\n\nPenny stocks refer to shares in companies with a low price and low trading volume. Because these markets have low liquidity, there is also high volatility. This means more opportunities for large profits\u2014or losses.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Microcap Stock: A Guide for Investors.\"\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation. \"Penny Stock Fraud Nets Millions.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Penny Stock Rules.\"\n\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations. \"\u00a7240.15g-9 Sales Practice Requirements for Certain Low-Priced Securities.\"\n\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations. \"\u00a7240.15g-2\u00a0Penny Stock Disclosure Document Relating To the Penny Stock Market.\"\n\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations. \"\u00a7240.15g-3\u00a0Broker or Dealer Disclosure of Quotations and Other Information Relating To the Penny Stock Market.\"\n\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations. \"\u00a7240.15g-4\u00a0Disclosure of Compensation To Brokers or Dealers.\"\n\nElectronic Code of Federal Regulations. \"\u00a7240.15g-6 Account Statements for Penny Stock Customers.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Exchange Act Reporting and Registration.\"\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Catalyst Pharmaceuticals, Inc.\"\n\nFidelity Investments. \"Investing in Penny Stocks.\"",
