  "term": "Cost of Debt: What It Means and Formulas",
  "definition": "A company's cost of debt is the amount it pays in interest on debts used to finance its operations.\n\nThe cost of debt is the total interest expense paid for borrowing money. It is the effective interest rate that a company owes on any liabilities such as loans.\n\nThe size of the cost of debt depends on the borrower's creditworthiness, so higher costs generally mean the borrower is considered by lenders to be relatively risky.\n\nCost of debt can refer to either before-tax or after-tax cost of debt.\n\nDebtis money owed by one person or entity to another. Business debt is unavoidable for most companies. Companies, like individuals, use debt to make large purchases or investments.\n\nFor corporations. debt is part of theircapital structures. Capital structure is the mix of debt and equity that a firm uses to finance its operations and fund its growth. The debt might consist of bonds, loans, or a mix of both.\n\nA company's cost of debt is the overall rate being paid by a company to use these types ofdebt financing. This gives investors an idea of the company\u2019s risk level compared to others, as riskier companies generally have a higher cost of debt.\n\nThe cost of debt is generally lower thancost of equity.\n\nThere are a couple of different ways to calculate a company\u2019s cost of debt, depending on the information available.\n\nOne way to calculate the cost of debt is by using the formula for the after-tax cost of debt:\n\nTherisk-free rate of returnis the theoretical\u00a0rate of return\u00a0of an investment with zero risk, most commonly associated with U.S. Treasury bonds.\n\nA credit spread is the difference in yield between a U.S. Treasury bond and anotherdebt securityof the same maturity but different credit quality.\n\nThis formula is useful because it takes into account fluctuations in the economy, as well as company-specific debt usage and credit rating. If the company has more debt or a lowcredit rating, then its credit spread will be higher.\n\nFor example, say the risk-free rate of return is 1.5% and the company\u2019s credit spread is 3%. Its pretax cost of debt is 4.5%. If its tax rate is 30%, then the after-tax cost of debt is 3.15%. We can calculate this in the following way:\n\n[ ( 0.015 + 0.03 ) x ( 1 - 0.3 ) ]\n\nAnother way to calculate the cost of debt is to determine the total amount of interest paid on each debt for the year.\n\nThe interest rate that a company pays on its debts includes both the risk-free rate of return and thecredit spreadfrom the formula above because lenders take both into account when determining an interest rate.\n\nOnce the company has its total interest paid for the year, it divides this number by the total of all of its debt. This is the company\u2019s average interest rate on all of its debt.\n\nFor example, say a company has a $1 million loan with a 5% interest rate and a $200,000 loan with a 6% rate. The average interest rate and its pretax cost of debt is 5.17%. This is calculated as follows:\n\nThe company\u2019s tax rate is 30%, which means its after-tax cost of debt is 3.62%. To calculate this, we use the following formula:\n\nThe cost of debt before taking taxes into account is called the before-tax cost of debt. The after-tax cost of debt factors in taxation. The key difference lies in the fact thatinterest expensesare tax-deductiblebusiness expenses.\n\nSince the interest paid on debts is often treated favorably by U.S.tax codes, the tax deductions due to outstanding debts can lower the effective cost of debt paid by a borrower.\n\nThe after-tax cost of debt is the interest paid on debt less any income tax savings due to deductible interest expenses. To calculate the after-tax cost of debt, subtract a company\u2019s effective tax rate from one, and multiply the difference by its cost of debt.\n\nThe company\u2019smarginal tax rateis not used. Instead, the company\u2019s state and federal tax rates are added together to ascertain its effective tax rate.\n\nFor example, if a company\u2019s only debt is abondthat it issued with a 5% rate, then its pretax cost of debt is 5%. If its effective tax rate is 30%, then the difference between 100% and 30% is 70%, and 70% of the 5% is 3.5%. The after-tax cost of debt is 3.5%.\n\nThe rationale behind this calculation is based on the tax savings that the company receives from claiming its interest as a business expense.\n\nUsing the example, imagine the company issued $100,000 in bonds at a 5% rate with annual interest payments of $5,000. It claims this amount as an expense, which lowers the company\u2019s income by $5,000. As the company pays a 30% tax rate, it saves $1,500 in taxes by writing off its interest. As a result, the company effectively only pays $3,500 on its debt.\n\nThis equates to a 3.5% interest rate on its debt.\n\nBusinesses can reduce the cost of debt in the same ways that individuals can. The following are just a few of the ways to do so:\n\nSuppose you run a small business and you have two loans that are helping finance the enterprise. The first is a loan worth $250,000 through a major financial institution. The second is a $150,000 loan through a private investor. The first loan has an interest rate of 5% and the second one has a rate of 4.5%.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total amount of interest you'll pay each year on both of these loans:\n\nWe can add these two figures together to get the total annual interest, which is $19,250.\n\nIn order to calculate the effective rate before taxes, we divide this figure by the total amount of the debt:\n\n$19,250$400,000=0.0481\\begin{aligned}\\frac{\\$19,250}{\\$400,000} = 0.0481\\end{aligned}$400,000$19,250\u200b=0.0481\u200b\n\nTherefore, the effective before-tax rate of these debts is 4.81%\n\nLenders require that borrowers pay back the principal amount of debt plus interest. The interest rate, or yield, demanded by creditors is the cost of debt.\n\nThe interest repays the lender for thetime value of money(TVM), inflation, and the risk that the loan will not be repaid. It also accounts for theopportunity costsassociated with the money not being invested elsewhere.\n\nSeveral factors can increase the cost of debt, depending on the level of risk to the lender. These include a longer payback period, since the longer the payback period is the greater the time value of money and opportunity costs. The riskier the borrower is, the greater the cost of debt since there is a higher chance that the borrower will default.\n\nUnsecured debts have higher costs than loans that includecollateral.\n\nA mix of debt and equity capital provides businesses with the money they need to maintain their day-to-day operations.\n\nEquity capital tends to be more expensive for companies and does not involve a favorable tax treatment. Too much debt financing will damage creditworthiness and increase the risk of default or bankruptcy.\n\nGiven these factors, businesses strive to optimize theirweighted average cost of capital(WACC) across debt and equity.\n\nTheagency cost of debtis the conflict that arises between shareholders and debtholders of a public company when debtholders place limits on the use of the firm\u2019s capital if they believe that management will take actions that favor equity shareholders instead of debtholders.\n\nIn response, debtholders will place covenants on the use of capital, such as adherence to certain financial metrics which, if broken, allows the debtholders to call back their capital.\n\nDebt is unavoidable for most people and businesses. But it comes at a price. This is referred to as the cost of debt.\n\nThe cost of debt is calculated by multiplying the value of a loan by the annual interest rate. To determine theeffective interest rate, add together all that interest by the total amount of debt.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Spread the Word: What You Need to Know About Bond Spreads.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 505, Interest Expense.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business.\" Pages 34-35.",
