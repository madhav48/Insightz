  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA long-tail liability is a type of liability that carries a long settlement period. Long-tail liabilities are likely to result in highincurred but not reported (IBNR)claims, because it may take a long period of time for the claims to be settled.\n\nWhether a settlement period for an insurance claim is considered a long-tail\u00a0liability or short term\u00a0varies according to the type of risk being covered.\u00a0Property insurance claims tend to be settled relatively quickly, while liability insurance claims are often\u00a0classified as long-tail liabilities.\n\nLiability insurance providers often see new claims being filed a long time after the claim event occurred. The long settlement period or long-tail liability can occur for a variety of reasons, including:\n\nInsurance companies that offer coverage for risks that are considered long-tail may have higherinvestment income ratios(net investment income / earned premiums) than companies that offer coverage for short-term liabilities. The investment income ratio is used to determine an insurance company\u2019s profitability. Insurance companies typically invest the premiums they receive from their customers. Policies that cover long-tail risks have a larger gap between the time premiums are collected versus when claims are paid. As a result, long-tail insurance providers have more time to invest their premiums, allowing them more time to earn a higher rate of return.\n\nHowever, policies covering long-tail liabilities tend to have higherloss ratios(losses incurred divided by earned premiums) and highercombined ratios(losses and loss adjustment expenses divided by earned premium). The combined ratio also helps to determine the profitability of an insurer. The ratio includes the premiums collected, claims paid, and any claim-related expenses. A combined ratio below 100% indicates that the insurer is making a profit while a ratio above 100% means the company is paying out more in claims than its collecting in premiums.\n\nSince it can be years, or even decades, before a claim is made and makes its way through courts, proper record keeping is imperative. Companies that face the potential of\u00a0long-tail liability claims should be careful with old records and keep them until an effort has been made to determine if insurance policies, or evidence of insurance policies, is among them.\n\nIf a company is unable to locate an old liability policy, it\u00a0must rely instead on secondary\u00a0evidence\u00a0to show that a\u00a0policy existed\u00a0and that it was lost or destroyed without intent to defraud the insurer.\u00a0Such evidence could\u00a0include\u00a0corporate minutes, accounting ledgers, annual reports, internal memoranda, transactional records, and even personal appointment calendars\u2013but nothing is more important than locating the policy number itself.\n\nAlthough the type of claim and the length of the settlement process can vary, below are some of the most common long-tail liability claims.",
