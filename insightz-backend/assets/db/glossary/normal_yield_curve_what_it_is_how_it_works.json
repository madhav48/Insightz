  "term": "Normal Yield Curve: What it is, How it Works",
  "definition": "The normal yield curve is a yield curve in whichshort-term debtinstruments have a lower yield thanlong-term debtinstruments of the same credit quality. This gives the yield curve an upward slope. This is the most often seen yield curve shape, and it's sometimes referred to as the \"positive yield curve.\"\n\nAnalysts look to the slope of the yield curve for clues about how future short-term interest rates will trend. When there is an upward sloping yield curve, this typically indicates an expectation across financial markets of higher interest rates in the future; a downward sloping yield curve predicts lower rates.\n\nThis yield curve is considered \"normal\" because the market usually expects more compensation for greaterrisk. Longer-term bonds are exposed to more risk such as changes in interest rates and an increased exposure to potentialdefaults. Also,investingmoney for a long period of time means an investor is unable to use the money in other ways, so the investor is compensated for this through thetime value of moneycomponent of the yield.\n\nIn a normal yield curve, the slope will move upward to represent the higher yields often associated with longer-term investments. These higher yields are compensating for the increased risk normally involved in long-term ventures and the lower risks associated with short-term investments.\n\nThe shape of this curve is referred to as normal, over the additionally applicable term of positive, in that it represents the expected shift in yields as maturity dates extend out in time. It is most commonly associated with positiveeconomic growth.\n\nTheroll-down return strategyused by bond traders utilizes the normal yield curve and the associated bond prices. Also known asriding the curve, the stragety works in a stable rate environment. As a bond moves towards maturity, the yield will decline but the price will increase. Traders hope to capture the magic window of opportunity when they can sell their long-term bond holdings and profit on the price increase from the reduced risk.\n\nThe yield curve represents the changes ininterest ratesassociated with a particular security based on the length of time until maturity. Unlike other metrics, the yield curve is not produced by a single entity or government. Instead, it is set by measuring the feel of the market at the time, often referring to investor knowledge to help create the baseline. The direction of the yield curve is considered a solid indicator regarding the current direction of an economy andcan be easily charted.\n\nYield curves can also remain flat or become inverted. In the first instance, the flat curve demonstrates the returns on shorter and longer term investments are essentially the same. Often, this curve is seen as an economy approaches a recession because fearful investors will move their funds into lower risk options, driving up the price and lowering the overall yield.\n\nInverted yield curves present a point where short-term rates are more favorable than long-term rates. Its shape is inverted when compared to a normal yield curve, representing significant changes in market and investor behaviors. At this point,a recessionis generally seen as imminent if it is not already occurring.",
