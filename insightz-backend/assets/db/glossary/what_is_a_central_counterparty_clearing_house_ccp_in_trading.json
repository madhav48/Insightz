  "term": "What Is a Central Counterparty Clearing House (CCP) in Trading?",
  "definition": "A central counterparty clearing house (CCP) is an entity that facilitates trading in various European derivatives and equities markets.\n\nA central counterparty clearing house (CCP) is an entity that facilitates trading in Europeanderivativesand equities markets. Typically operated by the major banks in each country, CCPs are a crucial part of these markets, reducing the counterparty, operational, settlement, market, legal, and default risks for traders.\n\nA CCP is a particular type of clearing house. While the latter also facilitates trading, CCPs take an additional step and must agree to the terms before they clear the transaction. In the U.S., the equivalent of a CCP is a derivatives clearing organization (DCO) or derivatives clearinghouse. These are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and include the Options Clearing Corporation and Chicago Mercantile Exchange Clearing.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nCentral counterparty clearing houses (CCPs) perform two main tasks as intermediaries in transactions: clearing and settlement. As counterparties to the buyers and the sellers, CCPs guarantee the terms of a trade\u2014even if one party defaults on the agreement. CCPs bear the lion's share of the buyers' and sellers'credit riskwhen clearing and settling market transactions.\n\nThe CCP collects money from each buyer and seller to cover potential losses incurred by failing to follow through on an agreement. In such cases, the CCP replaces the trade at the market price. Monetary requirements are based on each trader\u2019s exposure and open obligations.\n\nTo protect privacy, CCPs shield the associated traders\u2019 identities from one another. CCPs also protect trading firms against default from buyers and sellers who are matched by an electronicorder bookand whose creditworthiness is unknown. In addition, CCPs reduce the number of transactions that are being settled. This helps smooth operations while reducing the value of the obligations, which helps money move more efficiently among traders.\n\nIn the U.S., the equivalent of a CCP is known as a DCO or a derivatives clearinghouse and is regulated by the CFTC.\n\nDCOs are critical players in keeping commodities and derivatives markets in the U.S. stable and trustworthy. As defined by theCFTC, a DCO is an entity that enables parties to substitute the DCO's credit for their own through novation (the legal substitution of one party for another in a contract). Think of them as financial middlemen who solve a crucial problem\u2014they bring trust to a system where trades are done without credit checks or most often without even knowing who the other party is. When two people make a deal involving derivatives, a DCO ensures everyone holds up their end of the bargain.\n\nThey do this by becoming a stand-in for both parties, taking on the responsibility for making the deal go through even if one side can't or won't pay up. This process, which the CFTC oversees, helps reduce risk and brings far more trading into the market.\n\nDCOs are particularly important in the derivatives market, where they must register with the CFTC before providing clearing services for futures contracts, options on futures, or swaps. DCOs must meet stringent regulations to protect market participants and maintain market stability.\n\nTo obtain and maintain registration, DCOs must follow 17 \"core principles\" established in theCommodity Exchange Act.They cover a wide range of operational and risk management requirements, such as the following:\n\nDCOs must maintain complete records, publish their rules and operating procedures, and participate in information-sharing agreements. These requirements promotetransparencyand allow for effective oversight by regulators.\n\nThe CFTC may exempt a DCO from registration for clearing swaps if it determines that the DCO is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision by authorities in its home country. This provision recognizes the global nature of derivatives markets while ensuring consistent standards across borders.\n\nCCPs have long been a cornerstone of risk management in European and U.S. financial markets (the latter through DCOs). As blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies reshape the financial landscape, CCPs are adapting to this new paradigm while also changing their traditional models.\n\nIn traditional markets, CCPs act as intermediaries between buyers and sellers, guaranteeing trades even if one party defaults. This system has proved effective in mitigating counterparty risk and enhancing market stability. However, the decentralized nature ofblockchaintechnology has suggested a possible advance over the CCP model, blockchain proponents have argued.\n\nIn 2015,clearinghousesfrom several nations joined forces to create aDavos-formed think tank, the Post Trade Distributed Ledger Group (PTDLG), which studies how blockchain technology can be used for clearing, settling, and recording securities trades. The group, which in 2018 began collaborating with the Global Blockchain Business Council, now includes around 40 financial institutions worldwide (though it claims far more in \"ambassador\" and other roles).\n\nBlockchain technology, a digital ledger that can be programmed to record financial transactions , is another area where CCPs have been adapted.\n\nBlockchain's inherent features are said to provide transactions with immutability, transparency, and near-real-time settlement.Having these would seem to eliminate the need for CCPs in some markets.Smart contracts,for instance, automatically execute trades and transfer assets without intermediaries.This has led some crypto enthusiasts to argue that blockchain could make CCPs obsolete.\n\nBut let's not get ahead of ourselves. While blockchain can streamline many processes, it can't perform all the risk management functions of CCPs. For example, CCPs handle collateral management, netting of positions, and default management procedures\u2014tasks still notional in blockchain-based systems.\n\nThere's also the problem that the financial industry has already been through a run of blockchain ventures that didn't pan out. As aFinancial Timesheadline put it in late 2023, the \"case for blockchain in financial services\" has been \"dented by failures.\"Here are a couple of examples:\n\nIn addition, while most DCOs have steered clear of unproven technologies, CCPs elsewhere in the world haven't been as patient.\n\nThe early 2020s failure of the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) blockchain project serves as a stark warning about the risks of adopting unproven technologies in critical financial infrastructure. It's worth looking at the debacle for that reason.Here's a brief timeline of events:\n\nThe Australian regulator said the case illustrates the dangers of overpromising on blockchain capabilities in complex financial systems. It also warned about the financial consequences and loss of trust that can come from pursuing trendy technologies without a thorough evaluation.\n\nASIC Chair Joe Longo said that ASX's claims over the years that its CHESS system was on track \"go to the heart of trust in the integrity of our markets.\" \"Companies and market participants rely on what the ASX says about its operations to make their own decisions and investments,\" he said.\n\nASIC, which has been busy bringing cases related to crypto fraud, pump-and-dump schemes, and scams involving major players in the Australian markets, has clearly tired of financial executives continually speaking of the promise of crypto and blockchain while hiding problems, if not outright scams.Between the summer of 2023 and 2024 alone, it brought suits in 615 cryptocurrency cons.\n\nIn the context of CCPs, novation is the process by which the CCP replaces the original parties to a trade by becoming the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer, thereby assuming the counterparty risk for both sides of the transaction.\n\nASX is not the only CCP looking to blockchain for greater efficiencies and the other promises of the technology.Euroclear, one of the largest in Europe, has been partnering with Paxos, a blockchain infrastructure company, to develop a blockchain-based platform for settling gold trades. The platform, Euroclear Bankchain, has completed pilot programs and has been processing settlements.\n\nIn addition, Euroclear has been working since 2021 on a central bank digital currency (CBDC) with the Banque de France while working out how to bring to the market blockchain-based settlements for government bonds.In March 2024, Euroclear also bought a major stake in IZNES, a regulated international platform for subscriptions and redemptions of shares of European funds.These efforts indicate that Euroclear is continuing to explore and develop blockchain-based clearing and settlement structures rather than abandoning them\u200b.\n\nSIX, the Swiss stock exchange operator, has the SIX Digital Exchange (SDX), which uses blockchain technology to offer trading, settlement, and custody services for digital assets.SDX leverages the blockchain for real-time settlement and the simultaneous transfer of ownership. This setup mirrors the role of a CCP by providing central clearing for digital asset trades on its platform. In 2024, SDX, the World Bank, and the Swiss National Bank issued the first Swiss Franc (CHF) digital bond by an international issuer, totaling CHF 200 million. This seven-year bond will settle using the SNB's wholesale CBDC, with coupon and redemption payments made intokenizedCHF on the SDX platform.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. clearing institutions like the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) that are working on blockchain-based systems are notable for their more circumspect approach. For example, DTCC has been using blockchain additional projects first, including its \"SmartNAV\" pilot project for publishing mutual fund asset information. In 2022, DTCC went live with its \"Project Ion,\" a blockchain-based alternative settlement platform. This platform usesdistributed ledger technology. Most importantly, though, it's designed to work alongside DTCC's existing systems, which remain authoritative for any cleared transactions.\n\nAs the integration of blockchain and traditional finance continues, it's likely we'll see hybrid models emerge. This could combine the efficiency and transparency of blockchain with the risk management expertise of CCPs. As the ASX debacle shows, while blockchain may offer potential benefits in particular, its application in core clearing and settlement functions is still just a promise on the horizon, not a proven technology.\n\nSome exchanges have long been asserting to develop their own CCP-like structures in the cryptocurrency space. For example, since 2018, Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges, has had what it says is a secured emergency fund for its users, which acts as a type of insurance fund to protect users in case of large-scale breaches or hacks\u2014a function that's said to be like the default funds maintained by traditional CCPs.\n\nHowever, that's hardly the case: estimates put the amount traded each year on Binance at $1.5 trillion; the company said in August 2024 that assets in its CCP-like fund were valued at $1 billion, the same as in 2022.For comparison, LCH, which clears about the same value each year, has about six times as much in its backup funds, which aligns with regulatory and International Swaps and Derivatives Association and other international clearing best practices.\n\nMoreover, many of the claims in the crypto space to have robust protections aren't true at all. For example, FTX, the major cryptocurrency exchange founded by the since-convicted Sam Bankman-Fried, rapidly grew into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise, not least on the back of its claim to insure at least part of its users' deposits. Afterit collapsed in November 2022due to fraud, misuse of customer funds, and a liquidity crisis, its bankruptcy exposed significant gaps in oversight and governance within the crypto industry, leading to widespread investor losses and a slew of criminal proceedings.\n\nA significant element in the FTX meltdown was its claim to have a fund that functioned similarly to a CCP, designed to protect against systemic risk within the platform. This fund, labeled on the exchange as the \"FTX Insurance Fund,\" was said to be able to cover losses in cases where large-scale liquidations occurred that couldn't be fully absorbed by the market. The idea was to create a buffer to prevent cascading failures within the platform, similar to how a CCP acts as a backstop in traditional financial markets.\n\nHowever, FTX\u2019s approach to providing such protections was, in the end, criminal. In 2023, FTX's cofounder, Gary Wang, testified that the amount displayed to investors as in the fund was taken from a random number multiplied by thedaily volumeon the exchange. Not even a fraction of that number was ever stored away.The difference between a CCP operating under strict regulatory oversight and crypto exchanges' claims to mirror such investor protections is stark and profound:\n\nEnables market stability and confidence\n\nAllows more efficient and secure trading\n\nOperational and compliance burden on market participants\n\nCentral Counterparties (CCPs) offer significant benefits in trading by mitigating counterparty risk. They act as intermediaries, ensuring that both parties meet their obligations and reducing the risk ofdefault. This structure enhances market stability and confidence, making trading more efficient and secure.\n\nHowever, CCPs also present certain risks and limitations. One of the main concerns is the concentration of risk. Since CCPs centralize counterparty risk management, any failure or disruption in a CCP could have widespread impacts on the entire financial system, potentially leading to systemic risk.\n\nAnother limitation of CCPs is their operational andcomplianceburden on market participants. Companies must follow stringent regulations and uphold robust risk management protocols, which can demand considerable resources. These requirements can also limit market access for smaller participants, potentially reducing market liquidity and diversity. That said, it's unlikely these markets would have a fraction of their participants without the trust built by these regulations and risk management standards.The rise and fall of various crypto ventures shows the value of such robust requirements.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service rates CCPs worldwide. In its periodic reports, Moody\u2019s evaluates how a CCP is meeting its clearing and settlement obligations and how much money will likely be lost if a trader defaults on an obligation.The CCR report factors in the following considerations:\n\nThe Options Clearing Corporation in the U.S. is a CCP that clears and settles all options traded on U.S. options exchanges.\n\nCCPs improve market stability by mitigating counterparty risk, ensuring that trades are completed even if one party defaults.\n\nCCPs manage the risk of default by employing risk management techniques, includingmargin requirementsand regular stress testing.\n\nYes, most CCPs operate across many asset classes, including equities, derivatives, and fixed-income securities.\n\nCCPs act as intermediaries in the clearing and settlement of trades, particularly in derivatives markets. Unlike traditional clearing houses, which focus on settling trades between the original parties, CCPs have the additional role of becoming the counterparty to both sides of a trade through a process known as novation. To manage risks, CCPs maintain emergency or default funds, which are designed to cover extreme scenarios such as the default of several major clearing members simultaneously.\n\nThese funds come from member contributions, scaled according to the risk they bring to the CCP. While CCPs and traditional clearing houses share the goal of reducing settlement risk, CCPs have a more active and risk-intensive role because they assume counterparty risk. In the U.S., many CCPs are registered as DCOs with the CFTC, meaning they must meet stringent regulatory standards specific to derivatives markets.\n\nCommodities Futures Trading Commission. \"Derivatives Clearing Organizations.\"\n\nEuropean Association of CCP Clearing Houses. \"Central Counterparty Clearing Houses and Financial Stability.\"\n\nJohn C.
