  "term": "What Is Industrial Production Index (IPI)? How It Measures Output",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe industrial production index (IPI) is a monthlyeconomic indicatormeasuring real output\u00a0in the manufacturing, mining, electric, and gas industries, relative to abase year.\n\nIt is published in the middle of every month by theFederal Reserve Board(FRB) and reported on by theConference Board,\u00a0a member-driven\u00a0economic think tank. The FRB also releases revisions to previous estimates at the end of every March.\n\nThe industrial production index (IPI)\u00a0measures levels of production in the manufacturing, mining\u2014including oil and gas field drilling services\u2014and electrical and gas utilities sectors. It also measurescapacity, an estimate of the production levels that could be sustainably maintained; andcapacity utilization, the ratio of actual output to capacity.\n\nIndustrial production and capacity levels are expressed as anindexlevel relative to a base year\u2014currently 2012. In other words, they do not express absolute production volumes or values, but the percentage change in production relative to 2012.\n\nThe source data is varied, including physical inputs and outputs such as tons of steel;inflation-adjusted sales figures; and, in some cases, hours logged by production workers. The FRB\u00a0obtains this data from industry associations and government agencies and aggregates them into an index using the Fisher-ideal formula.\n\nThe indices are available inseasonally adjustedand unadjusted formats.\n\nWithin the overall IPI,\u00a0there are a number ofsub-indicesproviding a detailed look at the output of highly specific industries. Examples of a few of the dozens of industries for which monthly production data is available include: residential gas sales, ice cream and frozen dessert, carpet and rug mills, spring and wire products, pig iron, audio and video equipment, and paper.\n\nIndustry-level data are useful for managers and investors within specific lines of business, while the composite index is an important macroeconomic indicator foreconomistsand investors\u2014fluctuations within the industrial sector account for most of the variation in overalleconomic growth.\n\nAt the same time, IPI\u00a0differs from the most popular measure of economic output,gross domestic product(GDP): GDP measures the price paid by the end-user, so it includes value-added in the retail sector, which IPI\u00a0ignores. It is also important to note that theindustrial sectormakes up a low and falling share of the U.S. economy\u2014less than 20% of GDP as of 2016.\n\nCapacity utilization is a useful indicator of the strength of demand. Low capacity utilization, orovercapacity, signals weak demand. Policymakers could read this as a signal thatfiscal or monetarystimulus is needed. Investors, meanwhile, could interpret it as a sign of a coming downturn, or\u2014depending on the signals from Washington\u2014as a sign of coming stimulus.\n\nHigh capacity utilization, on the other hand, can act as a warning that the economy is overheating, suggesting the risk ofprice risesand asset bubbles. Policymakers could react to those threats with interest rate rises or fiscal austerity. Alternatively, they could let thebusiness cycletake its course, likely resulting in an eventual recession.\n\nBelow is the seasonally-adjusted IPI for the 50 years to October 2017. Data is available going back to January 1919.",
