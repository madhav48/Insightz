  "definition": "Terms of employment detail the responsibilities and benefits associated with a job, as agreed upon by an employer and employee at the time of hiring. They define the work relationship and are sometimes known as an employment contract.\n\nThese terms, which may also be referred to as conditions of employment, generally detail job responsibilities, work hours, dress code, time off the job, and starting salary. They may also include information about benefits such as health insurance, life insurance, and retirement plans.\n\nAlthough terms of employment may be agreed upon verbally, employees and employers normally sign written contracts, which makes their agreement legally official.\n\nIf you are an at-will employee, your employer can change the terms of employment, including your salary, hours, and worksite, at any time.\n\nMost employers require professional and administrative employees, as well asexecutives, to sign a written employment agreement or contract that details the terms of employment.\n\nThe conditions of employment for hourly employees are often outlined in an employee handbook or company policy manual. In certain circumstances, terms may also be expressed verbally. Written terms, though, can protect both the employee and the employer.\n\nIn addition to the nuts and bolts of salary and benefits, terms of employment can deal with important issues such as dispute resolution, nondisclosure agreements, and grounds for termination, as well as the possibility of anotice of termination.\n\nJob seekers with skills in high demand are often able tonegotiatebetter terms of employment. Negotiations involving executive-level applicants will include terms relating to hiring managers and candidates.\n\nWhether it's an executive position or anentry-level job, terms of employment are subject to state and federal guidelines.\n\nIn fact, minimum standards forterms of employmentin the U.S. are set by theDepartment of Labor (DOL). These standards cover theminimum wage, overtime, the standard work week, mandated break times, and safety issues.\n\nThe DOL also governs employment laws in certain industries, such as agriculture, mining, and construction.\n\nState laws may add additional benefits, rules, or rights regarding employment within state jurisdictions.\n\nMake sure that you read the entire employment contract offered by a prospective employer before you sign it. If you're unsure of any terms, it's a good idea to have an attorney take a look at it.\n\nEmployment contracts are normally considered at-will in the U.S. This means that either the employer or employee can legally terminate the agreement at any time for almost any reason.\n\nIn other words, at-will employment allows an employeeto be firedeven if no terms of employment have been violated. In practice, however, employees with signed employment contracts generally have a degree of job security for the length of the contract as long as they do not violate any contract conditions.\n\nMontana is the only state in which at-will laws don't apply. So employees can only be terminated for good reason.\n\nThe at-will rule also doesn't apply to individuals who are part oflabor unions. These organizations help protect workers' rights by negotiating benefits and other employment conditions, includingterms of termination.\n\nEmployees who are members of unions have set contracts and can't be terminated at-will, thanks tocollective bargainingagreements.\n\nEmployment lawsprotect workers from discrimination due to race, gender, or religion.\n\nMost developed and developing countries have codified certain standard terms of employment.\n\nIreland passed a Terms of Employment (Information) Act which outlines rules covering a variety of workplace and labor topics.\n\nAustralia's Fair Work Ombudsman sets rules related to pay, leave, redundancy, entitlements, and more.\n\nU.S. labor laws are less generous than those in other parts of the world. The European Union, for example, mandates that workers get at least four weeks of vacation every year.\n\nIn Finland, expectant mothers get paid leave at least six weeks before their due date, and 15 more weeks after the birth\u00a0of a child.\n\nBenefitslike these may not be included in your next terms of employment, no matter how hard you bargain.\n\nThey're important because they define how you must work and the benefits you can receive when you are hired by a company. It's essential that you review them carefully before signing or starting work because you'll be making a commitment to accept and abide by them.\n\nYes, they can change. However, you have to agree to any changes made by your employer. Otherwise, such an action may be considered a breach of contract.\n\nThey can try to do so. A good time to improve terms is during the negotiation stage prior to becoming officially employed. Neither you nor your potential employer has signed any contract at that point, so terms are open to discussion. You can propose changes after you become an employee, but both you and your employer must agree to them in order for them to become valid.\n\nTerms of employment are the terms that define the employer\u2014employee work relationship and are the the conditions under which an employee must work. Depending on how valued an employee is, certain terms of employment may be subject to negotiation.\n\nTerms of employment, which can also be referred to as conditions of employment or an employment contract, must meet minimum standards set by the federal and state governments.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Wages and the Fair Labor Standards Act.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Employment Law Guide: Laws, Regulations, and Technical Assistance Services.\"\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures. \"Labor and Employment.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"State Labor Laws.\"\n\nNational Conference of State Legislatures. \"At-Will Employment - Overview.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor, Worker Organizing Resource and Knowledge Center. \"What Is a Union.\"\n\nGovernment of Ireland. \"Terms of Employment (Information) Act, 1994.\"\n\nAustralian Government. \"Workplace Laws.\"\n\nAustralian Government. \"Fair Work Ombudsman.\"\n\nThe European Union. \"Leave and Flexible Working.\"\n\nThe European Union. \"Employment, Social Affairs, and Inclusion: Finland - Maternity and Paternity.\"",
