She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA hot wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that is always connected to the internet or another connected device. Hot wallets are used as temporary key storage and to send and receive cryptocurrency. Usually, their interfaces also allow you to view how many tokens you have available.\n\nWhen you buy or mine a cryptocurrency, you must set up a wallet to facilitate transactions if you decide to use it to purchase goods or services. Yourcryptocurrencies, or rather the private keys you use to access the currency, are stored in these wallets when you receive a coin.\n\nWhen you own a cryptocurrency, you're givenprivate keysto access it. Public keys are similar to account usernames; they identify the wallet so that the user can receive tokens without revealing their identity. Private keys are similar to personal identification numbers that must be entered when creating a transaction. The wallets that store these keys are usually accessed with usernames and passwords but can also use different login techniques.\n\nHot wallets are applications connected to the internet and the cryptocurrency infrastructure, which allows you to use them. For a user, the hot wallet is the interface for using and storing your cryptocurrency keys.\n\nThey are different fromcold wallets, which are devices or applications that store your private keys offline\u2014these can be an application on a device that doesn't connect to the internet or a device that looks like a USB thumb drive that stores your keys. You can even write your keys on a piece of paper, which is considered a cold wallet. To use the cryptocurrency you have in cold storage, you need to transfer the keys to your hot wallet.\n\nCold wallets, also called cold storage, are considered one of the safest methods for securing digital currency.\n\nThere are various hot wallets available, and many of them are free to download. Some wallets are specifically designed to be used in partnership with particular mobile web applications; you might find one that only works with a particular cryptocurrency or ecosystem. In addition, some cryptocurrency exchanges will only accept transfers to and from specific wallets.\n\nExamples of hot wallets are MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, and Edge Wallet. MetaMask is designed for transactions using the Ethereum ecosystem. Coinbase Wallet is the wallet for the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, and Edge Wallet is designed to accept transactions using all of your digital assets.\n\nBecause there are so many wallets with different designs and intents, it's important for you to research hot wallets before downloading and using their services. Wallet developers have varying degrees of expertise, various commitments to security and privacy, and different priorities in mind when creating their wallets. Some might have fees; others might not. You might need to use one wallet that integrates with your internet browser for one currency and another wallet that is a dedicated application.\n\nOn the internet, you might find cryptocurrency cold and hot wallets broken down into many categories like hardware, software, web, desktop, or mobile. All the different categories and definitions exist because many businesses are trying to get you to spend money, and writers, academics, and enthusiasts are trying to standardize cryptocurrency and blockchain definitions or demonstrate their expertise. What's important to remember when you're reading about wallets is that it doesn't matter what it is called:\n\nThere are several aspects you should consider before deciding on your hot wallet. Most important are its security features and how you use them. Your cryptocurrency is only as safe as the way you store your keys. Any items stored in a hot wallet are vulnerable to hacks, malware, ransomware, or any other method thieves can think of.\n\nTo keep your cryptocurrency safe, consider some of these tips.\n\nThe old saying, \"Don't keep all of your eggs in one basket,\" applies to many financial assets, including cryptocurrency. If you use more than one storage type or strategy, you're minimizing the risks of theft and loss.\n\nIt's a good idea to keep only a small portion of your crypto-assets in your hot wallet; you might consider only putting the amount of cryptocurrency you need in it when you need it. This strategy would mean storing most of your assets in a cold wallet and transferring what you need to the hot wallet for immediate or near-future use.\n\nYou could also choose to keep your cryptocurrency tokens in accounts linked to the exchange you use. Someexchangeswill store your cryptocurrency for you in cold storage. These exchanges either subcontract custodial services and transfer your keys to them or have built data storage methods designed for key storage.\n\nHowever, if you keep your tokens in an exchange account and an attacker\u00a0gains access to the exchange's network, you could lose your cryptocurrency in the attack. To help customers if this happens, some exchanges are insured for the loss of customers' assets if they (the exchange) lose them due to theft or failure of their systems and will reimburse you up to a certain amount.\n\nIf you maintain a substantial balance of cryptocurrency, you're accepting the risk of drawing the attention of hackers or losing a significant portion of your holdings in an attack. Because many of the top digital currency exchanges allow users to transfer between various fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies, you should only hold small amounts in your wallet. You can convert the rest to your country's currency and place it in your bank account.\n\nThere might be fees for exchanging cryptocurrency for fiat currency and transferring the funds out of the exchange or removing it to store it, but it's worth considering if you're not holding your cryptocurrency as an investment.\n\nCryptocurrency investingis similar to stock market investing\u2014you own a cryptocurrency and wait for its fair market value to increase. You could continue holding it or try to sell it to another investor at a profit. However, a hot wallet is a precarious place to store your cryptocurrency investments. Cold storage, such as apaper walletor other non-connected methods, might serve you better as you wait for your cryptocurrency's value to increase.\n\nYou could also use a custodial cold wallet, such as a reputable, regulated, and insured exchange's cold storage orlicensed digital asset custodian. Another option is to invest in a cryptocurrency ETF that holds cryptocurrency so that you gain exposure to these assets without needing to secure them yourself.\n\nOnly keep small amounts in your hot wallet, ensure you back it up, keep the software up to date, encrypt it, and keep your password secure to make sure your wallet is safe.\n\nA hot wallet is any software or device designed to hold cryptocurrency private keys with a connection to another device or the internet.\n\nCoinbase provides a hot wallet for its customers that allows them to interact with the exchange's services.\n\nMany hot wallets are free because they are downloadable software or apps. There are some devices with software uploaded on them that can act as hot and cold wallets. Depending on the options, these can range from less than $100 to hundreds of dollars.\n\nHot wallets are any private key storage method that has a connection to another device or the internet. All hot wallets have or are software of some type, so they are vulnerable to hacking, malware, viruses, ransomware, or other methods used by criminals.\n\nThere are many hot wallets available, so it is best to research for the one you prefer and only keep the keys to the crypto you intend to spend in it. Once you use your crypto in your hot wallet, transfer the keys backto cold storage to be safe.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
