The printing of paper money is typically regulated by a country's central bank or treasury in order to keep the flow of funds in line withmonetary policy.\n\nPaper money tends to be updated with new versions that contain security features and attempt to make it more difficult for counterfeiters to create illegal copies.\n\nThe first recorded use of paper money was purported to be in the country of China during the 7th century A.D. as a means of reducing the need to carry heavy and cumbersome strings of metallic coins to conduct transactions. Similar to making a deposit at a modern bank, individuals would transfer their coins to a trustworthy party and then receive a note denoting how much money they had deposited. The note could then be redeemed for currency at a later date.\n\nIn the U.S., paper money is consideredfiat money. This means that it has no actual value except as an accepted medium of exchange.

The U.S. dollar is so widely used that 60% of globally disclosed officialforeign reserveswere in U.S. dollars as of 2021. This compares to 21% for the euro, 6% for the Japanese yen, 5% for the British pound, and 2% for the Chinese renminbi.\n\nThe euro is another form of paper money that is used in multiple countries. As of 2023, 20 of the 27 member states in the European Union (EU) use the euro as their official currency.\n\nWhile paper money is the most accepted medium of exchange, companies often issue shares of their own company to purchase other companies and reward their staff. Shares are units of ownership in a company that entitle the shareholder to an equal distribution of any profits. Of all accepted mediums of exchange, shares are closest to paper money because they can be exchanged on the open market for cash.\n\nYes, paper money is fiat money. Fiat money is any money that is considered legal tender. Paper money and coins are legal tender.\n\nCryptocurrencies are not fiat money.
