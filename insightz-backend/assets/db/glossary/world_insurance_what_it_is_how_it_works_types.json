  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nWorld insurance is a type of commercial liability policy with extended global coverage. World insurance provides coverage in the event the policyholder is sued anywhere in the world. In general, however, commercial liability policies have a geographic limit for coverage.\n\nMultinational firms, corporations with a global footprint, or domestic companies that have contracts with international partners/associates often obtain this type of insurance.\n\nWorld insurance requires the policyholder to pay an additional premium.\u00a0In addition to property and workers' compensation insurance, commercial liability insurance (also referred to as general liability insurance) is essential to businesses.\n\nThis insurance protects the assets of a business in the event it is sued for alleged bodily injury or property damages. The insurer may also cover damages and legal expenses associated with covered claims involving actual or alleged product liability, contractual liability, personal injury, advertising injury, and other commercial risks as indicated in the policy.\n\nIt's important for organizations to understand the scope of their insurance needs\u00a0for their international business operations. It's\u00a0critical to protect\u00a0corporate assets, and most\u00a0insurance policies placed in the U.S. provide limited, if any, coverage for losses occurring abroad. There are numerous specialized world insurance policies\u00a0available to\u00a0companies for conducting international business that are designed to provide\u00a0global protection.\n\nDepending on the extent of the foreign business being conducted, there are several types of insurance to consider. Many of these and other\u00a0foreign liability coverages can be packaged and purchased together and added to\u00a0as\u00a0business needs change.\n\nThis type of coverage is similar to domestic liability coverage, but it's for foreign occurrences and includes protection for U.S. occurrences when a suit is brought outside the U.S. or Canada. This type of coverage becomes necessary if\u00a0manufacturers and distributors that sell products outside of the U.S. are\u00a0sued in foreign jurisdictions. A U.S.-based policy would only cover lawsuits that are filed in the U.S. or Canada.\n\nCompanies buy this to protect against\u00a0physical damage and liability for hired and non-owned vehicles operated overseas. Coverage is typically needed for limits over and above the minimum or statutory limits that are required to be purchased from the rental company in the foreign country.\n\nThe purpose of this coverage is to extend benefits for U.S. employees while traveling overseas or when assigned to work outside the U.S. and Canada. Coverage can include medical assistance programs and repatriation expenses.\n\nThis type of insurance affords protection at unscheduled locations while in transit for laptop computers, sales samples, and personal property at trade shows overseas. A more extensive policy may be required for owned or leased facilities.\n\nA kind of coverage that protects\u00a0against losses\u00a0from dishonest acts perpetrated by employees overseas, including forgery, theft, or robbery.\n\nWhen companies, or individuals, buy this type of insurance, they are looking for additional protection in the event of an emergency while traveling overseas.\n\nThe Hartford Insurance. \"Global Insurance \u2013 Multinational Business Coverage.\"",
