  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA validation code\u2014also known as a CVV, CV2, or CVV2 code\u2014is a series of three or four numbers located on the front or back of acredit card. It is intended to provide an additional layer of security for credit card transactions that take place online or over the phone.\n\nMost credit card issuers place their validation codes on the back of the card, on the far-right side of the signature panel. On American Express (AXP) cards, however, the validation code is printed on the front of the card.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAs online shopping continues to grow in popularity, the threat ofidentity theftand other forms of credit card fraud has become increasingly severe. One measure taken to try to mitigate this risk is the use of validation codes when making credit card purchases.\n\nIn a typical transaction, a customer will be asked to provide their name, billing address, card number, expiration date, and validation code. Although many of these details, such as the name and address, could be obtained from other sources, the card number, expiration date, and validation code can theoretically only be obtained from possessing the card itself. As an added measure, the validation code is generally printed on the back of the card, making it more difficult for would-be thieves to glean all the necessary information from a single photograph of the credit card.\n\nTo process the credit card transaction andverify the identity of the user, the entered CVV is compared against the card number.\n\nTo further enhance these security measures, consumer protection laws prevent merchants from storing customers\u2019 validation codes after a purchase has been made\u2014although unscrupulous sellers may still record this information illegally. An additional measure of protection is provided by the personal identification numbers (PINs) that cardholders must enter when making payments usingpoint-of-sale (POS)terminals.\n\nAlthough security measures such as the validation code raise the difficulty of committing identity theft or making purchases using a stolen credit card, they are unlikely to deter a sufficiently motivated thief. In practice, credit card fraud has continued to climb in recent years, surpassing 393,207 reported cases in 2020.The United States is by far the most acutely affected country, representing nearly 34% of global cases.\n\nMerchants are not allowed to store card security codes after a customer makes a purchase, which provides extra protection against credit card theft. Still, validation codes can be stolen, and cardholders should protect their card\u2019s validation code just as they would protect the card number and expiration date. The validation code is a key piece of data that can enable thieves to make fraudulent transactions with someone else\u2019s card.\n\nHowever, if a thief does use a stolen card, the cardholder's liability is limited to $50 under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA), depending on when the theft is reported. Customers who realize their card is missing, or detect suspicious or unauthorized purchases or other activity, should contact their credit card issuer immediately to report the problem and alert them to a possible case of fraud. The card issuer can then cancel or deactivate the card.\n\nAmerican Express. \"Many Kinds of Cards.
