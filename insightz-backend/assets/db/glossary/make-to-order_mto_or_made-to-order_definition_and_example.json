  "term": "Make-to-Order (MTO) or Made-to-Order: Definition and Example",
  "definition": "Make-to-order refers to a manufacturing approach where items are produced exclusively in response to confirmed customer orders.\n\nIn make-to-order manufacturing, no inventory is built in advance. Products are only made after they\u2019ve been ordered. MTO is part of the pull-through production process, which occurs when companies produce goods based on actual consumerdemand. It is common in certain industries, such as the aircraft and automotive industries.\n\nAs noted above, make-to-order is a business strategy used by manufacturers to meet consumer demand. It means that acompanyonly manufactures the end product once the customer places the order. While this creates additional wait time for the consumer to receive the product, it does allow for more flexible customization when compared to purchasing directly from retailers' shelves.\n\nThis strategy is apull-through productionor pull-typesupply chainoperation because products are only made when strong customer demand exists. This production model is commonly in the assembly industry where the quantity needed to be produced per product specification is one or only a few. This includes specialized industries, such as aircraft and vessel production, automotive, and construction among others. MTO is also appropriate for highly configured products such as computer servers, automobiles, bicycles, or products that are very expensive to keepinventory.\n\nHere's how the MTO process works:\n\nSome companies adopt the MTO production system to manage inventory levels and provide their customers with increased customization. The MTO strategy relieves the problems of excess inventory that are common with other types of production strategies.Dellis an example of a business that uses the MTO production strategy, wherein customers can order a fully customized computer online and receive it in a couple of weeks.\n\nMake-to-order is also known as made-to-order ormass customization.\n\nThe main advantage of the MTO system is the ability to fulfill an order with the exact product specification required by the customer. If the company can deliver the product just as the customer wants, they are more likely to remain loyal to the brand.\n\nSales discounts and finished goods inventory are also reduced, and stock obsolescence is managed. As such, it ensures that companies can get full price for their goods. It also reduces waste and helps promoteefficiency.\n\nOne of the main drawbacks of make-to-order management is the timeliness of the customization process. If products are already on the shelf (as with MTS), then a customer doesn't have to wait until the product is made, assembled, and delivered to spec.\n\nCost is also a factor. Pre-made and available products are all alike and so manufacturing costs are lowered due toeconomies of scale. MTO, on the other hand, tends to be more expensive for the consumer since it involves customizable parts and finishes.\n\nMeets specific needs of customers\n\nReduces waste and promotes efficiency\n\nTraditional strategies produce products and stock them as inventory until a customer buys them. This is known asmake-to-stock (MTS). Unlike MTO, which is meant to reduce waste and be more efficient, MTS may be prone to wastage and obsolescence as inventory sits on shelves waiting to be purchased. This problem is particularly acute in an industry like technology, where advancement is quick and the problem of obsolete inventory could quickly arise.\n\nThe MTS method is a theoretically great way for companies to prepare for increases and decreases in demand. However, inventory numbers and production are derived by creating future\u00a0demandforecastsbased on past data.\n\nBut, there is a high likelihood that the forecasts will be off\u2014even if just slightly. This means that a company may be stuck with too much inventory and too littleliquidity. This is the main drawback of the MTS method of production. Inaccurate forecasts will lead to losses, stemming from excess inventory or stockouts. Excess inventory can quickly become obsolete in fast-paced sectors like electronics or computer tech.\n\nMTO is similar toassemble-to-order (ATO). ATO is a business production strategy where products ordered by customers are customizable to a certain extent and produced quickly.\n\nThe ATO strategy requires that the basic parts of the product are not assembled. Instead, they are already manufactured and ready for use. Once an order is received, the parts are assembled quickly and sent to the customer. Costs vary in the ATO strategy where assembly costs are negligible while the cost of the components can be substantial.\n\nThis manufacturing process is common in theelectronics industry, which involves computer production. Consumers and computer companies may design specific devices using customized components like monitors and keyboards.\n\nFor an MTO system to succeed, it should be coupled with proactive demand management. Companies should also understand that the MTO system is not appropriate for all types of products, such as goods for everyday use.\n\nThe MTO strategy is not suitable for every product or industry. Everyday goods and services, which are meant for mass consumption, are not manufactured in an MTO process. Because of the intricacies and costs involved, MTO tends to be used in certain specialized industries, including:\n\nMTO is very common in property development. Manyreal estatedevelopers buy large plots of land and sell them to consumers. Builders allow home buyers to make customizations in the design and construction of their homes. This includes floor plans, architectural designs, and the use of fixtures. For instance, companies like Pulte Homes offer customized homes in many states across the U.S.\n\nA good example is the production of custom electric bicycles. When a customer orders a bike, they choose from a range of options\u2014such as a step-through or mountain frame, a 500W or 750W motor, battery size (e.g., 48V 14Ah or 52V 20Ah), frame color, and add-ons like a rear cargo rack, hydraulic brakes, or integrated turn signals. No physical product exists until this configuration is submitted andpaymentis received, triggering the manufacturing process.\n\nOnce the order is confirmed, the production team reviews the specifications and begins sourcing the necessary components. If the customer selected a 750W motor with a long-range 52V battery and matte black frame, those parts are either pulled from on-hand stock or ordered from suppliers. When all components are ready, assembly begins in a step-by-step process. The frame is prepped and painted, the motor is mounted to the rear hub, the battery housing is installed on the downtube, and electrical wiring is routed through the frame. The bike is then fitted with the selected features, such as an LCD display, throttle control, and accessories.\n\nAfter assembly, the custom e-bike is tested for electrical performance, battery charging, motor responsiveness, and braking. Note that this testing has happened after the order as been incurred as opposed to testing happening before the order (which would then allow the bike to be distributed to aretailcompany, for example). Once it passes all quality control tests, the bike is packed securely and shipped directly to the customer. Another key takeaway here is that the product usually doesn't rest at an intermediary location; it goes directly to the customer as opposed to sitting on a shelf.\n\nA make-to-order strategy is a business strategy that companies use to customize products according to customer demand to meet their needs. To put this strategy in place, companies must\n\nMake-to-order business strategies allow customers to order products from companies that are manufactured to their needs. This strategy is common in various industries, including aircraft, automotive, construction, computer hardware, and furniture. For instance, an automotive manufacturer may allow consumers to customize the design of their vehicles.\n\nCompanies can generate interest and brand loyalty by offering consumers make-to-order products. This means they can meet the needs of customers who are willing to pay more money for a product they want. It also helps reduce waste and promotes efficiency by using only those materials that are needed in the production process.But there are drawbacks. The most notable being the time it takes to produce customized goods and the high cost involved in the production process.\n\nMost of the goods and services we use each day are meant for mass consumption. But, if you have the money, you can procure products that are manufactured in the make-to-order process. This involves customizing goods according to a consumer's needs. Things like airplanes, homes, high-end fashion, cars, and computers may be made to the unique specifications of consumers. While it can help companies make more money and reduce waste, it often costs more. And consumers must wait longer to have their orders fulfilled.\n\nPulte Homes. \"Personalize Your Home.\"",
