Buffett is the chair and CEO ofBerkshire Hathaway, a company that he became the controlling shareholder of in the mid-1960s.\n\nHe is called the Oracle of Omaha\u00a0because the investment community very closely follows his investment picks and comments on the market, and he lives and works in Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nWarren Buffett is one of the richest men in the world. He built his fortune using a simple yet powerfulinvestment strategy. His investments are long-term positions, accomplished by the purchase of fundamentally sound companies that are trading well below theirintrinsic value. Some of his most publicized investments include Coca-Cola, Gillette, and Dairy Queen. As of May 2025, the Oracle of Omaha is estimated to have a net worth of over $156 billion.\n\nIn 2006, Warren Buffett pledged to give away over 99% of his fortune.\n\nWarren Buffett was born in Omaha, Nebraska, in 1930 to Howard and Leila Buffett. The Oracle of Omaha\u2019s father was astockbroker, which gave him an early introduction to the stock market. Buffett purchased his first stock at age 11; he bought threesharesof Cities Service Preferred for $38 per share and sold them at $40 per share. After he sold the stock, it advanced to $200. On reflection, Buffett believes this taught him the virtue of patience.\n\nBuffett demonstrated business prowess from his early teens, running a paper delivery business and completing his own tax returns.\u00a0The Oracle of Omaha\u00a0started a pinball machine business while in high school and went on to sell the business for $1,300. He graduated from the University of Nebraska with a business degree.\n\nOn May 1, 2021, the vice chair of Berkshire Hathaway, Charlie Munger, unofficially announced that Warren Buffett would besucceeded as CEOby Greg Abel when the 91-year-old Buffett eventually steps down.

Buffett attempts to do this by buying companies that are out of favor with the market. He values a company by assessing its fundamentals, such asreturn on equityand profitability.\n\nFor example, Buffett likes a company to have a low debt/equity ratio. He wants earnings growth generated fromshareholders' equityas opposed to debt.

Buffett was drawn to Coca-Cola\u2019s powerful global brand, its \u201ceconomic moat,\u201d and its consistent ability to generate stable cash flows.\n\nAs of 2025, the original $1.3 billion investment is worth nearly $25 billion.Keep in mind that in 2025, Berkshire Hathaway is set to receive $816 million in dividends from its 400 million Coca-Cola shares, which pay $2.04 per share annually.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s investment in Apple marked a notable shift in his traditional approach, as he had long been hesitant to invest in technology companies. Berkshire Hathaway began buying Apple stock in 2016.However, Buffett quickly took a personal interest in the company and dramatically increased the stake, viewing Apple not as a typical tech stock but as a consumer product company with strong brand loyalty and recurring revenue. It's estimated that as of May 2025, Berkshire Hathaway holds 300 million shares of Apple.\n\nWarren Buffett is an American investor, business tycoon, and philanthropist, best known as the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway.
