  "term": "Foreign Currency Convertible Bond (FCCB) Defined, How It Works",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) is a type of convertible bond issued in a currency different than the issuer's domestic currency. In other words, the money being raised by the issuing company is in the form of foreign currency. A convertible bond is a mix between a debt and equity instrument. It acts like a bond by making regular coupon and principal payments, but these bonds also give the bondholder the option to convert the bond into stock.\n\nA bond is a debt instrument that provides income to investors in the form of regularly scheduled interest payments calledcoupons. At thematurity dateof the bond, the investors are repaid the fullface valueof the bond. Some corporate entities issue a type of bond known as convertible bonds.\n\nA bondholder with aconvertible bondhas the option of converting the bond into a specified number of shares of the issuing company. Convertible bonds have aconversion rateat which the bonds will be converted to equity. However, if the stock price stays below the conversion price, the bond will not be converted. Thus, convertible bonds allow bondholders to participate in the appreciation of the issuer\u2019s underlying shares. There are various types of convertible bonds, one of which is the foreign currency convertible bond.\n\nA company may choose to issue FCCBs in the currency of a country with lower interest rates or a more stable economy than the issuer's home country.\n\nA foreign currency convertible bond (FCCB) is a convertible bond that is issued in a foreign currency, which means the principal repayment and periodic coupon payments will be made in a foreign currency. For example, an American listed company that issues a bond in India in rupees has, in effect, issued an FCCB.\n\nForeign currency convertible bonds are typically issued by multinational companies operating in a global space and looking to raise capital in foreign currencies. FCCB investors are usually hedge fund arbitrators and foreign nationals. These bonds can be issued along with acall option(whereby the right of redemption lies with the bond issuer) orput options(whereby the right of redemption lies with bondholder).\n\nA company may decide to raise money outside its home country to gain access to new markets for new or expansionary projects. FCCBs are generally issued by companies in the currency of those countries where interest rates are usually lower than the home country or foreign country economy is more stable than the home country economy. Due to the equity side of the bond, which adds value, the coupon payments on the bond are lower for the issuer than a straight coupon-bearing plain vanilla bond, thereby, reducing its debt-financing costs. In addition, a favorable move in the exchange rates can reduce the issuer\u2019scost of debt, which is the interest payment made on bonds.\n\nSince the principal has to be repaid at maturity, an adverse movement in exchange rates in which the local currency weakens can cause cash outflows on repayment to be higher than any savings in interest rates, resulting in losses for the issuer. In addition, issuing bonds in a foreign currency exposes the issuer to any political, economic, and legal risks prevalent in the country. Furthermore, if the issuer\u2019s stock price declines below the conversion price, FCCB investors will not convert their bonds to equity, which means the issuer will have to make the principal repayments at maturity.\n\nAn FCCB investor can purchase these bonds at a stock exchange, and has the option to convert the bond into equity or adepositary receiptafter a certain period of time. Investors can participate in any price appreciation of the issuer\u2019s stock by converting the bond to equity. Bondholders take advantage of this appreciation by means ofwarrantsattached to the bonds, which are activated when the price of the stock reaches a certain point.",
