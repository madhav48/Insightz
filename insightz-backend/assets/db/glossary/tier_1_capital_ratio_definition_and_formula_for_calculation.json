  "term": "Tier 1 Capital Ratio: Definition and Formula for Calculation",
  "definition": "The tier 1 capital ratio indicates a bank's financial strength, calculated as the ratio of a bank's core tier 1 capital to its total risk-weighted assets.\n\nThe tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank's tier 1 or core capital. Financial institutions must meet a certain ratio to ensure their financial stability. Tier 1 capital is the minimum amount that a bank must hold in its reserves to finance its banking activities. This ratio measures a bank's core equity capital in relation to its total risk-weighted assets. Tier 1 capital is composed of a bank's common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, and any regulatory adjustments to those accounts.\n\nTier\u00a01\u00a0Capital\u00a0Ratio=Tier\u00a01\u00a0CapitalTotal\u00a0Risk\u00a0Weighted\u00a0Assets\\text{Tier 1 Capital Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Tier 1 Capital}}{\\text{Total Risk Weighted Assets}}Tier\u00a01\u00a0Capital\u00a0Ratio=Total\u00a0Risk\u00a0Weighted\u00a0AssetsTier\u00a01\u00a0Capital\u200b\n\nBanks are required to hold a certain level of capital or assets in theirreserves. These are divided into tiers, such as tier 1 and tier 2. Tier 1 capital is a bank's core capital, which it uses to run its day-to-day operations. This category includes assets such as retained earnings, common stock, and certain kinds of preferred stock. It does not include money deposited by customers.\n\nAs noted above, a financial institution's tier 1 capital ratio is its core capital divided by its risk-weighted assets. Financial regulators use this ratio to determine the soundness and stability of the financial system. It forms the basis of the Basel III capital and liquidity standards devised after the financial crisis that led to the Great Recession.The crisis highlighted the fact that many banks had too little capital to absorb losses or remain liquid, were funded with too much debt, and didn't have enough equity.\n\nTo force banks to increase their capital buffers and ensure they can withstand financial distress before they become insolvent, Basel III rules tightened both tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets. The equity component of tier-1 capital must have at least 4.5% of RWAs. The tier 1 capital ratio must be at least 6%.\n\nA firm's\u00a0risk-weighted assets\u00a0include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted forcredit risk. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different\u00a0asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a mortgage loan or car loan would carry more risk.\n\nThe risk-weighted assets would be assigned an increasing weight according to their credit risk. For example, cash might have a weight of 0%, while loans of increasing credit risk would carry weights of 20%, 50%, or 100%.\n\nThe risk-weighted assets that are measured against a bank's core equity capital include all of the assets that the bank holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. For example, a bank's cash on hand and government securities would receive a weighting of 0%, while its mortgage loans would be assigned a 50% weighting.\n\nThe tier 1 capital ratio isn't the only ratio used in the financial industry. The tier 1 common capital ratio and tier 1 leverage ratio are two of these. We've highlighted some of the differences below.\n\nThe tier 1 capital ratio differs slightly from thetier 1 common capital ratio. Tier 1 capital includes the sum of a bank's equity capital, its disclosed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-cumulative\u00a0preferred stock. Tier 1 common capital, on the other hand, excludes all types of preferred stock as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital includes the firm's common stock, retained earnings, and other comprehensive income.\n\nThis ratio is used to determine the adequacy of a financial institution's capital and the degree to which it is capitalized. This ratio is calculated by subtracting the institution's non-controlling interests and preferred stock from its tier 1 capital. The result is then divided by the total risk-controlling assets.\n\nThetier 1 leverage ratiois the relationship between a banking organization's core capital and its total assets. This ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain\u00a0off-balance sheet exposures.\n\nThe tier 1 leverage ratio is used as a tool by central monetary authorities in the same way as tier 1 capital. It ensures the capital adequacy of banks and places constraints on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base, but does not use risk-weighted assets in the denominator.\n\nBasel III also introduced a minimum leverage ratio. This ratio must be at least 3% of the total assets. It's higher for global systemically important banks that are too big to fail. The Basel III Endgame rules have yet to be implemented due to an impasse between the U.S. and European countries.\n\nTier 1 capital is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of theBasel III Accord, a comprehensive framework for bank regulation.\n\nLet's assume that ABC Bank hasshareholders' equityof $3 million and retained earnings of $2 million, so its tier 1 capital is $5 million. The bank has risk-weighted assets of $50 million. Consequently, its tier 1 capital ratio is 10% ($5 million \u00f7 $50 million), and the bank is considered to be well-capitalized compared to the minimum requirement.\n\nBank DEF has retained earnings of $600,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000. This means its tier 1 capital is $1 million. Bank DEF has risk-weighted assets of $25 million. Therefore, bank DEF's tier 1 capital ratio is 4% ($1 million \u00f7 $25 million), which is considered undercapitalized\u00a0because it falls below the minimum tier 1 capital ratio required\u00a0under Basel III.\n\nBank GHI has tier 1 capital of $5 million and risk-weighted assets of $83.33 million. Consequently, bank GHI's tier 1 capital ratio is 6% ($5 million \u00f7 $83.33 million), which is considered adequately capitalized because it meets the minimum tier 1 capital ratio.\n\nTo calculate an institution's Tier 1 capital ratio, divide the Tier 1 capital by the total risk-weighted assets.\n\nTier 1 capital refers to a financial institution's core capital. This is the capital it requires to run its day-to-day operations. Tier 2 capital is any additional capital that it holds in its reserves. Both tiers include different assets that are held by banks. While Tier 1 capital includes shareholders' equity and retained earnings, Tier 2 capital is comprised of funds that don't appear on a bank's financial statements, such as subordinated term debt and hybrid capital instruments, among other things.\n\nThe minimum tier 1 capital ratio required by financial regulators is 6%. Anything under this threshold means that a bank isn't adequately capitalized. This means that a ratio over 6% is desired, so a higher tier 1 capital ratio means it is better able to withstand any financial troubles.\n\nThe financial crisis that led to the Great Recession taught the world a valuable lesson. That is, banks need to ensure they are adequately capitalized to prevent them from failing. Financial regulators adopted stricter rules to make sure that banks meet capital requirements. One of these is maintaining a tier 1 capital ratio of 6%. This ratio is determined by dividing a bank's tier 1 capital by the total risk-weighted assets. A bank is considered capitalized if it meets this threshold. Anything less means that a bank may be in trouble.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"Basel III: international regulatory framework for banks.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"New Capital Rule Community Bank Guide,\" Page 5.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"Definition of Capital in Basel III \u2013 Executive Summary,\" Page 1.\n\nAtlantic Council. \"Basel III Endgame: The Specter of Global Regulatory Fragmentation.\"",
