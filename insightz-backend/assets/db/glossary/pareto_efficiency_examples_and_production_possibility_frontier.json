She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nPareto efficiency, also known as Pareto optimality, describes a situation in which resources are distributed in such a way that improving one person's well-being would inevitably reduce someone else's.\n\nPareto efficiency implies that resources areallocatedin the mosteconomically efficientmanner, but does not imply equality or fairness. An economy is said to be in a Pareto optimum state when no economic changes can make one individual better off without making at least one other individual worse off.\n\nPareto efficiency, named after the Italian economist and political scientist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923), is a major pillar ofwelfare economics.Neoclassical economics, alongside the theoretical construct ofperfect competition, is used as a benchmark to judge the efficiency of real markets\u2014though neither perfectly efficient nor perfectly competitive markets occur outside of economic theory.\n\nHypothetically, if there were perfect competition and resources were used to maximum efficient capacity, then everyone would be at their highest standard of living or Pareto efficiency. Economists Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu demonstrated, theoretically, that under the assumption of perfect competition and where all goods and services are tradeable in competitive markets with zerotransaction costs, an economy will tend toward Pareto efficiency.\n\nIn any situation other than Pareto efficiency, some changes to the allocation of resources in an economy can be made, such that at least one individual gains and no individuals lose from the change. Only changes in the allocation of resources that meet this condition are considered moves toward Pareto efficiency. Such a change is called aPareto improvement.\n\nA Pareto improvement occurs when a change in allocation harms no one and helps at least one person, given an initial allocation of goods for a set of persons. The theory suggests that Pareto improvements will keep enhancing the value of an economy until it achieves a Pareto equilibrium, where no more Pareto improvements can be made. Conversely, when an economy is at Pareto efficiency, any change to the allocation of resources will make at least one individual worse off.\n\nPareto efficiency only deals in absolutes. An allocation of resources is either Pareto efficient or it isn't; there is no degree of efficiency when performing Pareto analysis.\n\nIn practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off, which is why othercriteria of economic efficiencyhave found wider use in economics. This includes:\n\nThese alternative criteria for economic efficiency all to some extent relax the strict requirements of pure Pareto efficiency in the pragmatic interest of real-world policy and decision-making.\n\nAside from applications in economics, the concept of Pareto improvements can be found in many scientific fields, where trade-offs are simulated and studied to determine the number and type of reallocation of resource variables necessary to achieve Pareto efficiency.\n\nIn the business world, factory managers may run Pareto improvement trials, in which they reallocate labor resources to try to boost the productivity of assembly workers without, for example, decreasing the productivity of the packing and shipping workers.\n\nMarket failure occurs when internal and external factors prevent an economy from reaching Pareto efficiency. It is aptly named because, in these situations, the market has failed to allocate optimally or efficiently.\n\nConsider an example of a freepublic goodsuch as a public park. The provider of the park may not be able to exclude individuals who do not contribute tax dollars, donations, or volunteer hours to the park. Therefore, the public good creates an opportunity for individuals to \"free ride\".\n\nIn addition, the consumption of the public good by one individual often does not compete with or reduce the benefit consumed by another individual. Therefore, public goods are often market inefficient because an increase in one person's consumption often does not result in a decrease of value to another.\n\nIn another example, consider a monopoly where a single producer sets the market price. In this monopoly, the market price is often set higher than the marginal cost of the product. Because price and marginal cost are not the same, market efficiency is not achieved and the optimal output is present.\n\nIf any resources are not utilized, Pareto efficiency has not been achieved as the market could have incurred additional units or benefit to some party.\n\nPareto efficiency can be graphically depicted to more easily demonstrate the production possibility frontier. Theproduction possibility frontieris all of the possible combinations of resources that yield market efficiency. Combinations that do not reside on the production possibility frontier are inefficient because additional resources can be allocated.\n\nThe graph below demonstrates thevisualization of the production possibility frontierin a fictional economy that can only produce wine and cotton.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02020\n\nThe quantity of wine produced resides along the y-axis, and the quantity of cotton produced resides along the x-axis. The blue curve with a solid line represents the production possibility frontier where the maximum number of resources are being utilized. There are three different instances outlined in the graph above:\n\nThe importance of Pareto efficiency lies in its ability to serve as a benchmark for evaluating the efficiency of resource allocation in an economy. A Pareto-efficient allocation ensures that resources are allocated in the most efficient manner possible. This ensures that resources, especially scarce commodities, are allocated in the \"best\" way.\n\nPareto efficiency also helps to identify situations where resources are being wasted or underutilized. Using Pareto efficiency tables, analysts or decision-makers can seek to improve the overall efficiency of an economy. This is done by not only looking at how to allocate resources but by analyzing where existing resources may be getting sent and whether there is true benefit with existing allocations.\n\nIn this manner, Pareto efficiency is a useful tool for analyzing the distribution of resources in society. Often, astax revenueis a limited resource, policymakers must take steps to address issues. However, there is also often controversy across departments. For example, should a fire department already be receiving a majority of funds from a city's department, some may feel it inequitable for the department to receive special one-time funds. On the other hand, Pareto efficiency incorporates the value generated by each city entity. Thus, Pareto efficiency is important in balancing equity and value.\n\nEven with its usefulness and strengths, there are limitations to Pareto efficiency. Below are some of the primary drawbacks of the tool.\n\nThere are general variations of Pareto efficiency that dictate how efficient a decision or resource allocation may be. The most strict situation is astrongly Paretoallocation. A resource allocation is considered strongly Pareto efficient if it is not possible to make at least one individual better off without making any other individual worse off. This is a stricter condition than standard Pareto efficiency which only requires that no individual can be made better off without making someone else worse off.\n\nOn the other hand, aweakly Paretoallocation is an opposite variant. This is a less strict condition than standard Pareto efficiency, which only requires that there is no potential Pareto improvement. A weakly Pareto allocation is often associated with an allocation in which everyone is better off in a situation, though nobody is worse off.\n\nArestricted Paretoefficiency takes into account additional constraints or preferences that may exist in a given situation. For example, a resource allocation may be considered Pareto efficient under certainenvironmentalor social constraints. In these cases, even if it is not Pareto efficient under the standard definition, it may be under these special circumstances. Similar to aconstrained Pareto, this concept may take into account that some resources may not be fully utilized due to institutional or legal constraints, and these barriers may be temporary.\n\nTrying to prepare dinner for your family? Having a decision between varying food preferences is an exercise related to Pareto efficiency as resources must be allocated in the most efficient, beneficial way.\n\nConsider a government official reviewing two new programs: a transportation program and a housingstimulus program. The official has $1 million of unallocated public funding to distribute to the programs. Its top choices are:\n\nIn this example, all three choices are Pareto efficient. Because the funds are currently unallocated, there is no allocation that makes one program better off without making the other program worse off. Be mindful that Pareto efficiency does not equate fairness or equity in the allocation.\n\nConsider the two additional options:\n\nThe first additional option is not Pareto efficient because only $1,000,000 of capital is available. In order to award this amount to each of the programs, the official will have to make another program worse off (take funds from that program) to award.\n\nThe second additional option is also not Pareto efficient because resources are not utilized. The unspent $400,000 could have been allocated to the housing program; instead, it was not used.\n\nThree criteria must be met for market equilibrium to occur. There must be exchange efficiency, production efficiency, and output efficiency. Without all three occurring, market efficiency will occur.\n\nPareto efficiency considers the overall distribution efficiency. However, it does not reflect the equity or distribution of resources among parties. Though the distribution of a resource may be efficient, it may not maximize overall social welfare or leave certain negatively impacted parties feeling worse off.\n\nPareto efficiency is supported by perfect competition. This is often in contrast tox-efficiencywith imperfect competition where there is often a greater opportunity for higher returns and better distribution when considering the prospective innovation and growth of the market size.\n\nPareto efficiency is commonly used to compare various economic outcomes of proposed policies. Though the Pareto test has limitations as to which one to choose, it can be an indicator to inform analysts which option is most efficient and allocates resources with the least amount of waste. It is also an important psychological concept that helps decision-makers realize which individuals will be better off and which will be worse off based on market efficiency.\n\nPareto efficiency occurs when an economy is most efficiently allocating its goods. At this point, no further changes to the economy can be made without one party benefiting and one party becoming worse off. Often used to evaluate outcomes of public policy or decisions that impact larger groups of individuals, Pareto efficiency is heavily used in economics to determine competitive equilibrium.\n\nBrookings Institution. \"Kenneth Arrow and the Promise Behavioral Development Economics.\"\n\nCorporate Finance Institute. \"Pareto Efficiency.\"\n\nEconomics Discussion. \"Top Three Marginal Conditions for Pareto Optimality (With Diagram).\"",
