  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nExports are goods and services manufactured or provided by businesses in one country and sold or traded in another. Exports, along withimports, make upinternational trade. Instead of confining themselves within their geographical borders, countries often intentionally seek external markets around the world for commerce, achieving greater revenue and transactional opportunities.\n\nExports are incredibly important to modern economies because they offer people and firms many more markets for their goods. One of the core functions of diplomacy and foreign policy between\u00a0governments is to foster economic trade,encouraging exportsand imports for the benefit of all trading\u00a0parties.\n\nExport agreements are often heavily strategic, with countries exchanging agreements to ensure their own country can not only receive the goods they need via imports but can distribute goods for more domestic revenue via exports.\n\nAlso, governments may use exports as leverage over political situations. In response to the war in Ukraine, the White House issued an executive order prohibiting both the importation and exportation of certain goods to and from Russia.\n\nA country'snet exportsis the difference between the dollar value of its total exports minus its total imports. Because net exports are a component of a country'sgross domestic product (GDP), exports play a factor in determining a country's financial and economic well-being.\n\nGoods may be sent via direct exporting or indirect exporting. Direct exporting entails working directly with an importer. The exporting company handles all of the client communication; as a result, they do not pay a middleman fee.\n\nBecause the direct export method may require teams with specialized knowledge, many companies opt to contract out a third party to facilitate an indirect export.\n\nIn 2023, the world's countries traded almost $31.13 trillion worth of goods. $3.5 trillion of this activity came from China, the world's largest exporter.\n\nMost countries actively seek out overseas trading partners. Instead of blindly manufacturing goods and hoping for an international buyer, the export process may start with a deal between two governments to facilitate cross-border trade.\n\nOnce an order is placed, the seller in the exporting country must receive clearance from their home government to export goods. This may entail obtaining an export license or meeting other country-specific regulations.\n\nThe buyer and exporter must settle several financial matters before shipping the goods. First, the exporter may require a letter of credit from the importer to ensure that they receive compensation. They will also decide who is responsible for the costs of shipping and insurance from the country of origin to the destination.\n\nThey will also fix theexchange ratefor the conversion from foreign currency to the home currency. Once all is agreed, the exporter will issue an invoice to finalize the sale.\n\nAs the order is prepared, formal documents are gathered, including a permit issued by the importer's country, financial documents, such as abill of lading, and shipping documents. Once received, the importer will also be responsible for paying any duties or tariffs of the destination country.\n\nAtrade barrierincludes any government law,\u00a0regulation,\u00a0policy, or practice that is designed to protect domestic products from foreign competition or to artificially\u00a0stimulate exports of particular domestic products.\n\nThe most common foreign trade barriers are government-imposed measures and policies that restrict or impede the international exchange of goods and services. These can includetariffson imported goods orexport restrictionson sensitive technologies.\n\nTrade barriers present a unique set of challenges. Exporters may incur extra costs to research foreign markets and modify products to meet local regulations.\n\nExports facilitate international trade and stimulate domestic economic activity by creating employment, production, and revenue.\n\nCompanies that export are typically exposed to a higher degree of financial risk. Payment collection methods, such as open accounts,letters of credit, prepayment, andconsignment, are inherently complex and take longer to process than payments from\u00a0domestic customers.\n\nCompanies export products and services for a variety\u00a0of reasons. Exports can increase sales and profits\u00a0if the goods create new markets or expand existing ones. They may even present an opportunity to capture significant globalmarket share. Companies that export spread business risk by diversifying into multiple markets.\n\nExporting into foreign markets can often reduce per-unit costs by taking advantage of economies of scale. Finally, companies that export to foreign markets gain new knowledge and experience that may allow the discovery of new technologies, marketing practices, and insights into foreign competitors.\n\nTo export goods, countries may need to incur high transportation costs and the risk of loss due to the transportation of goods. If ownership of the goods does not pass to the buyer until the goods are received, this may make the exportation unduly risky for the exporter.\n\nBecause of logistical and economic constraints, small and medium-sized businesses or governments may find difficulty in exporting goods. In addition, smaller companies often do not have the in-house personnel needed to potentially navigate international trade regulations.\n\nExporting of goods is much more common for larger bodies with greater resources to seek out these outside markets.\n\nLast, exporting to foreign countries may result in currency risk. Depending on exchange rate agreements at the time of contract, a foreign currency's worth may deteriorate, negatively affecting an exporter.\n\nConsider when one currency strengthens against another; if the exporter is to be paid in the currency whose value has depreciated, their export may be devalued. This devaluation may also occur based on extenuating tariffs or lower export prices.\n\nOften allows for greater economic activity leading to higher revenue\n\nMay result in production efficiencies due to scaling manufacturing\n\nMay result in greater innovation and R&D through working with foreign partners\n\nMay reduce operational risk in some areas as revenue streams become more diversified\n\nMay result in high transportation charges\n\nMay not be achievable by smaller entities due to lack of knowledge and resources\n\nMay result in currency exchange risk due to devaluing currencies\n\nMay increase operational risk in some areas due to unknown political or geographical risks\n\nThe United States is one of the top exporters of automotive vehicles. In addition to producing for the local market, U.S.-made cars are sold and shipped around the world to non-U.S. entities.\n\nIn 2024, the Observatory of Economic Complexity reported that the U.S. exported $59.2 billion of vehicles around the world. The U.S. distributed over $15.5 billion worth of vehicles to Canada, making up 26% of car exports. Other top importers of U.S.-made vehicles were Germany, China, the United Arab Emirates, and Mexico.\n\nThe U.S. was also the top importer of vehicles in 2024. It imported $217 billion of cars, most of from Mexico, Japan, South Korea, and Canada.\n\nBMW Manufacturing led domestic companies by the value of cars exported. In 2024, the group's South Carolina plant alone exported over 225,000 vehicles with a total value of over $10 billion.\n\nExport policyrefers to the laws and regulations that dictate how, what, when, and with whom a country exports goods. Export policy defines the tariffs, customs requirements, and limitations on international trade for each country.\n\nMost economic models say that countries should focus on industries where they have acomparative advantage, and import the goods where they have a comparative disadvantage. This allows countries to realize the benefits ofspecializationandeconomies of scale.\n\nHowever, there are also tradeoffs to relying too heavily on global trade: a country that depends on imported goods may lose domestic industries and find itself at the mercy of global markets.\n\nThe U.S.'s largest exports in 2024 were mineral fuels(including oil), machinery, electrical equipment, and vehicles.\n\nAs of 2024, China is the world's largest exporter, followed by the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France.\n\nAs of 2025, the United States is a net importer of physical goods but a net exporter of services. According to the Census Bureau, in February 2025, the total value of exported goods was $182 billion, and the total value of imported goods was $329 billion. In the same month, the U.S. exported $96 billion in services, and imported $72 billion. Taken together, that amounts to net imports of nearly $123 billion.\n\nAn export is a good that is produced domestically but sold to a consumer overseas. Exporting goods can have advantages and disadvantages for both the producer and the countries in which they do business.\n\nDue to resource constraints, economic policy, and manufacturing strategies of each country, it sometimes makes more sense for countries to make goods to sell for revenue as opposed to retaining them for consumption.\n\nThe White House. \"Executive Order on Prohibiting Certain Imports, Exports, and New Investments With Respect to Continued Russian Federation Aggression.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"Exports of Goods and Services.\"\n\nBMW Group. \"BMW Manufacturing Continues As the Largest Automotive Exporter by Value in the United States.\"\n\nWorld's Top Exports. \"United States Top 10 Exports.\"\n\nCensus Bureau. \"US International Trade in Goods and Services, February 2025.\"",
