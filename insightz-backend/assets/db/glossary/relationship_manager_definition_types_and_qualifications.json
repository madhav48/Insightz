Both fields share the common goal of facilitating good relationships so that businesses can maximize the value of those relationships and maintain a good reputation.\n\nGoodrelationship managementis about communication, conflict management, and people skills as much as it is about the technical aspects of a particular business or industry. Professionals in this role may have a bachelor\u2019s ormaster\u2019s degree in business, but they also might have an undergraduate or postgraduate degree inmarketingorcommunications.\n\nStrong communication and coordination skills are needed for facilitating better relationships with clients and other partners. It\u2019s also common for relationship managers to work closely with customer-facing staff to help them better understand clients\u2019 needs and motivate them to provide the highest service standards.\n\nIn addition to communication skills, relationship managers need strong analytical skills to\u00a0develop a deep understanding of the products or services being sold, the markets in which they are being sold, and broader industry trends. The better they understand the technical aspects of the business, the better and more efficient they can be at communicating with clients or partners or helping staff meet the needs of clients or partners.\n\nAtsmaller firms, relationship managers may be responsible for overseeing aspects of both business relationships and client relationships. However, at larger firms, relationship managers are likely to specialize in one area or the other.\n\nA key role of relationship managers is to help businesses differentiate themselves from competitors.\n\nThe goal of client relationship managers is to build a culture of relationships with clients based on trust and value and not only on price.This helps create strong barriers to competition. Clients who know they can trust a particular business are more likely to return even if a less familiar or less trusted competitor offers a lower price.\n\nClient relationship managers work with senior executives, sales managers, technical managers, finance directors, and others who make or influence sales decisions. They also may work directly with clients to address problems or overcome other obstacles.\n\nClient relationship\u00a0managers also monitor industry trends in order to identify new sales opportunities and to brief the product development and sales teams to meet client needs.

They also might\u00a0help set up online ordering and payment systems that simplify the commercial arrangements with clients.\n\nBusiness relationship managers oversee the internal communication of business units within a larger corporation or with suppliers and other outside entities.They oversee teams that monitor purchases, budgeting, and cost factors and\u00a0provide valuable information across business units to\u00a0use resources efficiently and execute company standards.\n\nThis job involves tracking data related to how the business interacts with service suppliers, raw material providers, and other partners. Business relationship managers\u00a0look for trends, handle problems, and analyze communications, contracts, and negotiations. They\u00a0use the information to refine company practices.\n\nHelping firms to maintain positive reputations in their communities is another important role that business relationship managers play. Businesses that are viewed as positive contributors to the community are better able to attract clients and business partners. This means that building positive relationships with local municipalities or downtown development authorities is as important a part of the role of building relationships with other business partners.\n\nGood relationship management is about communication, conflict management, people skills, and the technical aspects of a particular business or industry.\n\nRelationship managers also need to work closely with customer-facing staff in order to help them better understand clients\u2019 needs and motivate them to provide the highest service standards.\n\nThe two main types of relationship manager are:\n\nRelationship managers directly and indirectly help firms improve business relationships with clients and partners.
