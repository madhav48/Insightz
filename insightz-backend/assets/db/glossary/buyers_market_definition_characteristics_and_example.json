  "definition": "A buyer's market is an environment that favors buyers over sellers. It typically develops when changes to the underlying economic conditions that shapesupply and demandmean that purchasers have an advantage over sellers in price negotiations.\n\nA\u00a0buyer's market\u00a0is created by market conditions that favor buyers over sellers. Anything that increases the urgency of sellers to sell or decreases the urgency of buyers to buy contributes to a buyer's market.\n\nA buyer's market usually means that prices are lower, either because buyers have more leverage to negotiate with sellers or because sellers must set lower prices to attract buyers.\n\nIn terms of economic theory, this can be described using thelaw of supply and demand, which states that a supply increase amid constant demand or a decrease in demand with constant supply will put downward pressure on prices.\n\nFactors that can increase supply include:\n\nFactors that can decrease demand, meanwhile, include:\n\nBy changing the shape of supply and demand in a way that implies a lower marketequilibriumprice, these factors can create an advantage for buyers to negotiate for lower prices.\n\nThe term \"buyer's market\" is commonly used to describereal estatemarkets, but it applies to any type of market in which there is more product available than there are people who want to buy it.\n\nThe opposite of a buyer's market is aseller's market, an environment in which supply is low and/or demand is high, giving sellers an advantage over buyers in price negotiations.\n\nIn a real estate buyer's market, houses tend to sell for less and sit on the market for a longer period of time before receiving an offer. More competition in the marketplace occurs between sellers, who often must engage in aprice warto entice buyers to make offers on their homes.\n\nA seller's market, by contrast, is characterized by higher prices and shorter sales times. Rather than sellers competing to attract buyers, the buyers compete against one another for the limited supply of homes available. Consequently, bidding wars between buyers often transpire in a seller's market, resulting in homes selling for more than their list prices.\n\nDuring thehousing bubbleof the early-to-mid 2000s, the real estate market was considered a seller's market. Properties were in high demand and\u00a0likely to sell, even if\u00a0they were overpriced or in poor condition. In many cases, a home would receive multiple offers and the price would be bid up above the seller's initial asking price.\n\nThe subsequent housing market crash created a buyer's market in which a seller had to work much harder to generate interest in their property. A buyer expected a home to be in excellent condition, or pricedat a discount, and could often secure a purchase agreement for less than the seller's asking price for the property.\n\nIn a buyer's market, prices are generally lower and there is less competition. A buyer's market is usually created when there is more supply and lower demand, which means there are more houses than buyers for those houses. Because of this, home sellers must compete to attract homebuyers, which means prices stay lower.\n\nA buyer's market benefits buyers. Buyers have more options from which to choose because supply exceeds demand. Prices stay lower because sellers must compete to attract buyers. Buyers also have more room to negotiate on price and other elements of a sale, such as closing costs in a real estate transaction.\n\nA home's fair market value is not the same thing as its selling price. Fair market value is the property's worth as estimated by a real estate professional. This estimate is usually based on factors such as the age of the house, its condition, location, and the value of similar homes in that location. Selling price is what someone is willing to pay for it in a sale, which can be higher or lower than the fair market value.\n\nA buyer's market is an environment in which buyers have an advantage over sellers. This usually happens when demand exceeds supply. As a result, prices stay low, buyers have a higher number of options to choose from, sellers must keep prices low, and buyers have more room to negotiate.\n\nA buyer's market usually refers to real estate markets. However, it can also be used to describe any market in which buyers have an advantage. The opposite of a buyer's market is a seller's market.",
