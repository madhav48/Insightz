  "term": "Socialism: History, Theory, Analysis, and Examples of Socialist Countries",
  "definition": "Socialism is a populist economic and political system based oncollective, common, or public ownership of the means of production. Those means of production include the machinery, tools, and factories used to produce goods that aim to directly satisfy human needs.\n\nIn contrast tocapitalism, whereby business owners control the means of production and pay wages to workers to use those means, socialism envisions shared ownership and control among the laboring class.\n\nIn a purely socialist system, all production and distribution decisions are made by the collective, directed by a central planner or government body. Worker cooperatives, however, are also a form of socialized production.\n\nSocialist systems tend to have robust welfare systems and social safety nets so that individuals rely on the state for everything from food to healthcare. The government determines the output and pricing levels of these goods and services.\n\nSocialists contend that shared ownership of resources and central planning provide a more equal distribution of goods and services and a more equitable society.\n\nCommon ownership under socialism may take shape throughtechnocratic, oligarchic, totalitarian, democratic, or even voluntary rule. A prominent historical example of a socialist country, albeit one run by communists, is the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), also known as the Soviet Union.\n\nDue to its practical challenges and poor track record, socialism is sometimes referred to as a utopian or \u201cpost-scarcity\u201d system, although modern adherents believe it could work if only properly implemented.\n\nThey argue that socialism creates equality and provides security\u2014a worker\u2019s value comes from the amount of time they work, not in the value of what they produce\u2014while capitalism exploits workers for the benefit of the wealthy.\n\nAs an old socialist slogan describes it, \u201cFrom each according to ability, to each according to need.\u201d\n\nWhile socialism calls for collective or shared ownership of the means of production, it does not imply that there is no private ownership of personal property. Thus, corporations and factories would be shared among the members of society, but individuals and households would still own their own personal effects.\n\nSocialism as a system of shared resources and collective production dates back to the earliest human civilizations. Tribal or clan-based societies would often work for the common good and work together to produce enough food and supplies for the entire population.\n\nCollective agriculture persisted for thousands of years. This was replaced in many places by a sort of feudal system, whereby landed nobility (lords) ruled over peasants (serfs) who worked the land without owning it.\n\nSocialism\u2019s intellectual roots date back to \u201cPlato\u2019s Republic,\u201d in which he described a collective society. Centuries later, Thomas More\u2019s \u201cUtopia\u201d echoed Platonic ideals in its depiction of an imaginary island where people live and work communally.\n\nSocialism was a direct response to the Industrial Revolution, which brought enormous economic and social change to Great Britain and the rest of the world. As industrialists grew wealthy on the labor of workers who increasingly lived in poverty, socialism emerged as an alternative to capitalism, one that could improve life for the working class.\n\nModern socialism developed in opposition to the excesses and abuses of liberal individualism and capitalism.\n\nUnder early capitalist economies during the late 18th and 19th centuries, western European countries experienced industrial production and compound economic growth at a rapid pace. Some individuals and families rose to riches quickly, while others sank into poverty. Capitalism created income inequality and spurred other social concerns.\n\nThe most famous early socialist thinkers were Robert Owen and Henri de Saint-Simon, and laterKarl Marxand thenVladimir Lenin. It was primarily Lenin who expounded on the ideas of earlier socialists and helped bring socialist planning to the national level after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.\n\nFollowing the failure of socialist central planning in the former Soviet Union and Maoist China during the 20th century, many modern socialists adjusted to a high regulatory and redistributive system sometimes referred to as market socialism or democratic socialism.\n\nCritics of socialism contend that it is based on faulty principles and ignores human nature.\n\nCapitalist economies (which today are often synonymous with thefree-marketormarket economies) and socialist economies differ by their logical underpinnings of the structures of ownership and production.\n\nSocialists and free-market economists tend to agree on fundamentaleconomics\u2014the supply and demand framework, for instance\u2014while disagreeing about its proper adaptation and how commodities should be produced.\n\nFunctionally, socialism and free-market capitalism are often divided on two core issues:property rightsandcontrol of production. In a capitalist economy, private individuals and enterprises own the means of production and have the right to profit from them. Private property rights are taken very seriously and apply to nearly everything.\n\nIn a purely socialist economy, the collective owns and controls the means of production; personal property is allowed, but in the form of consumer goods. Essential services like healthcare, education, and public transportation are administered for free by the government and funded through taxation.\n\nIn a socialist economy, public officials known as central planners may control the behavior of producers, consumers, savers, borrowers, andinvestorsby taking over and regulating trade, the flow of capital, and other resources. In a free-market economy, trade is conducted on a voluntary, or nonregulated, basis. However, there are many other ways to coordinate production in a collectivist fashion without such dominating control and loss of personal autonomy.\n\nMarket economies rely on the separate actions of self-determining individuals to determine production, distribution, and consumption. Decisions about what, when, and how to produce are made privately and coordinated through a spontaneously developed price system, and prices are determined by thelaws of supply and demand.\n\nProponents say that freely floating market prices direct resources toward their most efficient ends. Profits are encouraged and drive future production.\n\nSocialist economies rely on either the government or worker cooperatives to drive production and distribution. Consumption is regulated, but it is still partially left up to individuals. The state determines how main resources are used and taxes wealth for redistributive efforts.\n\nSocialist economic thinkers consider many private economic activities to be irrational, such asarbitrageorleverage, because they do not create immediate consumption or use. Still, Marx saw that capitalism was rife with contradictions, class conflict, and self-destructive competition. As a result, he saw socialism as the logical next phase of human political economy.\n\nSeveral philosophical questions also lie at the heart of the debate between socialism and capitalism: What is the role of government? What constitutes a human right? What roles should equality and justice play in society?\n\nCommunismand socialism are umbrella terms referring to two left-wing schools of economic thought. Both oppose capitalism, but socialism predates the \u201cCommunist Manifesto,\u201d an 1848 pamphlet by Marx andFriedrich Engels, by a few decades.\n\nThey are both economic philosophies that advocate for public ownership, particularly over the means of production and the distribution and exchange of goods in a society.\n\nAnd both philosophies run contrary to free-market capitalism, which, they contend, exploits workers and creates a widening gap between rich and poor.\n\nThere are differences between socialism and communism, however. In fact, communism can be thought of as a strict and all-encompassing version of socialism.\n\nUnder communism, all property is communally owned; private property doesn\u2019t exist. Under socialism, individuals can still own private property.\n\nMarx predicted that a violent worker uprising against the middle and upper classes would bring about the communist state, whereas socialists tend to seek change and reform without overthrowing the prevailing social and political structure.\n\nAnd, according to communist theory, workers should be given what they need, while under socialist theory, they are to be compensated for their level of contribution to theeconomy.\n\nThere are many points of contention between socialists and capitalists. Socialists consider capitalism and the free market to be unfair and possibly unsustainable. Most socialists contend that market capitalism is incapable of providing enough subsistence to the lower classes. They contend that greedy owners suppress wages and seek to retain profits for themselves.\n\nProponents of market capitalism counter that it is impossible for socialist economies to allocate scarce resources efficiently without real market prices. They claim that the resultant shortages, surpluses, and political corruption will lead to more poverty, not less. Overall, they say, socialism is impractical and inefficient, suffering in particular from two major challenges.\n\nThe first challenge for socialism, widely called the \u201cincentive problem,\u201d is that no one wants to be a sanitation worker or to wash skyscraper windows. That is, socialist planners cannot incentivize laborers to accept dangerous or uncomfortable jobs without violating the equality of outcomes.\n\nFar more serious is the calculation problem, a concept originating from economist Ludwig von Mises\u2019 1920 article \u201cEconomic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nSocialists, wrote Mises, are unable to perform any real economic calculation without a pricing mechanism. Without accurate factor costs, no true accounting may take place. Withoutfutures markets, capital can never reorganize efficiently over time.\n\nWhile socialism and capitalism seem diametrically opposed, most capitalist economies today have somesocialist aspects. Elements of a market economy and a socialist economy can be combined into amixed economy.\n\nIn fact, most modern countries operate with a mixed economic system; government and private individuals both influence production and distribution.\n\nEconomist and social theorist Hans-Hermann Hoppe wrote that there are only two archetypes in economic affairs\u2014socialism and capitalism\u2014and that every real system is a combination of these archetypes.\n\nBut because of the archetypes\u2019 differences, there is an inherent challenge in the philosophy of a mixed economy and it becomes a never-ending balancing act between predictable obedience to the state and the unpredictable consequences of individual behavior.\n\nThe Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic have increased interest in the government creating more opportunities and increasing the social safety net for all Americans. These are hallmarks of socialist policy, and not everyone agrees with such ideas.\n\nMixed economies are still relatively young, and theories around them have only recently been codified. \u201cThe Wealth of Nations,\u201dAdam Smith\u2019s pioneering economic treatise, argued that markets were spontaneous and that the state could not direct them or the economy.\n\nLater economists, includingJean-Baptiste Say, F.A. Hayek,Milton Friedman, andJoseph Schumpeter, would expand on this idea.\n\nHowever, in 1985, political economy theorists Wolfgang Streeck and Philippe C. Schmitter introduced the term \u201ceconomic governance\u201d to describe markets that are not spontaneous but have to be created and maintained by institutions.To pursue its objectives, the state needs to create a market that follows its rules.\n\nHistorically, mixed economies have followed two trajectories:\n\nThe first trajectory assumes that private individuals have the right to own property, produce, and trade. State intervention has developed gradually, usually in the name of protecting consumers, supporting industries crucial to the public good (in fields like energy or communications), providing welfare, or other aspects of the social safety net. Most Western democracies, such as the United States, follow this model.\n\nThe second trajectory relates to states that evolved from pure collectivist or totalitarian regimes. Individuals\u2019 interests are considered a distant second in importance to state interests, but elements of capitalism are adopted to promote economic growth. China and Russia are examples of the second model.\n\nPrivate businesses now produce more than half of China\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) and most of its exports.\n\nToday, veryfew countries are close to pure socialism. Perhaps China is the most prominent example, with a communist government that effectivelynationalizesmany of the nation\u2019s key industries.\n\nState-owned enterprises are a key feature of the Chinese economy, although several steps toward capitalism and liberalization have created certain economic zones (e.g., in Shanghai) where private corporations can co-exist and profit.\n\nCuba remained closer to a Marxist-Leninist socialist economy, following its communist revolution in 1959 and the installation of Fidel Castro as its leader. After Castro\u2019s death, however, Cuba, too, saw some liberalization.\n\nIn 2019, Cubans voted for a new constitution that granted private property rights and greater access to free markets, while preserving the socialist political system.\n\nThe last remaining Marxist-Leninist socialist economy that has not seen any reforms is that of North Korea. The country remains ruled by a communist dictatorship and a closedcommand economygoverned by strict central planning.\n\nLaos, another country in Asia, is also a socialist state, but is more open than North Korea.\n\nA nation needs to transfer the means of production to transition from socialism to free markets. The process of transferring functions and assets from central authorities to private individuals is known asprivatization.\n\nPrivatization occurs whenever ownership rights transfer from a coercive public authority to a private actor, whether it is a company or an individual.\n\nDifferent forms of privatization include contracting out to private firms, awarding franchises, and the outright sale of governmentassets, ordivestiture.\n\nIn some cases, privatization is not really privatization. Case in point: private prisons. Rather than completely ceding a service to competitive markets and the influence of supply and demand, private prisons in the United States are actually just a contracted-out governmentmonopoly.\n\nThe scope of functions that form the prison is largely controlled by government laws and executed by government policy. It is important to remember that not all transfers of government control result in a free market.\n\nCuba has moved toward privatizing many aspects of its economy, incorporating more capitalism into its society. In early 2021, it began allowing people to work in jobs in over 2,000 private sectors, up from 127.\n\nSome nationwide privatization efforts have been relatively mild, while others have been dramatic. The most striking examples include the former satellite nations of the Soviet Bloc after the collapse of the USSR and the modernization of the post-Mao Chinese government.\n\nThe privatization process involves several different kinds of reforms, not all of them completely economic.\n\nThe logistical problems associated with these actions have not been fully resolved, and several different theories and practices have been offered throughout history.\n\nShould these transfers be gradual or immediate? What are the impacts of shocking an economy built around central control? Can firms be effectively depoliticized?\n\nAs the struggles in Eastern Europe in the 1990s show, it can be very difficult for a population to adjust from complete state control to suddenly having political and economic freedoms.\n\nIn Romania, for example, the National Agency for Privatization was charged with the goal of privatizing commercial activity in a controlled manner. Private ownership funds, or POFs, were created in 1991.\n\nThe state ownership fund, or SOF, was given the responsibility of selling 10% of the state\u2019s shares each year to the POFs, allowing prices and markets to adjust to a new economic process.\n\nBut initial efforts failed as progress was slow and politicization compromised many transitions. Further control was given to more government agencies and, over the course of the next decade, abureaucracytook over what should have been a private market.\n\nThese failures are indicative of the primary problem with gradual transitions. When political actors control the process, economic decisions continue to be based on noneconomic justifications.\n\nA quick transition may result in the greatest initial shock and the most initial displacement, but it results in the fastest reallocation of resources toward the most valued, market-based ends.\n\nYes. Social welfare programs such as food stamps, unemployment compensation, and housing assistance can be described as socialist. It can also be argued that government programs like Medicare and Social Security are, too. There are also socialist organizations in the U.S., such as the Democratic Socialists of America, which counts among its members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), Cori Bush (D-Mo.), and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) of the House of Representatives. And Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is a self-described democratic socialist.\n\nOther examples of socialism in the U.S. include organizations like worker co-ops,credit unions, public libraries, and public schools.\n\nSocial democracy is based on maintaining a capitalist economic system but blunting its excesses via regulation and addressing inequality with government-run social programs\u2014in a sense, humanizing capitalism. Social democracies exist today inDenmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden.\n\nDemocratic socialism has a vision of a society and economy that is democratic, not authoritarian, in which individuals have more of a say than large corporations in how the economy is run. It is committed to finding ways to transform an economy from capitalism to socialism. As thewebsiteof the Democratic Socialists of America notes, \u201cOur vision pushes further than historic social democracy and leaves behind authoritarian visions of socialism in the dustbin of history....We want to collectively own the key economic drivers that dominate our lives, such as energy production and transportation.\u201d\n\nThis question is a matter of debate and political ideology.\n\nCapitalism has seen the greatest rise in wealth and standards of living in human history, accompanied by innovation and invention. However, capitalism\u2014driven by fierce competition for profits and market share\u2014has also been blamed for rising wealth disparities, social inequalities, alienation, exploitation, and the misery of the working class.\n\nSocialism, on the other hand, promises egalitarianism by returning the means of production to the laboring class. In doing so, wealth disparities are greatly minimized and society as a whole may flourish. However, collective ownership and less competition might put a damper on innovation and technological progress. Furthermore, people are often wary of giving up personal freedom (although it may benefit the greater good) as governments direct production and consumption choices.\n\nToday, most countries in the world feature some aspects of socialism\u2014even in the United States, but especially in countries found in Europe and Asia. Only a few are full-blown pure socialist (Marxist-Leninist communist) economies: the People\u2019s Republic of China, Cuba, Laos, Vietnam, and North Korea. (The USSR also was, but the Soviet Union collapsed in the 1990s.)\n\nThe economic and political system of socialism has been a part of human existence, in theory or practice, for many centuries. It espouses the collective ownership of the means of production and places the importance of state control above that of the individual.\n\nProponents believe that it creates equality and provides workers with security. Critics claim that it neglects essential human behavior. Socialism contrasts with capitalism, a system based on a free-market economy and private ownership.\n\nLuc Bovens and Adrien Lutz, via SSRN. \u201c\u2018From Each According to Ability; To Each According to Needs\u2019 Origin, Meaning, and Development of Socialist Slogans.\u201dHistory of Political Economy, Vol. 51, No. 2 (2019), Pages 237\u2013257.\n\nHistory.com. \u201cHow Are Socialism and Communism Different?\u201d\n\nMises Institute. \u201cEconomic Calculation in the Socialist Commonwealth.\u201d\n\nMises Institute. \u201cA Theory of Socialism & Capitalism.\u201d\n\nEncyclop\u0153dia Britannica. \u201cThe Wealth of Nations.\u201d\n\nWolfgang Streeck and Philippe C.
