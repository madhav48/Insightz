  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe net interest rate differential (NIRD), in international currency (forex) markets, is the total difference in the interest rates of two distinct national economies.\n\nFor instance, if a trader is long theNZD/USD pair, they will own the New Zealand currency and borrow the U.S. currency. The New Zealand dollars in this case can be placed in a New Zealand bank earning interest while simultaneously taking out a loan for the samenotional amountfrom a U.S. bank. The net interest rate differential is the after-tax, after-fee difference in any interest earned and any interest paid while holding the currency pair position.\n\nGenerally, aninterest rate differential(IRD) measures the contrast in interest rates between two similar interest-bearing assets. Traders in the forex market use interest rate differentials when pricing forward exchange rates. Based on theinterest rate parity, a trader can create an expectation of the future exchange rate between two currencies and set the premium, or discount, on the current market exchange rate\u00a0futures contracts. The net interest rate differential is specific to use in currency markets.\n\nThe net interest rate differential is a key component of thecarry trade. A carry trade is a strategy that foreign exchange traders use in an attempt to profit from the difference between interest rates, and if traders arelonga currency pair, they may be able to profit from a rise in the currency pair. While the carry trade does earn interest on the net interest rate differential, a move in the underlying currency pair spread could easily fall (as it has historically) and risk wiping out the benefits of the carry trade leading to losses.\n\nThe currency carry trade remains one of the most populartrading strategiesin the currency market. The best way to first implement a carry trade is to determine which currency offers a high yield and which offers a lower one.\u00a0The most popular carry trades nowadays involve buyingcurrency pairslike the USD/JPY and the AUD/JPY since these have interest rate spreads that are high enough to benefit from, but use relatively stable currencies.\n\nThe NIRD is the amount the investor can expect to profit using a carry trade. Say an investor borrows $1,000 and converts the funds into British pounds, allowing them to purchase a British bond. If the purchasedbond yields7% and the equivalent U.S. bond yields 3%, then the IRD equals 4%, or 7% minus 3%.\u00a0This profit is ensured only if the exchange rate between dollars and pounds remains constant.\n\nOne of the primary risks involved with this strategy is the uncertainty of currency fluctuations. In this example, if the British pound were to fall in relation to the U.S. dollar, the trader may experience losses. Additionally, traders may useleverage, such as with a factor of 10-to-1, to improve their profit potential. If the investor leveraged borrowing by a factor of 10-to-1, they could make a profit of 40%. However, leverage could also cause larger losses if there are significant movements in exchange rates that go against the trade.",
