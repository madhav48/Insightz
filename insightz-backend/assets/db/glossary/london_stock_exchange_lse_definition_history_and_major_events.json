  "definition": "The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is the primary stock exchange in the United Kingdom and its largest. Originating more than 300 years ago, the regional exchanges were merged in 1973 to form the Stock Exchange of Great Britain and Ireland, later renamed the London Stock Exchange (LSE). TheFinancial Times Stock Exchange(FTSE) 100 Share Index, or \"Footsie\", is the dominant index, containing 100 of the top blue-chip stocks on the LSE.\n\nThe stock exchange is physically located in the city of London. In 2007, the London Stock Exchange merged with the Milan Stock Exchange,\u00a0the Borsa Italiana,\u00a0to form the\u00a0London Stock Exchange Group.\n\nLondon has long been one ofthe world's leading financial cities, well-known as a hub for international trade, banking, and insurance. The history of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) goes back to 1698 when broker John Castaing began posting the prices of stocks and commodities at Jonathan's Coffee House, which was a popular meeting place for businessmen to conduct trades. Castaing called his price list \"The Course of the Exchange and Other Things.\"\n\nBy 1801 it became clear that a formal system was needed to deter fraud and unscrupulous traders. Brokers agreed to a set of rules and paid a membership fee to belong to the exchange, thus paving the way for the first regulated stock exchange in London.\n\nThrough its primary markets, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) provides cost-efficient access to some of the world\u2019s deepest and most liquid pools of capital. It is home to a wide range of companies and provideselectronic\u00a0equities tradingfor listed companies.\n\nThe LSE is the most international of all stock exchanges with thousands of companies from more than 60 countries, and it is the premier source of equity-market liquidity, benchmark prices, and market data in Europe. Linked by partnerships to international exchanges in Asia and Africa, the LSE intends to remove cost and regulatory barriers fromcapital marketsworldwide.\n\nOn Oct. 27, 1986, the U.K. government deregulated the London stock market. Known as the \"Big Bang\" because of the massive changes that immediately ensued, deregulation introduced electronic trading to the London Stock Exchange, which replaced traditionalopen outcrytrading. The new system was efficient and faster, allowing trading volumes to increase and enabling the LSE to successfully rival other global exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nThe Big Bang was part of the government's reform program to eliminate overregulation and encouragefree-market competition. It introduced other significant changes to the structure of the financial markets. These include the elimination of minimum fixed commissions on trades and the removal of the separation between companies that traded stocks and those that advised investors.\n\nThese changes increased competition among brokerage companies and led to a series of mergers and acquisitions. Another Big Bang change allowed foreign ownership of U.K. brokers, which opened London's market to international banks.\n\nThe Main Market of the London Stock Exchange\u00a0is\u00a0one of the world's most\u00a0diverse stock markets\u00a0with companies making up\u00a040 different\u00a0sectors.\u00a0A listing on the LSE's Main Market gives companies access to real-time pricing;\u00a0deep pools of capital;benchmarkingthrough the FTSE UK Index Series; and significant levels of\u00a0media coverage, research, and announcements.\n\nThere are a number of different ways for companies to join\u00a0the Main Market, including the following:\n\nThe Premium segment applies only\u00a0to equity shares issued by commercial trading companies. Premium listing issuers are required to meet the UK\u2019s super-equivalent rules.

A company with a Premium listing also has the possibility of being included in one of theFTSE indices.\n\nThe Standard segment is open to the issuing of equity shares,Global Depositary Receipts(GDRs), debt securities,\u00a0and\u00a0derivatives that must comply with minimum requirements. The overall compliance burden is lighter for companies with a Standard listing. A Standard listing helps companies from emerging markets attract investments from London's large pool of available capital.\n\nThe Specialist Fund Segment is\u00a0designed specifically for high growth, revenue-generating businesses, and\u00a0highly specialized investment entities that\u00a0targetinstitutional investorsor professionally advised investors, respectively. This segment is for companies that are not eligible for a Premium or Standard listing but are seeking funding to grow their companies.\n\nApart from the London Stock Exchange (LSE) itself, the LSEG also owns FTSE Russell, Refinitiv, and LCH Clearing.\n\nThe LSE was formed in 1801 as London's first regulated exchange.\n\nThe largest companies by market cap listed on the LSE as of June 21, 2023, are:\n\nThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) is the main stock exchange in the United Kingdom and one of the largest stock exchanges in the world.
