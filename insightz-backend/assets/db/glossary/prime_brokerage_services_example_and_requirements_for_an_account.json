Services provided under prime brokering includesecurities lending,\u00a0leveraged trade execution, and cash management.\n\nBrokerage clients who trade frequently in large volumes often need to be able to borrow securities or cash to engage innetting, which offsets the value of multiple positions or payments exchanged between two or more parties.\n\nPrime brokerage services are provided by most of the largest financial services firms, including Goldman Sachs, UBS, and Morgan Stanley. Such services have been available since the 1970s.\n\nPrime\u00a0brokerage services\u00a0revolve\u00a0around facilitating the busy, multifaceted trading operations of large financial institutions, such\u00a0ashedge funds. Central to their role, prime brokers allow hedge funds to borrow securities and increase theirleverage, while also acting as an intermediary between hedge funds and counterparties such as pension funds and commercial banks.\n\nPrime brokerages, at times referred to asprime brokers, are generally larger financial institutions that have dealings with other major institutions and hedge funds.

In essence, a prime brokerage service gives large institutions a mechanism allowing them to outsource many of their investment activities and shift focus ontoinvestment goalsand strategy.\n\nConcierge-style services may also be offered by prime brokerages. These can includerisk management, capital introduction, securities financing, and cash financing.Some go as far as to offer the opportunity to sublease office space and provide access to other facility-based benefits.

These varieties of investors often deal with a large amount of cash for investment but don't have the internal resources to manage the investments on their own.\n\nThe minimum account size to open and obtain prime brokerage account services is $500,000 in equity; however, an account of that size is unlikely to get many benefits over and above what would be offered by discount brokers.\n\nSome of the largest prime brokers in the U.S. areinvestment banks, including Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.\n\nFor hedge funds or other institutional clients to get the kind of services that make having a prime brokerage account worthwhile (most notably discounted fees for trading), an account size of $50 million in equity is a likely starting point.\n\nEven so, these services are highly sought after by clients and the best banks only accept the clients that are most likely to be beneficial to them over time.

Morgan will assume the responsibilities of managing ABC's cash management, calculating itsnet asset value (NAV)on a monthly basis, and performing a risk management analysis on its portfolio. For these services, it is agreed that J.P. Morgan will charge a monthly fee of $20,000.\n\nAfter six months, ABC has grown and its investment strategy has become more complex. It needs to borrow securities as part of its investment strategy and transacts with J.P. Morgan to provide securities lending services. For this, J.P. Morgan charges 5% on the amount of money borrowed. ABC also engages with J.P. Morgan for capital introduction services, whereby J.P. Morgan introduces ABC to potential investors, charging 2% of the invested amount by each investor.\n\nAll these services that J.P. Morgan provides to hedge fund ABC constitute prime brokerage services.\n\nA broker is an individual or entity that facilitates the purchase or sale of securities, such as the buying or selling of stocks and bonds for an investment account.
