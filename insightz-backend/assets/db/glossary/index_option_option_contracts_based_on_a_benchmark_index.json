  "definition": "manusapon kasosod / Getty Images\n\nAn index option is a financial derivative that gives the holder the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the value of an underlyingindex, such as the S&P 500 index, at the stated exercise price. No actual stocks are bought or sold. Often, an index option will utilize anindex futurescontract as its underlying asset.\n\nIndex options are alwayscash-settledand are typicallyEuropean-style options, meaning they settle only on the date of maturity and have no provision for early exercise.\n\nIndexcallandputoptions are popular tools used to trade the general direction of an underlying index while putting very little capital at risk. The profit potential for index call options is unlimited, while the risk is limited to the premium paid for the option.\n\nFor index put options, the risk is also limited to the premium paid, while the potential profit is capped at the index level, less the premium paid, as the index can never go below zero.\n\nBeyond potentially profiting from general index-level movements,index optionscan be used to diversify a portfolio when an investor is unwilling to invest directly in the index's underlying stocks. Index options can also be used tohedgespecific risks in a portfolio.\n\nThe busiest index options in the U.S. market are options on SPXW (representing the S&P 500) and VIX, the Cboe Volatility Index.\n\nNote that whileAmerican-style optionscan be exercised at any time before expiry, index options tend to be European-style and can be exercised only on the expiration date.\n\nRather than tracking an index directly, most index options actually utilize an index futures contract as the underlying security. An\u00a0option\u00a0on an S&P 500 futures contract, therefore, can be thought of as a second derivative of the S&P 500 index since the futures are themselves derivatives of the index.\n\nAs such, there are more variables to consider as both the option and the futures contract haveexpiration datesand their own risk/reward profiles. With such index options, the contract has a multiplier that determines the overallpremium, or price paid. Usually, the multiplier is 100. The S&P 500, however, has a 250x multiplier.\n\nImagine a hypothetical index called Index X, which currently has a level of 500. Assume an investor decides to purchase a call option on Index X with astrike priceof 505. If this 505 call option is priced at $11, the entire contract costs $1,100\u2014or $11 x a 100 multiplier.\n\nIt is important to note the underlying asset in this contract is not any individual stock or set of stocks, but rather the cash level of the index adjusted by the multiplier. In this example, it is $50,000, or 500 x $100. Instead of investing $50,000 in the stocks of the index, an investor can buy the option at $1,100 and utilize the remaining $48,900 elsewhere.\n\nThe risk associated with this trade is limited to $1,100. The break-even point of an index call option trade is the strike price plus the premium paid. In this example, that is 516, or 505 plus 11. At any level above 516, this particular trade becomes profitable.\n\nIf the index level is 530 at expiration, the owner of this call option wouldexerciseit and receive $2,500 in cash from the other side of the trade, or (530 \u2013 505) x $100. Less the initial premium paid, this trade results in a profit of $1,400.\n\nCommon index options strategies include (1) long call/long put, (2) covered call/protective put, (3) straddle, and (4) strangle.\n\nBecause traders are unlikely to hold options for more than a year, these instruments are taxed as short-term capital gains. However, broad-based index options are taxed according to the 60/40 rule: 60% of the gains are treated as long-term gains, and 40% as short-term gains, regardless of the holding period. These tax advantages give broad-based index options an advantage over other options instruments.\n\nWhen you trade an index option, you are actually buying the right to buy or sell a futures contract on the underlying index. Since these futures are themselves derivatives, an index option can be considered a second derivative of the underlying index.\n\nIndex options give traders the ability to hedge their portfolios with exposure to a broad cross-section of the market. As with other options, it is important to understand how expiration dates and strike prices affect their value. Unlike some other options, index options are usually cash-settled and cannot be redeemed before their expiration date.\n\nNasdaq. \"Understanding the Tax Advantages of Index Options.\"",
