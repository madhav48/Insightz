  "definition": "How to tailor your strategies for allocating stocks, bonds, and other investments\n\nGordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA portfolio investment is ownership of a stock, bond, or other financial asset with the expectation that it will earn a return or grow in value over time.\n\nA portfolio investment involves acquiring and managing an array of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other securities while balancing risk and maximizing returns over time. Most Americans report feeling uncomfortable with the choices available to them, however, and being unready to tackle their portfolio investments.\n\nA 2024 report from the U.S. Federal Reserve painted a stark picture: most Americans in the lower 90% of income earners felt adrift when managing their investment portfolios. More alarming is that two-thirds of non-retirees say they're not on track in saving for retirement.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nDavid Tenerelli, a certified financial planner at Strategic Financial Planning in Plano, Texas, said that it's not hard to see why portfolio investing might seem \"opaque\" to many with many financial products on offer from so many companies and given the profound changes in the financial markets over the past half century or so,\n\n\"But in reality, today it\u2019s easier than ever to put together a diversified, low-cost portfolio for any risk profile and time horizon,\" Tenerelli said. \"Resources for investors of all experience levels abound. Knowledge is power, but you don\u2019t have to become a financial prodigy to set yourself up for long-term success.\"\n\nLearning the art of constructing and managing portfolio investments isn't just a skill for finance professionals. It's a necessity for anyone hoping to build long-term financial security given the vast changeover since the early 1980s from defined pension plans to 401(k)s for retirement planning.\n\nTenerelli noted that you don't have to go it alone. \"Working with an advisor can help investors avoid pitfalls and approach optimization while integrating their investment planning with the rest of their financial situation, such as tax planning, estate planning, and insurance/risk analysis.\" Knowing how portfolio investing works is a benefit, however, whether you're a do-it-yourselfer or someone who feels better handing off your financials to professionals.\n\nThe ability to effectively choose investments for your portfolio can be the defining factor between a future marked by financial anxiety and one characterized by stability and relative comfort.\n\nPortfolio investment involves assembling a collection of financial assets with the goal of achieving specificfinancial goalswhile managing risk. The approach recognizes that assets perform differently under various economic conditions and some have greater risks with a greater potential for rewards than others.\n\nPortfolio investments come from a range of asset classes including stocks, government bonds, corporate bonds, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), andcertificates of deposit. Your portfolio might also include more esoteric choices such as derivatives like options and futures or physical assets like real estate, commodities, and art and collectibles.\n\nAsset allocation is the process of determining how much of your portfolio to dedicate to each type of investment. This decision should be based on your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment timeline. A young professional saving for retirement might have a higher allocation to stocks for growth potential, while a retiree might lean more heavily toward bonds for income and stability.\n\nThese styles typically range from conservative to aggressive,e with many variations in between:\n\nEach style offers a different balance of potential risk and reward, allowing investors to align their portfolios with their financial circumstances and objectives.\n\nDiversification is the cornerstone of portfolio investments. Investors can cut the effect of any single asset\u2019s poor performance by spreading investments across different asset classes, sectors, and geographical regions. This strategy helps to mitigate risk and can lead to more stable returns.\n\n\"At a basic level, a diversified portfolio will probably include at least some stocks and some bonds,\" Tenerelli said. He advised that those beginning with portfolio investments should look at ETFs and index or passive mutual funds, which are \"the easiest, lowest-cost way\" to assemble a portfolio that meets most people's needs.\n\n\"However, more research is warranted if investors wish to 'slice and dice' or 'tilt' their portfolio toward certain asset subclasses such as small-cap value or emerging markets,\" he said, \"or if they wish to invest in more esoteric asset classes such as derivatives or private equity.\"\n\nThere are several approaches for diversifying a portfolio:\n\nPortfolio investing can be divided into two main categories.Strategicinvesting involves acquiring assets that are expected to grow significantly over time or generate consistent income. Thetacticalapproach involves active trading to capitalize on short-term market movements.\n\nA key aspect of risk management is understanding and adjusting for your risk tolerance which can change over time because of age, changes in finances, need for liquidity, and market conditions. This might involve gradually shifting to more conservative financial products as retirement approaches or adjusting strategies during periods of high market volatility.\n\nYou can use tools likestop-loss ordersto automatically sell assets if they fall below a certain price or employ options strategies to hedge against potential losses.\n\nManaging risk also includes accounting for the risk-return trade-offs of each financial product. Lower risk levels generally correspond to lower potential returns. Higher risk levels are associated with higher potential returns. This chart represents the risk/return relationship with a higher risk typically but not always related to higher potential rewards.\n\nInvestment horizons range from the short term such as hours, days, or weeks to much longer spans such as years and decades. Post-college professionals with401(k) planswould have investment horizons of decades. A day trader's horizon doesn't last beyond the trading on any given.\n\nPortfolios that have shorter time horizons should generally be those where investors are willing to take on less risk, such as when retirement is imminent.\u00a0The longer the horizon, the greater the risks you can take because you have time to make up for shortfalls. A longer-term investor may hold what are considered riskier types of equities such as mid-cap, small-cap, or high-growth stocks.\n\nThose with a greater risk tolerance may favor investments in growth stocks, real estate, international securities, and options. More conservative investors generally opt for government bonds andblue-chip stocks.\n\nYou must also decide whether you want to actively or passively engage with your portfolio investments. Active management involves buying and selling assets to outperform the market and it often requires extensive research and analysis. Passive management aims to replicate the performance of a specific index or benchmark, offering a cost-effective and lower-maintenance investment option.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) is a passively managed fund that tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Index for long-term investors. The fund manager replicates the holdings by weight of the S&P 500's large-cap stocks.\n\nThe type and amount of assets you'll choose for your portfolio investments will often depend in part on their tax efficiency. Different assets and accounts are subject to varyingtax treatmentswhich can greatly impact your returns in the long run. Using tax-advantaged accounts can help minimize tax liabilities and increase your after-tax returns.\n\nAsset classes are sets of investments that share similar characteristics and behave similarly in the marketplace. These are the most commonly traded.\n\nEquities represent ownership in a company and are typically traded on stock exchanges or over-the-counter (OTC) markets. Investors can earn returns from equities in two ways: capital appreciation or increases in the stock price and dividends or periodic payments to shareholders. There are two main types of equities:\n\nStocks are generally considered riskier than other asset classes but they can deliver higher returns over the long term. Their performance is influenced by company performance, market conditions, and broader economic trends.\n\nFixed-income securities are investments that provide returns through regular interest payments and the return of principal atmaturity. They have several features:\n\nBonds play a crucial role in many portfolio investments, providing income stability and often serving as a counterbalance to the higher volatility of stocks. Investors should consider interest rate and credit risks, however, as well as the potential impact of inflation.\n\nCash and cash equivalents form a crucial component of many portfolios, offering stability and liquidity. This asset class includes cash, bank deposits, money market funds, short-term government securities such as Treasury bills, and highly liquid, short-term debt instruments.\n\nThese assets are characterized by their highliquidity, meaning they can be quickly converted to cash with little to no loss of value. They typically offer lower returns than stocks or bonds but provide a safety net and ready funds for immediate needs or investment prospects.\n\nWhile cash and cash equivalents offer stability and liquidity, theydon't necessarily keep pace with inflationover the long term. Holding onto these assets often results in a gradual erosion of purchasing power. Investors, therefore, usually have to balance liquidity and safety with higher-yielding investments to achieve their long-term financial goals.\n\nAlternative portfolio investmentsare a broad category of assets that falloutside the traditionallist of stocks, bonds, and cash. Many alternative investments have low liquidity. They can be difficult to buy or sell quickly. They're also often associated with higher potential returns but also higher risk. They can require far greater knowledge or expertise.\n\nReal estate investing involves buying, owning, managing, selling, or financing real estate properties to generate profit.Real estate investmentsfall into two main categories:\n\nReal estate can generate income through rent and can appreciate in the long term but it also comes with risks such as market fluctuations. Property values and income are often greatly affected by changes in the overall economy, interest rates, and local market conditions. Maintenance costs, vacancies, and liquidity risks are all risks that come with investing in real estate.\n\nCommodities are the oldest traded goods. They're typically raw materials or agricultural products that are traded either OTC or on exchanges like theChicago Board of Trade. Common examples include precious metals including gold, silver, and copper, energy resources such as oil and natural gas, agricultural products like wheat, corn, and livestock, and industrial metals such as copper and aluminum. These investments offer several features:\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to commodities through direct ownership, futures contracts whose value is based on their expected value, commodity-linked ETFs and mutual funds, and shares in commodity-producing companies.\n\nAccording to J.P. Morgan Chase, alternative investments hit a record high during the pandemic at about 15.5% of all portfolio investments. This was down to about 14.9% at the end of 2023.\n\nCommodities can offer portfolio diversification and potential inflation protection but they also come with unique risks including storage costs for physical commodities, complex pricing, and high sensitivity to global economic and political events.\n\nAlternative portfolio investments typically include the following in addition to real estate and commodities:\n\nSuppose you have $100,000 to invest. You decide to build a diversified portfolio with the following asset allocation:\n\nThe portfolio is designed to provide exposure to various asset classes with different risk and return characteristics. The bulk goes to stocks for growth potential, with a significant portion in U.S. large-cap firms for stability. Bonds provide income and help mitigate overall portfolio risk. REITs offer exposure to the real estate market.\n\nThe initial investment of $100,000 meets its target percentages, but the portfolio investment allocations will shift as the markets move. The equity portion may grow to 65% of the portfolio if stocks have a strong year.\n\nYou must periodically rebalance your portfolio to maintain the intended risk profile. This means selling portions of the outperforming assets and using the proceeds to buy underperforming assets. You can return the allocation to the original 60% stock / 35% bond / 5% REIT mix in this way.\n\nYou'll generate returns or losses that blend the returns of the individual asset classes in the long term. This diversification helps smooth out volatility compared with investing in one asset class or another.\n\nYou'll want to start with having an understanding of the different asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and real estate and then assessing your investment goals and risk tolerance. Aim for diversification by including a mix of these asset classes to mitigate risk and select specific investments within each category.\n\nRegularly review and rebalance your portfolio to maintain your desired asset allocation and consider seeking professional advice if needed to tailor your strategy to your finances, risk tolerance, and goals.\n\nTenerelli told Investopedia, \"The first step is to determine whether that portfolio is right for your goals, objectives, risk profile, and time horizon.\" He advised that the process should include a comprehensive analysis of your finances and a detailed review of your portfolio's composition.\n\nA balanced portfolio typically combines a mix of asset classes, including equities, bonds, and perhaps a low percentage of alternative investments, to achieve your desired level of risk and return.\n\nA traditional strategy is the60/40 portfoliowhich allocates 60% to stocks for growth potential and 40% to bonds for stability and income. This approach aims to provide capital appreciation and income generation while managing risk through diversification because different asset classes often react differently to market conditions.\n\nPortfolio investments involve acquiring diverse financial assets to generate returns over time, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and commodities. Investors canmitigate riskand potentially improve their returns by diversifying across different asset classes because various assets often respond differently to changing market conditions.\n\nU.S. Federal Reserve. \"Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2023.\" Pages 67-70.\n\nH.
