  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe discount yield is a way of calculating a bond's return when it is sold at a discount to itsface value, expressed as a percentage. Discount yield is commonly used to calculate the yield on municipal notes, commercial paper and treasury bills soldat a discount.\n\nDiscount yield is calculated as and the formula uses a 30-day month and 360-day year to simplify the calculation.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021\n\nDiscount yield computes adiscount bondinvestor'sreturn on investment(ROI) if the bond is held until maturity. ATreasury billis issued at a discount frompar value(face amount), along with many forms of commercial paper and municipal notes, which are short-term debt instruments issued by municipalities. U.S. Treasury bills have a maximum maturity of six months (26 weeks), while Treasury notes and bonds have longer maturity dates.\n\nIf a security is sold before thematurity date, the rate of return earned by the investor is different, and the new rate of return is based on the sale price of the security. If, for example, the $1,000 corporate bond purchased for $920 is sold for $1,100 five years after the purchase date, the investor has a gain on the sale. The investor must determine the amount of the bond discount that is posted to income before the sale and must compare that with the $1,100 sale price to calculate the gain.\n\nAzero-coupon bondis a another example of a discount bond. Depending on the length of time until maturity, zero-coupon bonds can be issued at substantial\u00a0discounts to par, sometimes 20% or more. Because a bond will always pay its full, face value, at maturity\u2014assuming no credit events occur\u2014zero-coupon bonds will steadily rise in price as the maturity date approaches. These bonds don't make periodic interest payments and will only make one payment of the face value to the holder at maturity.\n\nAssume, for example, that an investor purchases a $10,000 Treasury bill at a $300 discount from par value (a price of $9,700), and that the security matures in 120 days. In this case, the discount yield is ($300 discount)[/$10,000 par value] * 360/120 days to maturity, or a 9% dividend yield.\n\nSecurities that are sold at a discountuse the discount yield to calculate the investor's rate of return, and this method is different thanbond accretion. Bonds that use bond accretion can be issued a par value, at a discount or a premium, and accretion is used to move the discount amount into bond income over the remaining life of the bond.\n\nAssume, for example, that an investor purchases a $1,000 corporate bond for $920, and the bond matures in 10 years. Since the investor receives $1,000 at maturity, the $80 discount is bond income to the owner, along with interest earned on the bond. Bond accretion means that the $80 discount is posted to bond income over the 10-year life, and an investor can use a straight-line method or the effective interest rate method. Straight-line posts the same dollar amount into bond income each year, and the effective interest rate method uses a more complex formula to calculate the bond income amount.",
