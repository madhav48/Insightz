  "term": "What Is Form 6251: Alternative Minimum Tax-Individuals?",
  "definition": "Form 6251: Alternative Minimum Tax-Individuals is anInternal Revenue Service(IRS) tax form used to determine the amount ofalternative minimum tax(AMT) that a taxpayer may owe.\n\nSome taxpayers with higher incomes can claim certain deductions that allow them to reduce their regular tax obligations. The AMT\u00a0sets an upper limit on how much that deduction can be as a way of ensuring that wealthier individuals pay an adequate amount of taxes. If you are among those to whom it applies, you'll pay the AMT instead of standard income taxes.\n\nEach taxpayer must evaluate whether or not they must pay AMT each year. Depending on your income level,you may not need to.\n\nThe AMT is a tax system parallel to the regular income tax. It was enacted in 1969 and was originally designed to identify and collect taxes owed by a limited number of wealthy individuals and families who were otherwise avoiding income taxes.\n\nIt does this by limiting the number ofitemized deductionsthat can be claimed by a taxpayer. Deductions for state and local taxes are not allowed, for example. In addition, taxpayers impacted by the AMT cannot take thestandard deduction.\n\nThe AMT has two rates (26% and 28%) versus the seven federal tax brackets, which range from 10% to 37%.\n\nThe AMT only applies to taxpayers who have certain types of income that receive favorable tax treatment, or who take certain deductions.\n\nForm 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return includes a worksheet that allows a taxpayer to determine whether AMT is owed, but it only provides basic computations.Form 6251 is more detailed and will give a more accurate answer. Alternatively, you can use tax software or enlist a tax pro.\n\nCertain other tax forms also have an AMT version as well. For example, in addition to Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit, there is also AMT Form 1116, Foreign Tax Credit. If you complete an AMT version of another form, do not attach it to your tax return unless you are instructed to do so.\n\nThe AMT requires affected taxpayers to calculate their tax bill under theordinary income taxsystem and again under the AMT, paying the higher of the two amounts. After calculating your AMT, you can claim anexemptionbased on your filing status.\n\nThe AMT exemption is much higher than the standard exemption but phases out when you reach a certain income level. In 2024, the AMT exemption for individual filers is $85,700 (rising to $88,100 in 2025), and $133,300 for married joint filers (rising to $137,000 in 2025). In 2024 exemption begins to phase out when income reaches $578,150 for individual filers and $1,156,300 for married joint filers. In 2025, the phase-out amounts will be $626,350 (individual) and $1,252,700 (married filing jointly.)\n\nAll pages of Form 6251 are available on theIRS website.\n\nA lack ofinflationadjustments caused the AMT to apply to a much larger group of taxpayers than originally intended. Congress had passed annual inflation adjustments to limit the reach of the AMT before instituting a permanent fix of indexing future exemption levels to inflation as part of theAmerican Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\n\nThe AMT collected $4.7 billion in 2019, about 0.3% of individual income tax revenue but significantly less than the $36.2 billion collected in 2017. This decrease was mainly due to changes to the AMT that were part of theTax Cuts and Jobs Act(TCJA) of 2017. Starting in 2018, for example, TCJA triggered a higher AMT exemption and the level at which the exemption begins to phase out.\n\nThe alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a separate tax that is imposed in addition to your regular federal income tax. It applies to taxpayers who take certain deductions or have certain types of income and is designed to ensure that all taxpayers pay a fair share of taxes. The AMT is calculated using IRS Form 6251.\n\nAny taxpayer whose income is above the AMT exemption rate may be subject to the alternative minimum tax when they file a tax return. The exemption thresholds in 2024 are $85,700 for single filers and $133,300 for married joint filers. In 2025, these amounts rise to $88,100 and $137,000 in 2025.\n\nAccording to the Tax Policy Center, just 0.1% of households in the United States were affected by the alternative minimum tax in 2022. This low percentage is primarily due to the effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), passed in 2017, which shields the majority of high-income households from having to pay the AMT. If this provision of the TCJA is not renewed in 2025, the number of households that pay the AMT is estimated to rise to 4.1%.\n\nThe alternative minimum tax (AMT) is a parallel tax system that is designed to ensure that high earners pay a fair share of taxes. Taxpayers use IRS Form 6251 to determine whether they owe alternative minimum tax or standard income tax.\n\nThe IRS sets income thresholds for the AMT exemption and phase-out levels. These are adjusted each year for inflation. Other changes to the AMT include those made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which reduced how many taxpayers are required to pay it.\n\nU.S. Government of Accountability Office. \"Alternative Minimum Tax: An Overview of Its Rationale and Impact on Individual Taxpayers,\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 6251,\" Page 2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 6251 Alternative Minimum Tax\u2014Individuals,\" Page 9,12.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 6251,\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 1040.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"H.R.8 - American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012.\"\n\nTax Policy Center. \"How Much Revenue Does the AMT Raise?\"\n\nTax Policy Center. \"Who Pays the AMT?\"",
