  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nMass customization is the process of delivering market goods and services that are modified to satisfy a specific customer\u2019s needs.\n\nMass customization is a marketing and manufacturing technique that combines the flexibility and personalization of custom-made products with the lowunit costsassociated withmass production. Other names for mass customization include made-to-order or built-to-order.\n\nMass customization allows a customer to design certainmade-to-orderfeatures of a product while still keeping costs closer to that of mass-produced products. In some cases, the components of the product are modular. This flexibility allows the client to mix and match options to create a semi-custom final product.\n\nMass customization may apply to many fields, but many connect it to theretail industry. Software creators may use this method to include software-based product configurations that enable end-users to add or change specific functions of a core product. Even the financial services industry embraces mass customization through the growth of independent, fee-only advisory firms.\n\nB. Joseph Pine II looked at the growth of theAmerican economydue to mass production. In his book \u201cMass Customization: The New Frontier in Business Competition\u201d (Harvard Business Review Press, 1992), he describes four primary types of mass customization that took the concept of mass production to a new level:\n\nPine focused on the concept of creating a small number of interchangeable pieces. The individual parts may be combined in a variety of ways that produce acost-efficient production modeland still allow consumers to choose how the pieces go together.\n\nFee-only, independentfinancial advisorsallow their clients to customize theirportfolioholdings to match their unique situations. The consumer may choose products that match their investment risk tolerance, time horizon, investment style, and future goals.\n\nCertain furniture companies offer mass customization by providing multiple options for various components or features. This flexibility may include different fabrics, furniture legs, or pieces that combine in numerous configurations. Also, modular home builders use mass customization models by allowing customers to make changes to the base home package.\n\nMass customization enables manufacturers to delay the step ofproduct differentiationuntil the final phase of manufacturing. Rather than the manufacturer deciding on the features that make the product unique, mass customization allows the consumer to make these decisions. For some consumers, the ability to customize a product is enough to sway their buying decision in favor of one company over another.\n\nMass customization can then become part of a lucrativemarketing strategyfor a company. Companies that offer customization can give themselves acompetitive advantageover their rivals. They can tout their ability to produce a semi-custom product at a reasonable price to consumers who are looking for an upgrade over a generic product. As long as the company is able to deliver a product that does not compromise on quality, they have an opportunity to increase sales, profits, andbrand loyaltyfor their one-of-a-kind products.\n\nMass customization can also help a company with the costs associated with excessinventory. Implementing ajust-in-time (JIT)approach to manufacturing can assist companies in minimizing inventory and increasing efficiency. Companies that take a JIT approach to mass customization will need reliable suppliers and an inventory replenishment system that notifies them exactly when new materials need to be ordered.\n\nA customer designs certain made-to-order features of a product but keeps costs closer to that of mass-produced products. With mass customization, the client can mix and match options to create a semi-custom final product.\n\nIndustries that use mass customization include:\n\nManufacturers can delay product differentiation until the finalmanufacturingphase. Also, the customer can decide on the features that make the product unique, which may sway their buying decision. As a result, a company can use mass customization as amarketingstrategy.\n\nMass customization lets a customer personalize certain features of a product while still keeping costs at or near mass production prices. The process is also known as made-to-order or built-to-order.",
