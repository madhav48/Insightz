  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAmanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nThe Macaulay duration is the weighted average term to maturity of the cash flow from a bond, or the point at which the bond's value will equal its purchase price.\n\nThe Macaulay duration is a formula that tells an investor the time it will take for a bond to reach profitability. It measures theweighted averageterm to maturityof the cash flows from the bond.\n\nThe weight of each cash flow is determined by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the price.\n\nMacaulay duration is often used byportfolio managerswho use an immunization strategy. That is, they build a portfolio that is shielded from adverse changes in interest rates.\n\nMacaulay duration can be viewed as the economic balance point of a group of cash flows. It is theweightedaverage number of years that aninvestormust keep the bond until the present value of the bond\u2019s cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond.\n\nThe metric is named after its creator, Canadian economist Frederick Macaulay.\n\nMacaulay duration can be calculated as follows:\n\nMacaulay\u00a0Duration=\u2211t=1nt\u00d7C(1+y)t+n\u00d7M(1+y)nCurrent\u00a0Bond\u00a0Pricewhere:t=Respective\u00a0time\u00a0periodC=Periodic\u00a0coupon\u00a0paymenty=Periodic\u00a0yieldn=Total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0periodsM=Maturity\u00a0value\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Macaulay Duration} = \\frac{ \\sum_{t = 1} ^ {n} \\frac{ t \\times C }{ (1 + y) ^ t } + \\frac{ n \\times M }{ (1 + y) ^ n } }{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&t = \\text{Respective time period} \\\\&C = \\text{Periodic coupon payment} \\\\&y = \\text{Periodic yield} \\\\&n = \\text{Total number of periods} \\\\&M = \\text{Maturity value} \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bMacaulay\u00a0Duration=Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price\u2211t=1n\u200b(1+y)tt\u00d7C\u200b+(1+y)nn\u00d7M\u200b\u200bwhere:t=Respective\u00a0time\u00a0periodC=Periodic\u00a0coupon\u00a0paymenty=Periodic\u00a0yieldn=Total\u00a0number\u00a0of\u00a0periodsM=Maturity\u00a0value\u200b\n\nA bond\u2019s price, maturity, coupon, andyield to maturityall factor into the calculation of duration. All else being equal, duration increases as time to maturity increases. As a bond\u2019s coupon increases, its duration decreases. As interest rates increase, duration decreases and the bond\u2019s sensitivity to further interest rate increases goes down. Also, asinking fundin place, a scheduled prepayment before maturity, andcall provisionsall lower a bond\u2019s duration.\n\nThecalculation of Macaulay durationis straightforward. Let\u2019s assume that a $1,000\u00a0face-value bond pays a 6% coupon and matures in three years. Interest rates are 6% per annum, with semiannual compounding. The bond pays the coupon twice a year and pays the principal on the final payment. Given this, the following cash flows are expected over the next three years:\n\nPeriod\u00a01:$30Period\u00a02:$30Period\u00a03:$30Period\u00a04:$30Period\u00a05:$30Period\u00a06:$1,030\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5}: \\$30 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6}: \\$1,030 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bPeriod\u00a01:$30Period\u00a02:$30Period\u00a03:$30Period\u00a04:$30Period\u00a05:$30Period\u00a06:$1,030\u200b\n\nWith the periods and the cash flows known, a discount factor must be calculated for each period. This is calculated as 1 \u00f7 (1 + r)n, where r is the interest rate and n is the period number in question. The interest rate, r, compounded semiannually is 6% \u00f7 2 = 3%. Therefore, the discount factors would be:\n\nPeriod\u00a01\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)1=0.9709Period\u00a02\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)2=0.9426Period\u00a03\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)3=0.9151Period\u00a04\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)4=0.8885Period\u00a05\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)5=0.8626Period\u00a06\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)6=0.8375\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 1 = 0.9709 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 2 = 0.9426 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 3 = 0.9151 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 4 = 0.8885 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 5 = 0.8626 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6 Discount Factor}: 1 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 6 = 0.8375 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bPeriod\u00a01\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)1=0.9709Period\u00a02\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)2=0.9426Period\u00a03\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)3=0.9151Period\u00a04\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)4=0.8885Period\u00a05\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)5=0.8626Period\u00a06\u00a0Discount\u00a0Factor:1\u00f7(1+.03)6=0.8375\u200b\n\nNext, multiply the period\u2019s cash flow by the period number and by its corresponding discount factor to find the present value of the cash flow:\n\nPeriod\u00a01:1\u00d7$30\u00d70.9709=$29.13Period\u00a02:2\u00d7$30\u00d70.9426=$56.56Period\u00a03:3\u00d7$30\u00d70.9151=$82.36Period\u00a04:4\u00d7$30\u00d70.8885=$106.62Period\u00a05:5\u00d7$30\u00d70.8626=$129.39Period\u00a06:6\u00d7$1,030\u00d70.8375=$5,175.65\u2211Period=16=$5,579.71=numerator\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Period 1}: 1 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9709 = \\$29.13 \\\\ &\\text{Period 2}: 2 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9426 = \\$56.56 \\\\ &\\text{Period 3}: 3 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.9151 = \\$82.36 \\\\ &\\text{Period 4}: 4 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.8885 = \\$106.62 \\\\ &\\text{Period 5}: 5 \\times \\$30 \\times 0.8626 = \\$129.39 \\\\ &\\text{Period 6}: 6 \\times \\$1,030 \\times 0.8375 = \\$5,175.65 \\\\ &\\sum_{\\text{ Period } = 1} ^ {6} = \\$5,579.71 = \\text{numerator} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bPeriod\u00a01:1\u00d7$30\u00d70.9709=$29.13Period\u00a02:2\u00d7$30\u00d70.9426=$56.56Period\u00a03:3\u00d7$30\u00d70.9151=$82.36Period\u00a04:4\u00d7$30\u00d70.8885=$106.62Period\u00a05:5\u00d7$30\u00d70.8626=$129.39Period\u00a06:6\u00d7$1,030\u00d70.8375=$5,175.65Period=1\u22116\u200b=$5,579.71=numerator\u200b\n\nCurrent\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=\u2211PV\u00a0Cash\u00a0Flows=16Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=30\u00f7(1+.03)1+30\u00f7(1+.03)2Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=+\u22ef+1030\u00f7(1+.03)6Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=$1,000Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=denominator\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Current Bond Price} = \\sum_{\\text{ PV Cash Flows } = 1} ^ {6} \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = 30 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 1 + 30 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 2 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} = } + \\cdots + 1030 \\div ( 1 + .03 ) ^ 6 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = \\$1,000 \\\\ &\\phantom{ \\text{Current Bond Price} } = \\text{denominator} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bCurrent\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=PV\u00a0Cash\u00a0Flows=1\u22116\u200bCurrent\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=30\u00f7(1+.03)1+30\u00f7(1+.03)2Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=+\u22ef+1030\u00f7(1+.03)6Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=$1,000Current\u00a0Bond\u00a0Price=denominator\u200b\n\n(Note that since the coupon rate and the interest rate are the same, the bond will trade at par.)\n\nMacaulay\u00a0Duration=$5,579.71\u00f7$1,000=5.58\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Macaulay Duration} = \\$5,579.71 \\div \\$1,000 = 5.58 \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bMacaulay\u00a0Duration=$5,579.71\u00f7$1,000=5.58\u200b\n\nA coupon-paying bond will always have its duration less than its time to maturity.
