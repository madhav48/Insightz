  "definition": "A home is a physicaldomicileor structure in which a person or household resides. In a legal sense, a home is the place of permanent residency where one lives, or intends to return to live.\n\nWhile it is full of emotional connotations, a home has specific legal connotations, as it is used to determine many things, from tax liability to a person\u2019s status in the country they reside in. It can also be used to determine which state'sprobatelaws are followed, a state\u2019s rights when it comes to collecting taxes, and citizenship when a person resides in a different country than where they were born.\n\nIf a person owns more than one dwelling, like avacation homeor aninvestment property, for example, their primary residence is the location that will be considered their legal home. This legal status will impact how their taxes are paid on that property, as opposed to their responsibility for taxes on their other properties. There are certain write-offs and deductions that can only be used on a person\u2019s primary residence.\n\nThe type of homeowner\u2019s insurance orhazard insurancethat a person carries on their home will also vary based on the type of occupancy. Since a home is an owner-occupied property, certain additional coverages apply\u2014as opposed to a non-owner-occupied property, which may only carry a policy that covers the building and not the contents. The latter would be the case with a property that is occupied by someone other than the owner, like a rental property. A renter may choose to carry their own renter's insurance to protect their belongings within the rented unit, but it is the building's landlord who can carry homeowners insurance (or a commercial version thereof)\u2014which would generally cover only the building and its infrastructure.\n\nAlthough a home may be vacant if a person is traveling for an extended period, or has been hospitalized, the location is still legally considered their home if there is an intention to return and they have not claimed someplace else as their legal place of permanent orprincipal residence.\n\nFor example, imagine Mary Smith owns three properties. The first is a beach house in New Jersey. She uses this property during the summer months with her children; in the wintertime, the property remains empty. This is her vacation home.\n\nHer second property is a condominium in New York City. She rents the condominium out to Kate Jones, who lives there full-time, and pays her $1,500 a month in rent. This is her investment property.\n\nHer third and final property is a two-story house in a suburb just outside of Philadelphia. It is where she lives with her spouse and three children. Her kids go to school within the local district, and she pays her state and local income taxes based on Pennsylvania\u2019s rates. This is her home, or primary residence.\n\nNow consider that Mary\u2019s oldest child is ready to graduate from high school and is applying to colleges. New York state offers free college tuition to residents\u2014that is, people who live in the state of New York. Although Mary owns a condominium in New York, neither she nor her kids call the state home. They will be unable to take advantage of New York\u2019s free college tuition program.\n\nHowever, Kate Jones, her New York condo tenant, is eligible to take advantage of the state\u2019s free tuition. Even though she doesn\u2019t own the property she resides in, it is her legal residence, and she calls New York City, within the state of New York, home.\n\nThe Law Dictionary. \"House Definition & Legal Meaning.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 523, Selling Your Home,\" Page 3.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \"Chapter 6 - Jurisdiction, Place of Residence, and Early Filing.\"\n\nRocket Mortgage. \"Primary Residence: What Is It and Why Is It Important?\"\n\nNew York State Department of Financial Services. \"Homeowners & Tenants Insurance: What Consumers Need to Know.\"",
