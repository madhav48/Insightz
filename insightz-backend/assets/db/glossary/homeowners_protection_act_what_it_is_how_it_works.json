  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 is a\u00a0law designed to reduce the unnecessary payment ofprivate mortgage insurance (PMI)by homeowners who may no longer be required to pay it. The Homeowners Protection Act covers all private, residential mortgages purchased after July 29, 1999. The act, also known as the PMI Cancellation Act, mandates thatlendersdisclose certain information about PMI.\n\nThe law also stipulates that PMI must be automatically terminated for homeowners who accumulate the required amount of equity in their homes (and thus, are no longer required to have purchased PMI).\n\nMost lenders require adown paymentthat is equal to approximately 20% of the home's purchase price. This standard is meant to ensure that\u00a0the borrower has\u00a0enough financial interest in the property to continue making\u00a0payments, and\u2014in the event that the borrower is\u00a0unable to make mortgage payments\u2014that the lender has\u00a0sufficient equity available to cover lender foreclosure costs.\n\nIf a borrower can't\u2014or chooses not to\u2014come up with that amount,\u00a0a lender may decide that the loan is a risky investment, and, as a result, require that the homebuyer take out PMI. In the event that a borrower defaults on their mortgage\u2014and their home goes into foreclosure\u2014the purpose of PMI is to provide extra protection for the lender.\n\nThe Homeowners Protection Act does not apply to Veterans Affairs (VA) or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans.\n\nAn additional reason that a homeowner may be required to purchase PMI coverage is if the mortgage the homeowner seeks has a highloan-to-value (LTV) ratio.\n\nLTV is one of the measures of risk that lenders use inunderwritinga mortgage. LTV divides the amount of the loan by the value of the home. Most mortgages with an LTV ratio greater than 80% require that the borrower have PMI because they are considered more likely todefaulton the mortgage.\n\nWith PMI, homeowners are responsible for purchasing insurance coverage for their mortgage and for paying insurance premiums. These premiums may either be added to the borrower's monthly mortgage payments, or the additional cost may be absorbed by the borrower\u2019s interest rate (resulting in a higher interest rate).\n\nPMI can be removed once a borrower pays down enough of the mortgage's principal (usually when their equity reaches 20%) or when their LTV ratio reaches 80%. However, before the Homeowners Protection Act, many homeowners had\u00a0problems canceling PMI. In some instances, lenders may have agreed to terminate coverage when the borrower\u2019s equity reached 20%, but\u00a0policies for canceling\u00a0PMI coverage varied widely among lenders, and homeowners had limited recourse if\u00a0lenders refused to cancel PMI.\n\nThe Homeowners Protection Act protects homeowners by prohibiting life-of-loan PMI coverage for borrower-paid PMI products and establishing uniform procedures for canceling\u00a0PMI coverage.\u00a0The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) supervises and enforces compliance with the Homeowners Protection Act.",
