  "term": "Durbin Watson Test: What It Is in Statistics, With Examples",
  "definition": "The Durbin Watson (DW) statistic is a test forautocorrelationin the residuals from a statistical model orregression analysis. The Durbin-Watson statistic will always have a value ranging between 0 and 4. A value of 2.0 indicates there is no autocorrelation detected in the sample. Values from 0 to less than 2 point to positive autocorrelation, and values from 2 to 4 mean negative autocorrelation.\n\nA stock price displaying positive autocorrelation would indicate that the price yesterday has a positive correlation on the price today\u2014so if the stock fell yesterday, it is also likely that it falls today. A security that has a negative autocorrelation, on the other hand, has a negative influence on itself over time\u2014so if it fell yesterday, there is a greater likelihood it will rise today.\n\nAutocorrelation, also known asserial correlation, can be a significant problem in analyzing historical data if one does not know to look out for it. For instance, since stock prices tend not to change too radically from one day to another, the prices from one day to the next could potentially be highly correlated, even though there is little useful information in this observation. To avoid autocorrelation issues, the easiest solution in finance is to simply convert a series of historical prices into a series of percentage-price changes from day to day.\n\nAutocorrelation can be useful fortechnical analysis, which is most concerned with the trends of, and relationships between, security prices using charting techniques in lieu of a company\u2019s financial health or management. Technical analysts can use autocorrelation to see how much of an impact past prices for a security have on its future price.\n\nAutocorrelation can show if there is a momentum factor associated with a stock. For example, if you know that a stock historically has a high positive autocorrelation value and you witnessed the stock making solid gains over the past several days, then you might reasonably expect the movements over the upcoming several days (the leading time series) to match those of the lagging time series and to move upward.\n\nThe Durbin Watson statistic is named after statisticians James Durbin and Geoffrey Watson.\n\nA rule of thumb is that DW test statistic values in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 are relatively normal. Values outside this range could, however, be a cause for concern. The Durbin Watson statistic is displayed by many regression analysis programs, but is not applicable in certain situations.\n\nFor instance, when lagged dependent variables are included in the explanatory variables, then it is inappropriate to use this test.\n\nThe formula for the Durbin Watson statistic is rather complex but involves the residuals from an ordinaryleast squares (OLS) regressionon a set of data. The following example illustrates how to calculate this statistic.\n\nAssume the following (x,y) data points:\n\nPair\u00a0One=(10and1100)Pair\u00a0Two=(20and1200)Pair\u00a0Three=(35and985)Pair\u00a0Four=(40and750)Pair\u00a0Five=(50and1215)Pair\u00a0Six=(45and1000)\\begin{aligned}&\\text{Pair One}=(10\\text{ and }1100)\\\\&\\text{Pair Two}=(20\\text{ and }1200)\\\\&\\text{Pair Three}=(35 \\text{ and }985)\\\\&\\text{Pair Four}=(40\\text{ and }750)\\\\&\\text{Pair Five}=(50\\text{ and }1215)\\\\&\\text{Pair Six}=(45 \\text{ and }1000)\\end{aligned}\u200bPair\u00a0One=(10and1100)Pair\u00a0Two=(20and1200)Pair\u00a0Three=(35and985)Pair\u00a0Four=(40and750)Pair\u00a0Five=(50and1215)Pair\u00a0Six=(45and1000)\u200b\n\nUsing the methods of a least squares regression to find the \u201cline of best fit,\u201d the equation for the best fit line of this data is:\n\nY=\u22122.6268x+1,129.2Y={-2.6268}x+{1,129.2}Y=\u22122.6268x+1,129.2\n\nThis first step in calculating the Durbin Watson statistic is to calculate the expected \u201cy\u201d values using the line of best fit equation.
