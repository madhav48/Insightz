  "term": "Economic Life: Definition, Determining Factors, Vs. Depreciation",
  "definition": "Economic life is the expected period of time during which an asset remains\u00a0useful to the average owner. When an assetdepreciates to the pointit is no longer useful to its owner, then it is said to be past its economic life. The economic life of an asset could be different than its actual physical life. Thus, an asset can be in optimal physical condition but may not be economically useful. For example, technology products often become obsolete when their technology becomes obsolete. The obsolescence of flip phones occurred due to the advent of smartphones and not because they ran out of utility.\n\nEstimating the economic life of an asset is important for businesses so that they can determine when it's worthwhile to invest in new equipment,\u00a0allocating appropriate funds to purchase replacements once the equipment'suseful lifeis\u00a0met.\n\nThe economic\u00a0life of an asset under theGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP) requires a reasonable estimate of the time involved. Businesses can shift their measurements based on the anticipated daily usage and other factors. The concept of economic life is also connected to depreciation schedules. Accounting standard setting\u00a0bodies usually set generally accepted guidelines for estimating and adjusting this time period.\n\nFinancial considerations regarding the economic life of an asset include the cost at the time of purchase, the amount of time the asset can be used in production, the time at which it will need to be replaced, and the cost of maintenance or replacement. Changes in industry standards or regulations may also be involved.\n\nNew regulations may render current equipment obsolete or raise the required industry standards for an asset beyond the specifications of a business's existing assets. Further, the economic life on one asset may be tied to the useful life of another. In cases where two separate assets are required to complete a task, the loss of one asset may render the second asset useless until the first asset is repaired or replaced.\n\nDepreciationrefers to the rate at which an asset deteriorates over time. The depreciation rate is used to estimate the effects of aging, daily use, and wear and tear on the asset. When related to technology, depreciation can also include therisk of obsolescence.\n\nIn theory, businesses recognize depreciation expenses on a schedule that approximates the rate at which economic life is used up. This is not always true for tax purposes, however, as owners may have superior information about specific assets. The economic life used in internal calculations may differ significantly from the depreciable life required for tax purposes.\n\nMany businesses evaluate depreciation expenses differently based on management's goals. For example, a business might want to recognize costs as quickly as possible in order to minimize currenttax liabilitiesand may do this by choosingaccelerated depreciationschedules.",
