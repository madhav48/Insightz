  "term": "What Is Quantitative Trading? Definition, Examples, and Profit",
  "definition": "Quantitative trading consists of trading strategies based onquantitative analysis, which rely on mathematical computations and number crunching to identify trading opportunities. Price and volume are two of the more common data inputs used in quantitative analysis as the main inputs to mathematical models.\n\nAs quantitative trading is generally used by financial institutions andhedge funds, the transactions are usually large and may involve the purchase and sale of hundreds of thousands of shares and other securities. However, quantitative trading is becoming more commonly used by individual investors.\n\nQuantitative traders take advantage of modern technology, mathematics, and the availability of comprehensive databases for making rational trading decisions.\n\nQuantitative traders take a trading technique and create a model of it using mathematics, and then they develop a computer program that applies the model to historical market data. The model is then backtested and optimized. If favorable results are achieved, the system is then implemented in real-time markets with real capital.\n\nThe way quantitative trading models function can best be described using an analogy. Consider a weather report in which the meteorologist forecasts a 90% chance of rain while the sun is shining. The meteorologist derives this counterintuitive conclusion by collecting and analyzing climate data from sensors throughout the area.\n\nA computerized quantitative analysis reveals specific patterns in the data. When these patterns are compared to the same patterns revealed in historical climate data (backtesting), and 90 out of 100 times the result is rain, then the meteorologist can draw the conclusion with confidence\u2014hence, the 90% forecast. Quantitative traders apply this same process to the financial market to make trading decisions.\n\nHistorical price, volume, and correlation with other assets are some of the more common data inputs used in quantitative analysis as the main inputs to mathematical models.\n\nDepending on the trader's research and preferences, quantitative trading algorithms can be customized to evaluate different parameters related to a stock. Consider the case of a trader who believes in momentum investing. They can choose to write a simple program that picks out the winners during an upward momentum in the markets. During the next market upturn, the program will buy those stocks.\n\nThis is a fairly simple example of quantitative trading. Typically an assortment of parameters, from technical analysis to value stocks to fundamental analysis, is used to pick out a complex mix of stocks designed to maximize profits. These parameters are programmed into a trading system to take advantage of market movements.\n\nQuantitative trading techniques are utilized extensively by certain hedge funds,high-frequency trading(HFT) firms,algorithmic tradingplatforms, andstatistical arbitragedesks. These techniques may involve rapid-fire order execution and typically have short-term investment horizons.\n\nThe objective of trading is to calculate the optimal probability of executing a profitable trade. A typical trader can effectively monitor, analyze and make trading decisions on a limited number of securities before the amount of incoming data overwhelms the decision-making process. The use of quantitative trading techniques illuminates this limit by using computers to automate the monitoring, analyzing, and trading decisions.\n\nOvercoming emotion is one of the most pervasive problems with trading. Be it fear or greed, when trading, emotion serves only to stifle rational thinking, which usually leads to losses. Computers and mathematics do not possess emotions, so quantitative trading eliminates this problem.\n\nQuantitative trading does have its problems. Financial markets are some of the most dynamic entities that exist. Therefore, quantitative trading models must be as dynamic to be consistently successful. Many quantitative traders develop models that are temporarily profitable for the market condition for which they were developed, but they ultimately fail when market conditions change.\n\nBecause they must possess a certain level of mathematical skill, training, and knowledge, quant traders are often in demand on Wall St. Indeed, many quants have advanced degrees in fields like applied statistics, computer science, or mathematical modeling. As a result, successful quants can earn a great deal of money, especially if they are employed by a successful hedge fund or trading firm.\n\nQuantitative traders, or quants for short, use mathematical models and large data sets to identify trading opportunities and buy and sell securities.\n\nAn aspiring quant trader needs to be exceptionally skilled and interested in all things mathematical. A bachelor's degree in math, a master's degree in financial engineering or quantitative financial modeling, or an MBA are all helpful for scoring a job; many analysts will also have a Ph.D. in these or similar fields. In addition to an advanced degree, a quant should also have experience and familiarity with data mining, research methods, statistical analysis, and automated trading systems.\n\nThe primary difference is that algorithmic trading is able to automate trading decisions and executions. While a human can be a quant, computers are much faster and more accurate than even the most dexterous trader. However, the bottom line is that the two are not mutually exclusive. Algorithm trading is normally quantitate trading being done by automated computer algorithms.\n\nBecause quant trading requires a mastery of math, statistics, and programming, it is unlikely to be the case that one can simply read a few books and become adept. Rather, successful quants invest a great deal of time and money in formal education, industry credentialing, and self-study. Additionally, the cost of the trading systems and infrastructure to begin trading as a quant are high and capital-intensive. That said, online courses on the subject do exist. These could be a great way to get an introduction and try out the field before investing further.",
