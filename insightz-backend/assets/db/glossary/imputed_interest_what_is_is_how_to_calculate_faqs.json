  "definition": "Imputed interest is a term used in tax law to describe a situation where a lender charges no interest on a loan, but the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers the loan to have been made at an interest rate that is \"imputed\" or implied by market conditions. This can happen when a lender charges a lower interest rate than the market rate, or when a borrower receives a loan from a family member or friend at a below-market interest rate. In such cases, the IRS may require the lender to pay taxes on the difference between the actual interest rate and the imputed interest rate.\n\nThe IRS thus uses imputed interest to collect\u00a0tax revenues on loans or securities that pay little or no interest. Imputed interest is important for discount bonds, such as zero-coupon bonds\u00a0and other securities sold below face value and matureat par. The IRS uses anaccretivemethod when calculating the imputed interest on Treasury bonds and hasapplicable federal ratesthat seta minimum interest ratein relation to imputed interest and original issue discount rules.\n\nImputed interest occurs when a taxpayer has borrowed money but the lender charges no interest or an interest rate that is much lower than the market rate. The tax treatment of such loans depends on whether the loan was an actual loan, a demand loan, or a gift from friends or family. This distinction is important because the tax authorities treat each type of loan differently with respect to imputed interest.\n\nThe IRS considers an actual loan to occur when there is a written agreement between the lender and borrower. In this case, the lender may be required to pay taxes on interest income, whether or not they actually charged a market interest rate. Submission of written records helps the IRS determine whether the loan is a conventional loan, as opposed to a gift loan.\n\nImputed interest may therefore apply to loans among family and friends. For example, a mother loans her son $50,000 with no interest charges. If the applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, the son should pay his mother $1,000 annually in interest. The IRS\u00a0assumes the mother collects this amount from her son and lists it on her tax return as interest income\u00a0even though she did not collect the funds.\n\nGift loans of less than $10,000 are exempt from imputed interest, as long as the money isn't used to buy income-producing assets.\n\nBecause there were many low-interest or interest-free loans that went untaxed, the IRS established applicable federal rates through the Tax Act of 1984. The applicable federal rate (AFR) determines the lowest interest that one may charge\u00a0on loans below a specific interest rate threshold and considers the amount of potential income generated from the interest rate as imputed income. Because of the creation of AFR, the IRS may collect tax revenue from loans that are otherwise untaxed.\n\nBecause imputed tax rates are tied to the actual interest rate environment at a given time, each month, the IRS provides various prescribed rates for federal income tax purposes. AFR rates are regularly published as revenue rulings and can be looked up on the IRS website.\n\nWhen calculating imputed interest on azero-coupon bond, an investor first determines the bond\u2019syield to maturity(YTM). Assuming the accrual period is one year, the investor divides the face value of the bond by the price paid when it was\u00a0purchased.\u00a0The investor\u00a0then increases the value by a power equal to one divided by the number of accrual periods before the bond matures. The investor reduces the number by one and multiplies by the number of accrual periods in one year to determine the zero-coupon bond\u2019s YTM.\n\nBecause the adjusted purchase price of a zero-coupon bond is initially equal to its purchase price when issued, the accrued interest gained over each accrual period adds to the adjusted purchase price. The accrued interest is the initial adjusted purchase price multiplied by the YTM. This value is the imputed interest for the period.\n\nWhile the concept of interest and the charging of interest on loans is a common practice in the financial world, the idea of imputed interest is a legal construct that is used to determine whether a lender is required to pay taxes on a loan that has been made at a below-market interest rate. Imputed interest is, therefore, not an actual interest rate or a real cost to the borrower, but rather a theoretical interest rate that is used for tax purposes.\n\nThere are several exemptions to the rules on imputed interest, which may allow a lender to avoid paying taxes on the difference between the actual and imputed interest rates. For example, a loan between family members may be exempt from imputed interest if the loan is for a reasonable amount (typically less than $10,000) and is charged at a rate that is not significantly below the market rate, and if the loan is not used to purchase income-generating assets. Additionally, loans made by a qualified charitable organization, a political organization, or a nonprofit organization may also be exempt from imputed interest.\n\nLoans made for the purpose of buying a primary residence may be exempt from imputed interest, as may loans made for the purpose of buying a car or other certain other personal property. Additionally, loans made for the purpose of funding a business or investment may also be exempt from imputed interest in some cases.\n\nIt's important to note that the rules and exemptions for imputed interest can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the loan and the applicable tax laws. It's always best to consult with a tax professional if you have questions about imputed interest and how it may apply to you.\n\nAzero-coupon bondis a type of bond that does not pay periodic interest payments to the bondholder. Instead, the bond issold at a discountfrom its face value, and the difference between the purchase price and the face value is considered to be the return on the investment. In the case of a zero-coupon bond, the imputed interest is the difference between the purchase price of the bond and the face value. For example, if a zero-coupon bond has aface valueof $1,000 and is purchased for $700, the imputed interest would be $300.\n\nThe bondholder would be required to pay taxes on this imputed interest each year, even though they did not receive any actual interest payments.\n\nImputed interest is important for determining pension payouts. For example, when an employee retires from a company where they\u00a0were a member of a pension plan, the company may offer the retiree a lump sum of the $500,000 set aside for them under the plan, or they may receive $5,000 a year in benefits. Assuming the applicable short-term federal rate is 2 percent, the retiree needs to determine whether they could find\u00a0better imputed interest in another market by taking the lump sum and purchasing a\u00a0higher-yield annuity.\n\nIn most cases, imputed interest is not tax-deductible. This means that if you are required to pay taxes on the imputed interest on a loan, you cannot claim a deduction for that interest on your tax return. However, there are some exceptions to this rule. For example, if you use the loan proceeds to buy a primary residence or to fund a business or investment, you may be able to claim a deduction for the imputed interest on your taxes. Additionally, if you are a qualified charitable organization, a political organization, or a nonprofit organization, you may be exempt from the rules on imputed interest and may be able to claim a deduction for the interest you pay on your loans. It's always best to consult with a tax professional if you have questions about whether you can claim a deduction for imputed interest on your taxes.\n\nIn most cases, the lender is responsible for paying taxes on the imputed interest on a loan. This means that if the IRS determines that a loan should have been made at a higher interest rate than the actual rate charged by the lender, the lender may be required to pay taxes on the difference between the two rates and is responsible for reporting the imputed interest on their tax return. In some cases, the borrower may also be required to report the imputed interest and pay taxes on it, depending on the specific circumstances of the loan.\n\nThe calculation of imputed interest can vary depending on the specific circumstances of the loan and the applicable tax laws. In general, however, the imputed interest on a loan is the difference between the actual interest rate charged by the lender and the market interest rate for a similar loan. This difference is then multiplied by the loan principal to determine the amount of imputed interest.\n\nFor example, if a borrower receives a loan of $10,000 at an interest rate of 3%, and the market interest rate for a similar loan is actually 4%, the imputed interest would be $100 (1% x $10,000).\n\nImputed interest is a term used in tax law to describe a situation where a lender charges no interest on a loan, but the IRS considers the loan to have been made at an interest rate that is implied by market conditions. In such cases, the lender may be required to pay taxes on the difference between the actual and imputed interest rates. There are several exemptions to these rules, including loans made for the purpose of buying a primary residence or funding a business or investment. The calculation of imputed interest is generally based on the difference between the actual interest rate and the market interest rate for a similar loan.\n\nCorrection\u2014May 14, 2023:An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it is the lender's responsibility to pay interest on a loan. In most cases, lenders are responsible for paying taxes on the imputed interest of a loan.\n\nTurboTax. \"IRS Tax Rules for Imputed Interest.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Applicable Federal Rates (AFRs) Rulings.\"\n\nIntuit. \"IRS Tax Rules for Imputed Income.\"",
