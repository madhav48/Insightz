  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations.\n\nA vocational degree is an academic certificate awarded to students who have completed the degree requirements for a specific trade or career. Vocational degrees are popular because they typically require less time to complete than atraditional degree program(e.g., associate or bachelor's degree), and upon completion, the student is often ready to begin working the trade.A collegeundergraduate degreefocuses on developing an individual's all-around intelligence and critical-thinking skills, but may not prepare an individual for a specific job. However, vocational degrees offer training for careers, such as medical coding and billing, auto mechanics, cosmetology, electrical work, and legal secretary work.\n\nSometimes it is possible to get abachelor's degreein a program that is also offered as a vocational degree, but not all vocational degrees can be obtained through a traditional four-year college. For example, it is possible to become a paralegal after obtaining a law degree at a university or after completing a paralegal vocational degree; however, few, if any, colleges offer bachelor's degrees in cosmetology.\n\nThe parameters for what qualifies as a vocational degree may vary by state. Two years of nursing education in California, for instance,\u00a0is quantified as a vocational or technical degree, but in other states, that same curriculum might be recorded as non-vocational.The length of the curriculum for vocational degrees can vary drastically from a couple of months to two years.\n\nThe value of vocational degrees can also vary, with some estimates showing that shorter-term programs can offer higher career returns on the investment. The range of salaries for jobs open to those with vocational degrees can vary widely.\n\nVocational degrees are sometimes sought by individuals who have already established a career in one field but are looking to be trained in supplemental areas. This sort of activity may be common in industries that have undergone evolutionary periods when new required skill sets are needed to remain employed in a particular role. For instance, many careers now require an understanding and use of information technology and computer programming skills as a part of daily work.\n\nVocational degrees may also be used for job-changers who seek a fresh, more competitive position in thejob marketon an entirely different career path. They might even have college degrees in specialized fields. A vocational degree is an opportunity to pursue work that might not otherwise be available to them. This can be especially true if certain industry positions see a sudden rise in immediate demand with few professionals available to fill the roles. Pursuing a vocational degree that offers such skills may be an opportunity to achieve a higher salary in a short amount of time.\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"Choosing a Vocational School or Certificate Program.\"\n\nCalifornia Board of Vocational Nursing and Psychiatric Technicians. \"Licensed Vocational Nurses (LVNs).\"",
