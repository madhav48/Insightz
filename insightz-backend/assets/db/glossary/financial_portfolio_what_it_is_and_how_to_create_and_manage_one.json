  "term": "Financial Portfolio: What It Is and How to Create and Manage One",
  "definition": "A financial portfolio is a basket made up of positions in various investments that work together to serve an investor\u2019s goals.\n\nA portfolio is a collection of financial investments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, cash, and cash equivalents including closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nPeople generally believe that stocks, bonds, and cash create the core of a portfolio. This is often the case but it doesn't have to be the rule. A portfolio can contain a wide range of assets including real estate, art, and private investments.\n\nYou might choose to hold and manage your portfolio yourself or you may allow a money manager, financial advisor, or another finance professional to manage your portfolio for you.\n\nOne of the key concepts inportfolio managementis the wisdom ofdiversification: not putting all your eggs in one basket.Diversification tries to reduceriskby allocating investments among various financial instruments, industries, and other categories. It aims to maximize returns\u00a0by investing in different areas that would each react differently to the same event.\n\nThere are many ways to diversify. How you choose to do it is up to you. Your goals for the future, your appetite for risk, and your personality are all key factors in deciding how to build your portfolio.\n\nAll portfolios should contain some degree of diversification, regardless of your portfolio\u2019s asset mix. They should reflect the investor\u2019s tolerance for risk,returnobjectives,time horizon, and other pertinent constraints. These can include tax position,liquidityneeds, legal situations, and unique circumstances.\n\n\"Portfolio\u201d comes from the Latin wordfolium.It means to \u201ccarry leaves\u201d as in papers. Stock and bond certificates were once issued only in paper form.\n\nThink of an investment portfolio as a pie that's been divided into pieces of varying wedge-shaped sizes, each piece representing a different asset class and type of investment.\n\nInvestors aim to construct a well-diversified portfolio to achieve arisk-return portfolio allocationthat's appropriate for their level of risk tolerance.Stocks, bonds, and cash are generally viewed as a portfolio\u2019s core building blocks but you can grow a portfolio with many types of assets including real estate,gold stocks, various types of bonds, paintings, and other artcollectibles.\n\nThis sample portfolio allocation is for aninvestorwith a low tolerance for risk. A conservative strategy generally tries to protect a portfolio\u2019s value by investing in lower-risk securities. You\u2019ll see in this example that a full 50% is allocated tobondsthat might contain high-grade corporates and government bonds includingmunicipals (munis).\n\nThe 20% stock allocation could be made up of blue-chip or large-cap equities and 30% ofshort-term investmentsmight include cash, certificates of deposit (CDs), and high-yield savings accounts.\n\nMost investment professionals agree that diversification is a key component for reaching long-range financial goals while minimizing risk although it doesn't guarantee against loss.\n\nThere can be as manytypes of portfoliosand portfolio strategies as there are investors and money managers. You might also choose to have multiple portfolios whose contents could reflect a different strategy or investment scenario structured for a different need.\n\nThe hybrid portfolio approach diversifies acrossasset classes. Building a hybrid portfolio requires taking positions in stocks as well as bonds, commodities, real estate, and even art. A hybrid portfolio generally entails relatively fixed proportions of stocks, bonds, and alternative investments. This is beneficial because stocks, bonds, and alternatives have historically exhibited less-than-perfect correlations with one another.\n\nYou expect that the stock, bond, or another financial asset will earn a return, grow in value over time, or both when you use a portfolio for investment purposes. A portfolio investment may be eitherstrategicwhere you buy financial assets with the intention of holding onto those assets for a long time or tactical where you actively buy and sell the asset hoping to achieve short-term gains.\n\nThe underlying assets in an aggressive portfolio generally assume great risks in search of great returns. Aggressive investors seek companies that are in the early stages of their growth\u00a0and have a uniquevalue proposition. Most of them aren't yet common household names.\n\nA defensive portfolio would tend to focus on consumer staples that are impervious to downturns. Defensive stocks do well in bad times as well as in good times. Companies that make products that are essential to everyday life will survive no matter how bad the economy is at a given time.\n\nThis type of portfolio makes money from dividend-paying stocks or other types of distributions to stakeholders. Some of the stocks in the income portfolio could also fit in the defensive portfolio but they're selected primarily for their highyieldsin this case. An income portfolio should generate positive cash flow.Real estate investment trusts (REITs)are an example of an income-producing investment.\n\nA speculative portfolio is best for investors who have a high tolerance for risk. Speculative plays could includeinitial public offerings (IPOs)orstocksthat are rumored to be takeover targets. Technology or healthcare firms\u00a0in the process of developing a single breakthrough product would also fall into this category.\n\nA financial advisor can create a generic portfolio model for an individual but an investor\u2019s risk tolerance should significantly reflect the portfolio\u2019s content.\n\nInvestors should also consider how long they have to invest when they're building a portfolio. Investors should generally move toward a conservative asset allocation as their goal date approaches to protect the portfolio\u2019s earnings up to that point. A conservative investor might favor a portfolio with large-cap value stocks, broad-based market index funds, investment-grade bonds, and a position in liquid, high-grade cash equivalents.\n\nTake an investor who's saving for retirement and plans to leave the workforce in five years. They might want to invest a larger portion of the portfolio in more conservative assets such as bonds and cash to help protect what has already been saved even if they're comfortable investing in stocks and riskier securities.\n\nAn individual who's just entering the workforce might want to invest their\u00a0entire portfolio in stocks because they\u00a0have decades to invest and the ability to ride out some of the market\u2019s short-termvolatility.\n\nBuilding an investment portfolio requires more effort than the passive, index-investing approach. You must first identify yourgoals, risk tolerance, and time horizon then research and select stocks or other investments that fit within those parameters. Regular monitoring and updating are often required along with entry and exit points for each position.\n\nRebalancing requires selling some holdings and buying more of others so your portfolio\u2019s asset allocation matches your strategy, risk tolerance, and desired level of returns most of the time.\n\nDefining and building a portfolio can increase your investing confidence and give you control over your finances despite the extra effort required.\n\nA good portfolio will depend on your investment style, goals, risk tolerance, and time horizon. A good degree of diversification is generally recommended regardless of the portfolio type so you're not holding all your eggs in one basket.\n\nA portfolio\u2019s standard deviation of returns orvarianceis often used as a proxy of overall portfolio risk. The standard deviation calculation isn't merely a weighted average of the individual assets\u2019 standard deviations. It must also account for theco-varianceamong the different holdings.\n\nThe standard deviation calculation for a two-asset portfolio is:\n\n\u03c3p= (w12\u03c312+ w22\u03c322+ 2w1w2Cov1,2)1/2\n\nA portfolio is the cornerstone of investing in the markets. It's composed of the various positions in stocks, bonds, and other assets held and is viewed as one cohesive unit. The portfolio components must therefore work together to serve the investor\u2019s financial goals, constrained by their risk tolerance and time horizon.\n\nPortfolios can be constructed to achieve various strategies, from index replication to income generation to capital preservation. Diversification is seen as a good way to reduce risk regardless of the strategy without sacrificing the portfolio\u2019s expected return.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
