  "term": "Application Programming Interface (API): Definition and Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn application programming interface (API) is a set of programming codes that queries data, parse responses, and sends instructions between one software platform and another. APIs are used extensively in providing data services across a range of fields and contexts.\n\nAPIs have become increasingly popular tools, with the likes of Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, SalesForce, and many more establishing their own APIs that allow companies to access some of their services without having to fully migrate into their ecosystem. This new paradigm has led to the rise of what some experts call the \"API economy,\" a model that enhances a company\u2019sbottom lineby improving interoperability and thus creating new systems from existing ones.\n\nIn the domain of financial markets and trading, one may use an API to establish a connection between a set of automated tradingalgorithmsand the trader's preferred trading broker platform for the purpose of obtaining real-time quotes and\u00a0pricing data or to place electronic trades.\n\nAPIs have become increasingly popular with the rise of automatedtrading systems. In the past,retail traderswere forced toscreenfor opportunities in one application and separately\u00a0place trades with their broker. Many retail brokers now provide APIs that enable traders to directly connect their screening software with thebrokerage accountto share real-time prices and place orders. Traders can even develop their own applications using programming languages like Python and execute trades using a broker's\u00a0API.\n\nTwo types of traders use broker APIs:\n\nDespite the apparent benefits of APIs, there are many risks to consider. Most APIs are provided to a broker's customers free of charge, but there are some cases where traders may incur an extra fee. It's important to understand these fees before using the API.\n\nTraders should also be aware of any API limitations, including the potential for downtime, which could significantly affect trading results.\n\nThe most popular brokers supporting API access in the traditional stock andfutures marketsinclude TradeStation, TDAmeritrade, and InteractiveBrokers, but many smaller brokers have expanded access over time. APIs are more common amongforex brokerswhere third-party applications and trading systems\u2014such as MetaTrader\u2014have been commonly used for many years.\n\nMany brokers provide online documentation for their APIs. Developers can find out exactly how to authenticate with the API, what data is available for consumption, how to place orders through the API, and other technical details. It's essential to be familiar\u00a0with these details before choosing a broker when\u00a0looking for specific functionality.\n\nSome brokers also provide libraries in various languages to make interaction\u00a0with their API easier. For example, a broker may offer a Python library that provides a set of functions, or methods, for placing a trade rather than having to write your own functions to do so. This can help accelerate the development of trading systems and make them less costly to develop.",
