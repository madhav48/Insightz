As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nCost-push inflation is a form of inflation caused by an increase in the cost of production inputs, such as raw materials and wagers, that leads to an increase in prices.\n\nCost-push inflation happens when businesses raise the price of goods and services because the cost of producing them increases. Let's say you run a lemonade stand. The cost of the lemons, sugar, and water you need to make your lemonade goes up from last month. To continue making a profit, you need to pass that increase off to your customers. That's known as cost-push inflation. Cost-push inflation can also be influenced by higher wages, taxes, and supply-chain issues, or when higher costs decrease the aggregate supply in the economy.\n\nInflationis a measure of the rate of price increases in an economy for a basket of selected goods and services.\u00a0Inflation can erode a consumer\u2019s purchasing power if wages haven\u2019t increased enough or kept up with rising prices. If a company\u2019s production costs rise, the company\u2019s executive management might try to pass the additional costs on to consumers by raising the prices for their products. If the company doesn\u2019t raise prices, while production costs increase, the company\u2019s profits will decrease.\n\nThe most common cause of cost-push inflation starts with an increase in thecost of production, which may be expected or unexpected. For example, the cost of raw materials or inventory used in production might increase, leading to higher costs.\n\nFor cost-push inflation to take place,demandfor the affected product must remain constant during the time the production cost changes are occurring. To compensate for the increased cost of production, producers raise\u00a0the price to the consumer to maintain profit levels while keeping pace with expected demand.\n\nAs stated earlier, an increase in the cost of input goods used in manufacturing, such as raw materials, is a cause of cost-push inflation. For example, if companies use copper in the manufacturing process and the price of the metal suddenly rises, companies might pass those increased costs on to their customers.\n\nIncreased labor costs can create cost-push inflation, such as when mandatory wage increases for production employees due to an increase in the minimum wage per worker. A worker strike due to stalled contract negotiations might also lead to a decline in production and, as a result, lead to higher prices.\n\nUnexpected causes of cost-push inflation are often natural disasters, which can include floods, earthquakes, fires, or tornadoes. If a large disaster causes unexpected damage to a production facility and results in a shutdown or partial disruption of the production chain, higher production costs are likely to follow. A company might have no choice but to increase prices to help recoup some of the losses from a disaster. However, not all natural disasters result in higher production costs and, therefore, wouldn\u2019t lead to cost-push inflation.\n\nOther events might qualify if they lead to higher production costs, such as a sudden change in government that affects the country\u2019s ability to maintain its previous output. However, government-induced increases in production costs are more often seen in developing nations.\n\nGovernment regulations and changes in current laws, although usually anticipated, may cause costs to rise for businesses because they have no way to compensate for the increased costs associated with them. For example, the government might mandate that healthcare be provided, driving up the cost of employees or labor.\n\nTwenty-one U.S. states raised theirminimum wageon Jan. 1, 2025. They are:\n\nRising prices caused by consumers wanting more goods is called demand-pull inflation. Demand-pull inflation includes times when an increase in demand is so great that production can\u2019t keep up, which typically results in higher prices. In short,cost-push inflation is driven by supply costs while demand-pull inflation is driven by consumer demand\u2014while both lead to higher prices passed on to consumers.\n\nTheOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)is acartelthat consists of 12 member countries that both produce and export oil.In the early 1970s, due to geopolitical events, OPEC imposed an oil embargo on the United States and other countries. OPEC banned oil exports to targeted countries and also imposed oil production cuts.\n\nWhat followed was asupply shockand a quadrupling of the price of oil from approximately $3 to $12 per barrel.Cost-push inflation ensued since there was no increase in demand for the commodity.\u00a0The impact of the supply cut led to a surge in gas prices as well as higher production costs for companies that used petroleum products.\n\nInflation, or a general rise in prices, is thought to occur for several reasons, and the exact reasons are still debated by economists. Monetarist theories suggest that the money supply is the root of inflation, where more money in an economy leads to higher prices. Cost-push inflation theorizes that as costs to producers increase from things like rising wages, these higher costs are passed on to consumers. Demand-pull inflation takes the position that prices rise when aggregate demand exceeds thesupplyof available goods for sustained periods of time.\n\nIn theory, a low amount of inflation can be a healthy sign of a growing economy.High inflation, however, can be damaging (but deflation, or declining prices, can be as well). Note that inflation isn\u2019t always bad for certain groups of people. For example, borrowers at fixed interest rates tend to benefit from inflation, while lenders and savers are hurt by it.\n\nThewage-price spiral, a take on cost-push inflation, occurs when wages rise, creating more demand, which leads to higher prices. These higher prices thus incentivize workers to demand even higher wages, and so the cycle repeats.\n\nCost-push inflation occurs when overall\u00a0prices increase due to increases in the cost of wages and raw materials. It can also occur when higher costs of production decrease the aggregate supply in the economy. When production falls while demand for goods remains changed, price increases from production are passed on to consumers, creating cost-push inflation.\n\nEconomic Policy Institute. \u201cOver 9.2 Million Workers Will Get a Raise on January 1 from 21 States Raising Their Minimum Wages.\u201d\n\nOrganization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. \u201cMember Countries.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian. \u201cOil Embargo, 1973\u20131974.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve History. \u201cOil Shock of 1973\u201374.\u201d\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \u201cWhy Does the Federal Reserve Aim for Inflation of 2 Percent Over the Longer Run?\u201d",
