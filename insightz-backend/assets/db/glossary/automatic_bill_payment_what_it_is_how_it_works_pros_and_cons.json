This way, you'll know your payment will never be late, and you\u2019ll avoid the trouble of doing the same task each month. You'll also maintain or improve agood credit score.\n\nAutomatic bill payments save you the hassle of having toremember to make a paymentmonth after month. They can also help you avoid late payments.

It's possible you'll forget about certain automatic payments and continue to pay for services that you no longer want.\n\nAnd if you forget about your scheduled automatic payments and don't maintain a cushion in your checking account, an automatic payment could bounce. Not only will your bill remain unpaid, but you might also incur areturned payment feefrom the company you were trying to pay, as well as alate feefor missing the due date. Your bank will also charge you a fee for the bounced transaction.\n\nYou can auto pay almost any transaction, from credit cards to mortgages.\n\nAn automatic bill payment (auto pay) is a routine payment made from a banking, brokerage, or mutual fund account to vendors. Though auto pay comes with some benefits\u2014you're guaranteed to have your bills paid on time, for example\u2014there are also some downsides.
