  "definition": "The Merton model is a mathematical formula that stock analysts and commercial loan officers, among others, can use to judge a corporation\u2019s risk of credit default. Named for economist Robert C. Merton, who proposed it in 1974, the Merton model assesses the structuralcredit riskof a company by modeling itsequityas a call option on its assets.\n\nE=VtN(d1)\u2212Ke\u2212r\u0394TN(d2)where:d1=ln\u2061VtK+(r+\u03c3v22)\u0394T\u03c3v\u0394Tandd2=d1\u2212\u03c3v\u0394tE\u00a0=\u00a0Theoretical\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0equityVt=Value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0assets\u00a0in\u00a0period\u00a0tK\u00a0=\u00a0Value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0debtt\u00a0=\u00a0Current\u00a0time\u00a0periodT\u00a0=\u00a0Future\u00a0time\u00a0periodr\u00a0=\u00a0Risk-free\u00a0interest\u00a0rateN\u00a0=\u00a0Cumulative\u00a0standard\u00a0normal\u00a0distributione\u00a0=\u00a0Exponential\u00a0term(i.e.2.7183...)\u03c3=Standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0stock\u00a0returns\\begin{aligned} &E=V_tN\\left(d_1\\right)-Ke^{-r\\Delta{T}}N\\left(d_2\\right)\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &d_1=\\frac{\\ln{\\frac{V_t}{K}}+\\left(r+\\frac{\\sigma_v^2}{2}\\right)\\Delta{T}}{\\sigma_v\\sqrt{\\Delta{T}}}\\\\ &\\text{and}\\\\ &d_2=d_1-\\sigma_v\\sqrt{\\Delta{t}}\\\\ &\\text{E = Theoretical value of a company's equity}\\\\ &V_t=\\text{Value of the company's assets in period t}\\\\ &\\text{K = Value of the company's debt}\\\\ &\\text{t = Current time period}\\\\ &\\text{T = Future time period}\\\\ &\\text{r = Risk-free interest rate}\\\\ &\\text{N = Cumulative standard normal distribution}\\\\ &\\text{e = Exponential term}\\left(i.e. \\text{ }2.7183...\\right)\\\\ &\\sigma=\\text{Standard deviation of stock returns}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bE=Vt\u200bN(d1\u200b)\u2212Ke\u2212r\u0394TN(d2\u200b)where:d1\u200b=\u03c3v\u200b\u0394T\u200blnKVt\u200b\u200b+(r+2\u03c3v2\u200b\u200b)\u0394T\u200bandd2\u200b=d1\u200b\u2212\u03c3v\u200b\u0394t\u200bE\u00a0=\u00a0Theoretical\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0a\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0equityVt\u200b=Value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0assets\u00a0in\u00a0period\u00a0tK\u00a0=\u00a0Value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0company\u2019s\u00a0debtt\u00a0=\u00a0Current\u00a0time\u00a0periodT\u00a0=\u00a0Future\u00a0time\u00a0periodr\u00a0=\u00a0Risk-free\u00a0interest\u00a0rateN\u00a0=\u00a0Cumulative\u00a0standard\u00a0normal\u00a0distributione\u00a0=\u00a0Exponential\u00a0term(i.e.2.7183...)\u03c3=Standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0stock\u00a0returns\u200b\n\nThe Merton model allows for easiervaluationof a company and helps analysts determine if it will be able to retainsolvency, by analyzing thematurity datesof its debt and itsdebttotals.\n\nThe Merton model calculates the theoretical pricing of Europeanputandcall optionswithout considering dividends paid out during the life of the option. The model can, however, be adapted to consider dividends by calculating theex-dividenddate value of underlying stocks.\n\nThe Merton model makes the following basic assumptions:\n\nVariables that are taken into consideration in the formula include options\u2019strike prices, present underlying prices, risk-free interest rates, and the amount of time before expiration.\n\nRobert C. Mertonis a noted American economist and Nobel Prize laureate, who purchased his first stock at age 10. He earned a bachelor of science in engineering at Columbia University, a master of science in applied mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, and a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later became a professor.\n\nDuring Merton\u2019s time at MIT, he and fellow economists Fischer Black and Myron S. Scholes were all working on problems related to the pricing ofoptionsand often aided in each other\u2019s work. Black and Scholes published a seminal paper on the topic, \u201cThe Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,\u201d in 1973.Merton\u2019s \u201cOn the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates,\u201d published early the following year, described what has come to be known as the Merton model.\n\nMerton and Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1997 (Black had died and was no longer eligible). The prize committee cited them for developing \u201ca pioneering formula for the valuation of stock options. Their methodology has paved the way for economic valuations in many areas. It has also generated new types of financial instruments and facilitated more efficient risk management in society.\u201d\n\nTheir best-known collaboration is often referred to today as theBlack-Scholes-Merton model.\n\nA call option is a contract that allows the buyer to purchase a stock or other financial asset at a specified price by or on a certain date.\n\nEuropean options can beexercisedonly on theirexpiration date, while American options can be exercised anytime.\n\nArisk-free interest rateis the theoretical rate of return on an investment carrying zero risk. It is theoretical because no investment is entirely without risk, although some come closer than others.\n\nThe Merton model, developed by economist Robert C. Merton, is a mathematical formula that assesses the structural credit risk of a company by modeling its equity as a call option on its assets. It is often used by stock analysts and commercial loan officers to ascertain a corporation\u2019s likely risk of credit default.\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Sloan School of Management. \u201cRobert C.
