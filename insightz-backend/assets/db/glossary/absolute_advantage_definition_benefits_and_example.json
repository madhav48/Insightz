  "definition": "An entity establishes an absolute advantage over its competitors when it can produce more with the same inputs they're using.\n\nAbsolute advantage is accomplished by creating a good or service at alowerabsolute cost per unitusing a smaller number of inputs. It can also be achieved by a moreefficient process.\n\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bfInvestopedia / Yurle Villegas\n\nThe concept of absolute advantage was developed by 18th-century economistAdam Smithin his book \"The Wealth of Nations\" to show how countries can gain from trade by specializing in producing and exporting the goods that they can produce more efficiently than other countries. Countries with an absolute advantage can decide to specialize in producing and selling a specific good or service and use the generated funds to purchase goods and services from other countries.\n\nSmith argued that specializing in the products in which they have an absolute advantage and then trading the products can make all countries better off, as long as they each have at least one product for which they hold an absolute advantage over other nations.\n\nAbsolute advantage explains why it makes sense for individuals, businesses, and countries totradewith each other. Since each has advantages in producing certain goods and services, both entities can benefit from the exchange.\n\nThis mutual gain from trade forms the basis of Smith\u2019s argument thatspecialization, the division of labor, and subsequent trade lead to an overall increase in prosperity from which all can benefit. This, Smith believed, was the root source of the eponymous \"Wealth of Nations.\"\n\nAbsolute advantage can be contrasted withcomparative advantage, which is when a producer has a loweropportunity costto produce a good or service than another producer. An opportunity cost is the potential benefits an individual, investor, or business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another.\n\nAbsolute advantage leads to unambiguous gains from specialization and trade only in cases where each producer has an absolute advantage in producing some good. If a producer lacks any absolute advantage, then Adam Smith\u2019s argument would not necessarily apply.\n\nHowever, the producer and its trading partners might still be able to realize gains from trade if they can specialize based on their respective comparative advantages instead.In his bookOn the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,David Ricardoargued that even if a country has an absolute advantage over trading many kinds of goods, it can still benefit by trading with other countries that have different comparative advantages.\n\nBoth Smith's theory of absolute advantage and Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage, rely on certain assumptions and simplifications to explain the benefits of trade.\n\nBoth theories assume that there are no barriers to trade. They do not account for any costs of shipping or additional tariffs that a country might raise on another's imported goods.In the real world, though, shipping costs impact how likely both the importer and exporter are to engage in trade. Countries can also leverage tariffs to create advantages for themselves or disadvantages for competitors.\n\nBoth theories also assume that the factors of production are immobile. In these models, workers and businesses do not relocate in search of better opportunities. This assumption was realistic in the 1700s.\n\nIn modern trade, however,globalizationhas now made it easy for companies to move their factories abroad. It has also increased the rate of immigration, which impacts a country's available workforce. In some industries, businesses will work with governments to create immigration opportunities for workers that are essential to their business operations.\n\nMore crucially, these theories both assume that a country's absolute advantage is constant and scales equally. In other words, it assumes that producing a small number of goods has the same per-unit cost as a larger number and that countries are unable to change their absolute advantages.\n\nIn reality, countries often make strategicinvestments to create greater advantagesin certain industries. Absolute advantage can also change for reasons other than investment. Natural disasters, for example, can destroy farmland, factories, and other factors of production.\n\nOne advantage of the theory of absolute advantage is its simplicity: The theory provides an elegant explanation of the benefits of trade, showing how countries can benefit by focusing on their absolute advantages.\n\nHowever, the theory of comparative advantage does not fully explain why nations benefit from trade. This explanation would later fall to Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage: Even if one country has an absolute advantage inbothtypes of goods, it will still be better off through trade. In other words, if one country can produce all goods more cheaply than its trading partners, it will still benefit by trading with other countries.\n\nAlso, as explained earlier, the theory also assumes that absolute advantages are static\u2014a country cannot change its absolute advantages, and they do not become more efficient with scale. Actual experience has shown this to be untrue: Many countries have successfully created an absolute advantage by investing in strategic industries.\n\nIn fact, the theory has been used to justify exploitative economic policies in the postcolonial era. Reasoning that all countries should focus on their advantages, major bodies like the World Bank and IMF have often pressured developing countries to focus on agricultural exports, rather than industrialization. As a result, many of these countries remain at a low level of economic development.\n\nSimple illustration of why countries can benefit by trading on their advantages.\n\nLacks the explanatory power of the theory of comparative advantage.\n\nDoes not account for costs or barriers to trade.\n\nHas been used to justify exploitative policies.\n\nConsider two hypothetical countries, Atlantica and Pacifica, with equivalent populations and resource endowments, with each producing two products: butter and bacon. Each year, Atlantica can produce either 12 tubs of butter or six slabs of bacon, while Pacifica can produce either six tubs of butter or 12 slabs of bacon.\n\nEach country needs a minimum of four tubs of butter and four slabs of bacon to survive. In a state ofautarky,producing solely on their own for their own needs,Atlantica can spend one-third of the year making butter and two-thirds of the year making bacon, for a total of four tubs of butter and four slabs of bacon.\n\nPacifica can spend one-third of the year making bacon and two-thirds making butter to produce the same: four tubs of butter and four slabs of bacon. This leaves each country on the brink of survival, with barely enough butter and bacon to go around. However, note that Atlantica has an absolute advantage in producing butter and Pacifica has an absolute advantage in producing bacon.\n\nIf each country were to specialize in its absolute advantage, Atlantica could make 12 tubs of butter and no bacon in a year, while Pacifica makes no butter and 12 slabs of bacon.By specializing, the two countries divide the tasks of their labor between them.\n\nIf they then trade six tubs of butter for six slabs of bacon, each country would then have six of each. Both countries would now be better off than before, because each would have six tubs of butter and six slabs of bacon, as opposed to four of each good which they could produce on their own.\n\nThe concept of absolute advantage was developed by Adam Smith inThe Wealth of Nationsto show how countries can gain by specializing in producing and exporting the goods that they produce more efficiently than other countries, and by importing goods that other countries produce more efficiently. Specializing in and trading products that they have an absolute advantage in can benefit both countries as long as they each have at least one product for which they hold an absolute advantage over the other.\n\nAbsolute advantage is the ability of an entity to produce a product or service at a lower absolute cost per unit using a smaller number of inputs or a more efficient process than another entity producing the same good or service. Comparative advantage refers to the ability to produce goods and services at a lower opportunity cost, not necessarily at a greater volume or quality.\n\nA clear example of a nation with an absolute advantage is Saudi Arabia, a country with abundant oil supplies that provide it with an absolute advantage over other nations.\n\nOther examples include Colombia and its climate\u2014ideally suited to growing coffee\u2014and Zambia, possessing some of the world\u2019s richest copper mines.For Saudi Arabia to try and grow coffee and Colombia to drill for oil would be an extremely costly and, likely, unproductive undertaking.\n\nThe theory of absolute advantage represents Adam Smith's explanation of why countries benefit from trade, by exporting goods where they have an absolute advantage and importing other goods. While the theory is an elegant and simple illustration of the benefits of trade, it doesn't fully explain the benefits of international trade. That would later fall to David Ricardo's theory of comparative advantages.\n\nProject Gutenberg. \"The Project Gutenberg eBook of An Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, by Adam Smith.\"\n\nBritannica. \"Comparative Advantage.\"\n\nBritannica. \"Absolute Advantage.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Joint Statement by the Heads of the Food and Agriculture Organization, International Monetary Fund, World Bank Group, World Food Programme, and World Trade Organization on the Global Food Security Crisis.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"Agriculture and Food.\"\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \"Saudi Arabia.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \"Zambia Overview.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Foreign Agricultural Service. \"Colombia: Coffee Annual.\"",
