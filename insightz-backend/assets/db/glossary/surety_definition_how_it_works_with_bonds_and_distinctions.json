  "term": "Surety: Definition, How It Works With Bonds, and Distinctions",
  "definition": "A surety is a promise or agreement made by one party that debts and financial obligations will be paid. In effect, a surety acts as a guarantee that a person or an organization assumes responsibility for fulfilling financial obligations in the event that the debtordefaultsand is unable to make payments. The party that guarantees the debt is referred to as the surety or theguarantor. Sureties can be made by issuing surety bonds, which are legal contracts obligating one party to pay if the other fails to live up to the agreement.\n\nAs noted above, a surety is a guarantee or promise that assures payment through a legally binding contract. Under the agreement, one party promises to fulfill the financial obligations if the second party (thedebtor)fails to pay the third party (thecreditor).\n\nThe surety is the company that provides aline of creditto guarantee payment of any claim. They provide afinancial guaranteeto the obligee that the principal will fulfill their obligations. A principal\u2019s obligations could mean complying with state laws and regulations pertaining to a specific business license or meeting the terms of a construction contract. An example of such a contract would be when a surety companyvets and hires an administratorto handle a will or estate.\n\nIf the principal fails to deliver on the terms of the contract entered into with the obligee, then the obligee has the right to file a claim against the bond to recover any damages or losses incurred. If the claim is valid, the surety company will pay reparation that cannot exceed the bond amount. The underwriters will then expect the principal to reimburse them for any claims paid.\n\nA surety is most common in contracts in which one party questions whether thecounterpartyin the contract will be able to fulfill all requirements. The party may require the counterparty to come forward with a guarantorto reduce risk, with the guarantor entering into a contract of suretyship. This is intended to lower risk to thelender, which might, in turn, lowerinterest ratesfor the borrower. A surety can be in the form of a surety bond.\n\nThe claim amount in a surety is still retrieved from the principal, either throughcollateralposted by the principal or through other means.\n\nA surety is not abank guarantee. Similarly, it is not an insurance policy. Where the surety is liable for any performanceriskposed by the principal, the bank guarantee is liable for the financial risk of the contracted project.\n\nThe payment made to the surety company is paying for the bond, but the principal is still liable for the debt. The surety is only required to relieve the obligee of the time and resources that will be used to recover any loss or damage from a principal.\n\nA surety bond is a legally binding contract. It is used as an assurance that the issuer will pay any debts if the other party fails to do so. Surety bonds are entered into by three parties:\n\nHere's how it works. The principal is responsible for securing the surety bond, which must abide by certain conditions, including the total amount owed. If the principal defaults or breaks the contract, the obligee, who is owed the money, can file a claim seeking restitution. The surety (or the party issuing the bond) can review the claim and decide. If the claim is paid, the surety can then seek financialcompensationfrom the principal. This includes interest and fees on top of the principal balance.\n\nSurety bonds can be used in a number of different circumstances. The table below outlines some of the most common types of surety bonds:\n\nThere's some important distinctions between a surety bond andinsurancethat are worth calling out. A surety bond is a three-party agreement that guarantees the performance of an obligation, while insurance is a two-party agreement that provides financial protection against specific risks.\n\nOne of the key differences between surety bonds and insurance lies in how claims are handled. When an insurance claim is made, the insurer compensates the insured for covered losses according to the policy terms. This compensation is typically final, and the insured does not have to repay the insurer.\n\nWhen a claim is made against a surety bond, the surety may pay the obligee to cover the costs of the principal's failure to meet their obligations. However, unlike insurance, the principal is legally obligated to repay the surety for any claims paid out. This reimbursement clause ensures that the principal bears the ultimate financial responsibility, making surety bonds more like aform of creditthan traditional insurance.\n\nThe purpose behind obtaining a surety bond versus insurance also differs. Surety bonds are primarily used to ensure that contractual obligations are met, often in the context of construction, environmental projects, or other business agreements. They assure the obligee that the principal will fulfill their commitments or face financial consequences. Insurance, on the other hand, is designed to protect the insured from unforeseen risks, such as accidents, natural disasters, or health issues.\n\nImagine a real estate developer planning to build a new residential community on a large tract of land. The local government mandates that the developer complete extensive landscaping and environmental restoration as part of the project. This work includes planting trees, creating green spaces, and restoring disturbed wetlands.\n\nTo ensure the developer meets these commitments, the government requires the developer to obtain a surety bond specifically for the landscaping and environmental tasks. In this scenario, the developer approaches a surety bond company to secure the required bond. The obligee is the local government which wants to guarantee that the developer will fulfill the obligations. The surety bond ensures that if the developer fails to complete the landscaping or properly restore the environment, the local government can claim the bond.\n\nThe surety, having issued the bond, would then be responsible for either hiring another contractor to finish the work or compensating the government for the costs associated with completing the tasks. This arrangement protects the government and the community from bearing the financial burden of unfinished environmental work, while also holding the developer accountable for meeting their environmental responsibilities.\n\nA surety is the guarantee of the debts of one party by another. This is intended to lower risk to the lender, which might, in turn, lower interest rates for the borrower.\n\nA surety bond protects an obligee against losses, up to the limit of the bond. The bond amount is the monetary limit up to which the obligee requires the bond to be issued.\n\nSurety bonds provide a defense against false claims and act as clear-cut representation when claims occur. Because surety bonds also lower risk for lenders, they can reduce interest rates for borrowers.\n\nA surety is a person or party that takes responsibility for the debt, default, or other financial responsibilities of another party. A surety is often used in contracts in which one party\u2019s financial holdings or well-being are in question and the other party wants a guarantor.\n\nSurety bonds are financial instruments that tie the principal, the obligee\u2014often a government entity\u2014and the surety. In the case of surety bonds, the surety is providing a line of credit to the principal so as to reassure the obligee that the principal will fulfill their side of the agreement.",
