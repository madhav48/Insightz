  "term": "Free-Float Methodology and How to Calculate Market Capitalization",
  "definition": "The free-float methodology is a method of calculating themarket capitalizationof a stock market index's underlying companies. With the free-float methodology, market capitalization is calculated by taking theequity'sprice and multiplying it by the number of shares readily available in the market.\n\nRather than using all of the shares (both active and inactive shares), as is the case with the full-market capitalization method, the free-float method excludes locked-in shares, such as those held by insiders, promoters, and governments.\n\nThe free-float methodology is sometimes referred to as float-adjusted capitalization. According to some experts, the free-float method is considered to be a better way of calculating market capitalization (as opposed to the full-market capitalization method, for example).\n\nFull-market capitalization includes all of the shares provided by a company through its stock issuance plan. Companies often issue unexercised stock to insiders throughstock optioncompensation plans.\n\nOther holders of unexercised stock can include promoters and governments. Full market capitalization weighting for indexes is rarely used and would significantly change the return dynamic of an index because companies have various levels of strategic plans in place for issuing stock options and exercisable shares.\n\nThe free-float methodology is usually thought to provide a more accurate reflection ofmarket movementsand stocks actively available for trading in the market. When using a free-float methodology, the resulting market capitalization is smaller than what would result from a full market capitalization method.\n\nAn index that uses a free-float methodology tends to reflect market trends because it only takes into consideration the shares that are available for trade. It also makes the index more broad-based because it lessens the concentration of the top few companies in the index.\n\nFree-float methodology is calculated as follows:\n\nFFM = Share Price x (Number of Shares Issued \u2013 Locked-In Shares)\n\nThe free-float methodology has been adopted by many of the world's major indexes. It is used by the S&P 500 Index, by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) World Index, and by the Financial Times Stock Exchange Group (FTSE) 100 Index.\n\nThere is also a relationship between free-float methodology andvolatility. The number of free-floating shares of a company is inversely correlated to volatility. Typically, a larger free-float means that the stock\u2019s volatility is lower because there are more traders buying and selling the shares.\n\nThat means that a smaller free float equates to higher volatility (since fewer trades move the price significantly and there are a limited amount of shares available to be bought and/or sold). Mostinstitutional investorsprefer trading companies with a larger free float because they can buy or sell a large number of shares without having a big impact on the price.\n\nIndexesin the market are usually weighted by either price or market capitalization. Both methodologies weigh\u00a0the returns of the indexes\u2019 individual stocks by their respective weighting types. Market capitalization weighting is the most common index-weighting methodology. The leading capitalization-weighted index in the United States is theS&P 500Index.\n\nThe type of weighting methodology used by an index significantly affects the index\u2019s overall returns. Price-weighted indexes calculate the returns of an index by weighing the individual stock returns of the index by their price levels.\n\nIn a price-weighted index, stocks with a higher price receive a higher weighting and, thus, have more influence on the returns of the index (regardless of their market capitalizations). Price-weighted indexes versus capitalization-weighted indexes vary considerably due to their index methodology.\n\nIn the trading market, very few indexes are price-weighted. TheDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)is an example of one of the few price-weighted indexes in the market.\n\nSuppose that stock ABC is trading at $100 and has 125,000 shares in total. Out of this amount, 25,000 shares are locked in (meaning that they are held by large institutional investors and company management and are not available for trading). Using the free-float methodology, ABC's market capitalization is 100 x 100,000 (total number of shares available for trading) = $10 million.\n\nTo calculate free float, you take a company's outstanding shares and subtract its restricted shares. To get the company's free-float market capitalization, take the free-float number and multiply it by a company's share price.\n\nYes, the S&P 500 Index utilizes a free-float methodology. This means that for all of the companies in the S&P 500, their market cap is free floating\u2014only the available shares for public trading are taken into consideration for the calculation; no restricted shares.\n\nMarket cap, or market capitalization, is calculated by taking a company's outstanding shares and multiplying them by the company's share price. For example, if a company had 50,000 shares outstanding and a share price of $10, its market cap would be $500,000.\n\nFree-float methodology is a method of calculating a company's market cap by removing its locked-in shares. It is used by index providers in order to present a more accurate picture of a company's available shares for trading.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Float Adjustment Methodology,\" Page 2.",
