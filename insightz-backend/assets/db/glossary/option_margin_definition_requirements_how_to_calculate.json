In the case of stocks and futures, a margin is used asleverageto increase buying power, whereas an option margin is used ascollateralto secure a position.\n\nMinimum\u00a0margin requirements for various types of underlying securities are established byFINRAand the options exchanges. Brokers may have very different margin requirements since they can add to the minimum requirements set by regulators. Some option\u00a0strategies, such ascovered callsand covered puts,\u00a0have no margin requirement since the underlying stock is used as collateral.\n\nTraders must request optionstrading authorizationwhen opening a new account. Often, brokers will classify options trading clearance levels depending on the type of strategies employed. Buying options is typically a Level I clearance since it doesn't require margin, but sellingnaked putsmay require Level II clearances and a margin account. Level III and IV accounts often have lower margin requirements.\n\nOption margin requirements can have a significant impact on the profitability of a trade since it ties up capital. Complex strategies, such asstranglesandstraddles, may involve computing multiple margin requirements. Traders should determine the margin requirements for a trade before entering into it and make sure that they can meet those requirements if the market turns against them.\n\nCertain option positions do not require margins. For example, there are no margin requirements for long options, whether they are puts or calls. In other instances, traders can use several different strategies to avoid option margin requirements.\n\nThe easiest way to calculate option margin requirements is using theChicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE)Margin Calculatorthat provides exact margin requirements for specific trades. Traders can also see the minimum requirements in the CBOE'sMargin Manual. Brokerage accounts may have similar tools available to provide an idea of the cost before entering into a trade.\n\nNational Archives, Code of Federal Regulations. \"Part 220 - Credit by Brokers and Dealers (Regulation T).\"\n\nFINRA. \"Margin Account Requirements.\"",
