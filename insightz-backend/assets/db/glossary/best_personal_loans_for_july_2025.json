The best personal loans feature low annual percentage rates (APRs), no fees, repayment terms that fit your budget, and an easy application process.\n\nInvestopedia rigorously researched 59 lenders and ranked them on those features, including criteria informed by a survey of hundreds of personal loan borrowers. LightStream, the online lending subsidiary of Truist Bank, ticks all the boxes (competitive APRs, no fees, flexible repayment terms) and is our choice for the best personal loan.\n\nHowever, another lender may be better for you, depending on your circumstances. Learn more about LightStream and Investopedia\u2019s other picks below.\n\nA personal loan can help you cover an emergency expense, consolidate debt, make a home improvement, and more. The best personal loans feature low annual percentage rates (APRs), no fees, repayment terms that fit your budget, and an easy application process.\n\nInvestopedia rigorously researched 59 lenders and ranked them on those features, including criteria informed by a survey of hundreds of personal loan borrowers. LightStream, the online lending subsidiary of Truist Bank, ticks all the boxes (competitive APRs, no fees, flexible repayment terms) and is our choice for the best personal loan.\n\nHowever, another lender may be better for you, depending on your circumstances. Learn more about LightStream and Investopedia\u2019s other picks below.\n\nLightStream makes our list twice, as Best Overall and Best for Large Loan Amounts. It hit the sweet spot in our scoring rubric: low APRs, a wide range of loan amounts, and a very wide range of repayment options. If you need a large sum, for a home improvement or a boat, LightStream lends up to $100,000. You\u2019ll have up to 20 years to repay for specific loan uses (like home improvements).\n\nLoan terms up to 240 months (20 years)\n\nRequires good to excellent credit\n\nLimited customer support options\n\nIn our research, LightStream scored well in all the areas that matter most to most borrowers. Its advertised APRs are competitive, and there are no fees, not even for late payments. It offers lengthy repayment terms and loan amounts of up to $100,000. With autopay, you can shave 0.50% of your APR. If you find a better rate on an unsecured loan from another lender, LightStream will beat it by 0.10%.\n\nFund dispersal is fast, as soon as the same day if you accept a loan proposal before 2:30 p.m. ET. You can also delay funding up to 90 days, which can help if you\u2019re planning a home improvement and don\u2019t want to begin repaying a loan before you\u2019ve spent any of it.\n\nAlthough LightStream is our top choice, it has some flaws. The most glaring is the lack of loan pre-qualification, which Investopedia considers an important shopping tool. You\u2019ll have to complete an application to find out your loan details, which means a small hit to your credit score.\n\nLightStream\u2019s minimum loan amount of $5,000 may be too high for some borrowers, depending on their needs. LightStream is a solid choice if you have good to excellent credit, but you\u2019ll have to shop elsewhere if you don't. Finally, we also found LightStream\u2019s customer service options to be lacking as they are limited to telephone support.\n\nLightStream is the online-lending arm of Truist Bank, which was formed by a merger between BB&T and SunTrust Bank in 2019. Truist is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSoFi, a former Best Overall winner in Investopedia\u2019s ranking, offers loans of up to $100,000, highly rated customer service, pre-qualification, and a bevy of SoFi membership benefits.\n\nAccess to SoFi membership benefits\n\nCan\u2019t apply with a co-signer, but co-borrowers are accepted\n\nYou can find lenders offering lower rates and more flexible loan minimums. But only a few lenders we researched offer loan amounts up to $100,000, and only one, specialty lender BHG Financial, offers larger ones (up to $200,000). Plus, you\u2019re unlikely to find a lender that offers more customer perks and benefits than SoFi. Those benefits include free financial advice and discounts on the other banking and financial products it offers.\n\nThat focus on customer experience is working for SoFi. It ranked fourth in J.D. Power\u2019s 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.Sofi also received an Investopedia Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.4 (out of 5 possible), a calculated aggregate of consumer review ratings on Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau developed by Investopedia\u2019s researchers.\n\nLike LightStream, SoFi has a high loan minimum of $5,000, so if you need a smaller loan, you must look elsewhere. In years past, the lender touted its lack of fees. That\u2019s changed now, and SoFi offers borrowers the option to pay an origination fee of up to 7% in exchange for a lower interest rate overall. You still won\u2019t face late fees andprepayment fees.\n\nSan Francisco-based SoFi was founded in 2011 as a fintech specializing in student loans. Today, it offers a full suite of banking and financial products, including checking and savings accounts, home loans, investment accounts, insurance, and more.\n\nFixed rates from 8.99% APR to 35.49% APR. APR reflects the 0.25% autopay discount and a 0.25% direct deposit discount. SoFi Platform personal loans are made either by SoFi Bank, N.A. or, Cross River Bank, a New Jersey State Chartered Commercial Bank, Member FDIC, Equal Housing Lender. SoFi may receive compensation if you take out a loan originated by Cross River Bank. These rate ranges are current as of 04/24/25 and are subject to change without notice. Not all rates and amounts available in all states. See SoFi Personal Loan eligibility details athttps://www.sofi.com/eligibility-criteria/#eligibility-personal. Not all applicants qualify for the lowest rate. Lowest rates reserved for the most creditworthy borrowers. Your actual rate will be within the range of rates listed above and will depend on a variety of factors, including evaluation of your credit worthiness, income, and other factors. Loan amounts range from $5,000\u2013 $100,000. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 9.99% of your loan amount for Cross River Bank originated loans which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive and for SoFi Bank originated loans have an origination fee of 0%-7%, will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. The SoFi 0.25% autopay interest rate reduction requires you to agree to make monthly principal and interest payments by an automatic monthly deduction from a savings or checking account. The benefit will discontinue and be lost for periods in which you do not pay by automatic deduction from a savings or checking account. Autopay is not required to receive a loan from SoFi. To be eligible to receive an additional (0.25%) interest rate reduction on your Personal Loan (your \u201cLoan\u201d), you must set up Direct deposit with a SoFi Checking and Savings account offered by SoFi Bank, N.A., or enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee, all within 30 days of the funding of your Loan. Once eligible, you will receive this discount during periods in which you have enabled Direct Deposit to an eligible Direct Deposit Account in accordance with SoFi\u2019s reasonable procedures and requirements to be determined at SoFi\u2019s sole discretion, or during periods in which SoFi successfully receives payment of the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. This discount will be lost during periods in which SoFi determines you have turned off Direct Deposit to your Checking and Savings account or in which you have not paid for the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee. You are not required to enroll in Direct Deposit or to pay the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee to receive a Loan.\n\nDiscover, with competitive APRs and no origination fee, is a good choice for personal loans for any reason. But because it will pay your creditors directly, it\u2019s an especially good choice for debt consolidation.\n\nExcellent customer satisfaction ratings\n\nCan\u2019t be used for secured debt consolidation\n\nWe picked Discover as the best lender fordebt consolidationbecause of its low advertised APRs, range of repayment terms, and the option to have Discover pay your creditors directly. This is convenient for you but also offers a bit of risk reduction for the lender. Loan funding is fast, as soon as the next business day, if everything in your application is accurate.\n\nDiscover\u2019s reputation for customer service was borne out during our research. Our reviewers rated the website and its broad collection of tools, calculators, and educational material a 4 (out of 5 possible). Meanwhile, Discover rated second in the J.D. Powers 2024 U.S. Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study.\n\nOne downside with Discover is that it does not accept co-signers or co-borrowers who can help borrowers with lower credit scores qualify for a loan. The maximum loan amount ($40,000) is not as high as many competing lenders, although the lower minimum ($2,500) makes it a good choice if you\u2019re looking for a smaller loan.\n\nDiscover, founded in 1986, was a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck & Company, which was created to offer Sears shoppers credit card services. Today, from its headquarters in Illinois, it offers credit cards, home loans, CDs, and savings and checking accounts.\n\nUpgrade is our choice for emergencies and quick funding because of its fast funding time and relaxed lending criteria, which makes a loan from Upgrade available to a broad range of borrowers in a pinch. You\u2019ll pay for the convenience with origination fees as high as 9.99% and APRs that reach nearly 36%.\n\nLow minimum credit score requirement\n\n$200 checking account bonus offer\n\nMay offer a secured loan option\n\nPotentially high APR for some applicants\n\nUpgrade accepts applicants with fair credit scores\u2014as low as 580. You can apply with a co-borrower, too, if you need help getting approved or want to try for a better rate. Upgrade may also offer you asecured loan, using your car as collateral, instead of an unsecured loan.\n\nYou\u2019ll pay for this flexibility, though. Upgrade charges origination fees between 1.85% and 9.99%, and its maximum APR is 35.99%. Borrowers with thin or weak credit profiles should expect to pay on the higher end of those ranges. Discounts for setting up autopay, using loan proceeds for debt consolidation, and opting for a secured loan are available, but the lender doesn\u2019t reveal the details. A $200 bonus is also available for setting up and funding a checking account with Upgrade during your loan application. You can fund your new account with your loan funds.\n\nUpgrade was founded in 2017 and is headquartered in San Francisco, Calif. Since its founding, it has provided more than $35 billion in loans and credit.\n\nUpstart says its AI loan underwriting system results in lower-cost loans for more borrowers with less risk to the lender. In practice, that means it accepts borrowers with credit scores as low as 300. Moreover, students and college graduates with an income can qualify without a credit history.\n\nPotentially high origination fee\n\nFewer loan term options than competitors\n\nIf your credit score is below 580, you don\u2019t have many options to borrow. Loan offers you do receive will be expensive, with high origination fees and APRs.Upstart\u2019s minimum required credit score of 300 is the lowest of the 59 lenders in our database. It will even consider borrowers without a credit score. Despite this flexibility, its rates, fees, and terms are not prohibitively expensive.\n\nUpstart works with various lenders withdifferent underwriting requirements, so borrowers with weaker or stronger credit profiles will match with lenders offering rates and terms that fit. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $50,000, covering a range of borrower needs.\n\nRates start at 6.60% and max out at 35.99%, the industry's de facto APR cap. (That rate cap is linked to the Military Lending Act, which limits APRs on consumer loans for military service members at 36%.)\n\nUpstart has made available nearly $40 billion in credit of various types through its platform, including personal loans, since it was founded in 2012. The fintech lender is headquartered in San Mateo, Calif.\n\nNot all major national banks offer unsecured personal loans (Bank of America, for example), but Citibank rated the highest in our scoring among those that do. The bank\u2019s maximum advertised APR is low, and existing Citibank customers are eligible for same-day funding. Plus, you can get in-person help with your application at a local branch.\n\nLower loan limits than other lenders\n\nMust be an existing Citibank customer\n\nCitibank doesn\u2019t chargeorigination feesor late fees, and its maximum advertised APR is low, keeping borrowing costs down. The autopay discount of 0.50% is higher than many other lenders offer (0.25% is typical). Citigold and Citi Priority customers can get an additional 0.25% rate discount.\n\nAnother perk for existing customers is same-day funding, which is sent directly to their Citibank account.\u00a0 In the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study, Citibank ranked third.\n\nWith all that in its favor, it\u2019s disappointing that Citibank now limits personal loan applications to existing customers.\n\nCitibank, founded in 1812, is the third-largest U.S. bank, with total assets exceeding $1.7 trillion, as of September 2024.It operates 648 branches in the U.S. In a $70 billion deal, Citicorp and Travelers Group merged in 1998 to form Citigroup.\n\nA local credit union is your best bet for an affordable personal loan. This is especially true if you want a loan under $1,000. We chose Lake Michigan Credit Union as the Best for Small Loan Amounts because its minimum of $250 is the lowest in our database of 59 lenders, but plenty of credit unions have minimums of $300 or $500.\n\nCredit life and disability insurance available\n\nOption to skip a monthly payment for $25\n\nWe chose LMCU as Best for Small Loans because of its $250 minimum. However, many credit unions offer loans under $1,000 and even under $500, so you have plenty of options.\n\nYou won\u2019t pay an origination fee on a loan from LMCU, and because it is a federal credit union, you won\u2019t pay more than 18% interest. If something unexpected happens, you can skip a monthly payment (for a $25 fee), up to twice a year. The minimum credit score of 650 means LMCU loans are available topeople with \u201cfair\u201d credit. You can also apply with a co-borrower.\n\nUnfortunately, LMCU does not offer pre-qualification; you must complete an application to see what rates and terms you are approved for. That means a slight negative hit to your credit score.And because it\u2019s a credit union, you need to become a member to borrow. If you don\u2019t meet LMCU\u2019s affiliate or regional qualifications, you can join by donating $5 to the ALS Foundation.\n\nLMCU was founded in 1933. Today it has over $14 billion in assets and more than 600,000 members. It\u2019s the largest financial institution headquartered in West Michigan.\n\nWith Navy Federal Credit Union, eligible service members and their families qualify for personal loans with no origination fees, low rates, and same-day funding. You can borrow up to $50,000, and if you\u2019re borrowing for a home improvement, you will have up to 180 months (15 years) to repay it.\n\nStrong customer-service ratings\n\nWide range of loan amounts and terms\n\nDoesn\u2019t offer pre-qualification\n\nNo online application for some loan types\n\nNavy Federal Credit Union\u2019s personal loans have a lot to offer. Borrowers can choose from a wide range of loan amounts and terms and rates start at 8.99% and won\u2019t exceed 18%. Plus, there are no origination fees. If you\u2019re borrowing at least $30,000 for a home improvement, you can take up to 180 months to pay it off. Just be aware that late payments will result in a $29 late payment fee.\n\nNavy Federal earned the second-highest score in the 2024 J.D. Power Consumer Lending Satisfaction Study and a Combined Consumer Review rating of 4.5 (out of 5).This rating, developed by Investopedia researchers, is an aggregate of consumer review ratings on two third-party review sites: Trustpilot and the Better Business Bureau.\n\nUnfortunately, only military service members, Department of Defense personnel, and their families can join. Another knock against Navy Federal is that it does not offerpre-qualification; you\u2019ll need to complete a loan application to learn the rates and terms you qualify for. Moreover, you\u2019ll need to join the credit union before you can begin an application.\n\nNavy Federal, founded in 1933 and headquartered in Vienna, Virginia, is the nation\u2019s largest credit union.\n\nWe\u2019ve already mentioned that a local credit union should be your first stop when shopping for a personal loan. Patelco Credit Union is the highest-scoring credit union in our rating model and it\u2019s no wonder why. It offers a broad range of loan amounts and terms, charges no origination fees, and offers pre-qualification and reasonable APRs.\n\nDiscount for consecutive on-time payments\n\nNumerous hardship repayment options\n\nDoes not report to all three credit bureaus\n\nPatelco Credit Union may not be a household name. Still, its broad range of personal loan options, competitive rates, customer support tools and resources, and enticing rate discounts are worth noticing. You can borrow as little as $300 and as much as $100,000. Repayment terms range from 6 months to 84 months. Patelco even offerscredit builder loansif you want to boost your credit score.\n\nPatelco offers two rate discounts. The first is a customer loyalty discount of 0.10% for members with several accounts that meet deposit or loan minimums. The second, a 0.50% reduction, rewards borrowers who make on-time payments for 12 consecutive months. This one can be earned three times for a rate discount of up to 1.50%. Patelco also offers payment protection insurance and several hardship programs if borrowers need more time to come up with a payment.\n\nMembership is easy. You\u2019re eligible if you live or work in a few northern California counties. If you don\u2019t, you can join the Financial Fitness Association (Patelco will cover the fee).\n\nPatelco Credit Union was founded in 1936 by Pacific Telephone & Telegraph Company employees. Its headquarters are in Dublin, California, and it has over $9 billion in assets and 450,000 members.\n\nInvestopedia collected thousands of data points from dozens of lenders to evaluate the factors most important for borrowers. We used this information to rank each lender based on APRs and fees, loan amounts, repayment terms, customer experience, and other factors to support our mission to provide unbiased, comprehensive reviews and help you make the right financial decisions. Investopedia launched in 1999 and has been researching and evaluating personal loan lenders since 2019.\n\nInvestopedia calculatesaverage monthly personal interest ratesby taking a four-week average of weekly personal loan rate data for 17 of the nation's largest personal loan providers. Advertised personal loan rates on lender websites are stated as a range of annual percentage rates (APRs) that lenders offer to borrowers of all credit quality ranges on their websites.\n\nBorrower credit score is a key factor in personal loan interest rates.\n\nApersonal loanis a type ofinstallment loanwhere borrowers receive a lump sum and then repay it in increments over a period of time. Personal loan amounts can range from a few hundred dollars to $100,000. The repayment terms may also vary: some can be paid off in a few months while others may be repaid over years.\n\nPersonal loans can be unsecured or secured, although most are unsecured.Secured loansrequire the borrower to providecollateralto back the loan ,while unsecured loans don\u2019t. Since unsecured loans don\u2019t require collateral, lenders typically determine the terms of your loan by evaluating your creditworthiness\u2014the higher yourcredit score, the more likely you are to receive favorable terms, including a lower APR.\u00a0 Lenders may also look at your annual income, credit history, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.\n\nTypically, the interest rate, orAnnual Percentage Rate (APR)on personal loans is fixed, which means it doesn\u2019t fluctuate.\n\nIf your credit score is low or your credit history is thin, you may not think you're eligible for a personal loan. However, some lenders specialize in loans for people with challenging credit. Learn more about them:Best Personal Loans for Bad CreditandBest Emergency Loans for Bad Credit.\n\nA personal loan is best for people who want flexibility in how they use their funds, prefer a lump-sum payment, and have a strong credit score.\n\nUnlike other types of debt, like anauto loanormortgage, a personal loan offers versatility: You can use the funds to pay off medical expenses, finance moving costs, purchase a big-ticket item, and more.\n\nWhile personal loans typically offer lower APRs than credit cards, borrowers need a solid credit score to qualify. Therefore, they may be a budget-friendly lending option for those who have strong credit scores and histories.\n\nUnsecured personal loans don\u2019t require collateral\n\nStrong credit required for lower APRs\n\nLack of continued access to credit\n\nA personal loan can help you cover an emergency expense, make a home improvement, or help you consolidate higher-cost debt, but it\u2019s not your only choice.\n\nWithcredit cards, cardholders receive a revolving line of credit up to a fixed credit limit and then make monthly payments to pay down their debt. Like personal loans, credit cards allow you to use money flexibly but often charge higher APRs. And since credit cards have variable APRs, the interest rate (plus fees) may fluctuate with changes in thefederal funds rate.\n\nSome credit cards offer rewards for the money you spend. Depending on the card, you may receive cash-back, rewards points, or miles on your everyday spending. However, if you\u2019re not diligent about paying off your balance on time and in full every month, the interest you pay on your credit card debt will exceed the value of the rewards you earn.\n\nCredit cards may not be right for everyone. Interest rates are high, especially if your credit score is fair or poor. If you carry a balance from month to month, interest costs can get expensive.\n\nIn contrast, personal loans generally have fixed interest rates, so your monthly payment is fixed. Andunlike credit cards, personal loans provide borrowers with a lump-sum\u2014if you need additional money, you\u2019d have to apply for another loan.\n\nGenerally, credit cards are a better choice if you\u2019re looking to finance everyday expenses, while a personal loan is a better choice if you want a lump-sum payment for debt consolidation or paying off a major expense. Whether you opt for a credit card or personal loan, they\u2019re both types of debt. Failing to make your payments in full and on time will hurt your credit score.\n\nAhome equity loanis a type of mortgage loan that allows you to borrow against the equity you have in your home. Like personal loans, home equity loans provide a lump sum of cash and have fixed interest rates and terms, meaning borrowers have fixed monthly payments.\n\nWhile home equity loans generally offer lower APRs than credit cards and personal loans, they can be risky. Since your home equity is considered collateral with a home equity loan, you could be atrisk of foreclosureif you can\u2019t pay it off. Plus, if the value of your home declines, you may end up paying more than your home is worth.\n\nOne upside of a home equity loan is that your interest payments can be tax-deductible if you use the funds to \u201cbuy, build, or substantially improve the residence,\u201d according to the IRS.\n\nAccording to our research,LightStreamis the best personal loan lender, based on its combination of competitive rates, large loan amounts, and wide range of repayment terms.\n\nIf you're looking to borrow from a traditional bank, our choice isCitibank. It offers a low maximum APR and same-day funding for Citibank account holders. If you live near a Citibank branch, you can get in-person assistance with your application.\n\nThe average personal loan borrower had a credit score of 685 during the final quarter of 2022, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nHowever, this can vary quite a bit; some lenders, such as Upstart, have no minimum credit score requirement. Others require a credit score over 700. Banks and credit unions tend to have highercredit score requirements. Fintech lenders generally accept lower credit scores.\n\nThe monthly cost of a personal loan, of whatever amount, will depend on the loan amount, the loan term (or the number of monthly payments), and the interest rate. The easiest way to calculate a monthly payment is to use apersonal loan calculator. A $5,000 loan, with no origination fees and repaid over 24 months (or two years), with an interest rate of 12.33% (the current average rate charged on two-year personal loans, according to the Federal Reserve) would result in a monthly payment of $236.14.Total interest cost would be $667.33.\n\nBased on our analysis of rates, terms, customer experience, and other factors, we encourage borrowers to check with a credit union while gathering loan offers. Credit unions generally offer better rates to a broader range of credit profiles than traditional banks or fintechs.However, credit unions may not be as convenient as banks or fintechs, due to credit union membership requirements. And few credit unions offer the streamlined application and approval processes that fintechs, and many banks, now offer.\n\nWe researched and reviewed 59 lenders to find the lenders you see above. Below are the lenders we researched to determine the best personal loan lenders, along with links to individual company reviews to help you learn more before making a decision:\n\nAchieve, Affinity Federal Credit Union,Alliant Credit Union,American Express,Avant, Axos,Best Egg, Bethpage Federal Credit Union, BHG Financial, Blaze Credit Union, Blue Federal Credit Union, Boeing Employees' Credit Union,Citibank, Connexus Credit Union,Discover, ENT Credit Union, Fig Loans,First Tech Federal Credit Union, Greenstate Credit Union, Happy Money,Lake Michigan Credit Union, Laurel Road,LendingClub, LendingPoint, LendingUSA, Liberty Federal Credit Union,LightStream, Mariner, Money Key, Mountain America Credit Union,NASA Federal Credit Union,Navy Federal Credit Union, Netcredit, Old National Bank,OneMain, OppLoans,Patelco Credit Union,PenFed, Personify Financial, PNC Bank,Prosper, Reach Financial, Regions, Reprise, Rocket Loans,Santander, Service Federal Credit Union,SoFi,Summit Credit Union,TD Bank, Teachers Federal Credit Union, Truist,U.S. Bank,Universal Credit,Upgrade,Upstart, USAA,Wells Fargo, Zable.\n\nInvestopedia collected more than 2,600 data points from 59 lenders, including traditional banks, credit unions, fintechs, and finance companies to evaluate and rank the best personal loan providers. We identified and collected 45 criteria, including APRs, loan amounts and terms, fees, customer experience, and more. Our criteria and ratings are also informed by speaking to hundreds of borrowers about their personal experiences with personal loan lenders and their views on the process. Research and data collection began on July 23 and concluded on October 18, 2024.\n\nWe organized the 45 criteria into four categories. We then scored and weighted 26 criteria to develop our overall star rating for each lender (1,500 data points in all), using the remaining criteria for background and editorial richness. The categories and their weights for this project are:\n\nTo maintain the integrity of the data following collection and analysis, Investopedia\u2019s compliance team monitors changes to key details, like interest rates and fees.
