  "term": "Nordic Model: Comparing the Economic System to the U.S.",
  "definition": "The Nordic model is the combination of social welfare and economic systems adopted by Nordic countries. It combines features of capitalism, such as amarket economyandeconomic efficiency, with social benefits, such as state pensions and\u00a0income distribution.\n\nThe Nordic model, also known as the Scandinavian model, is most commonly associated with the countries of Scandinavia: Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland.\n\nThe Nordic model embraces both thewelfare stateandglobalization\u2014two approaches to government that can be seen at times as opposites. The core aspects of the Nordic model include:\n\nThere isno minimum wagebecause unions ensure that wages remain high.\n\nTheNordic modelemphasizes society-wide risk sharing and the use of a social safety net to help workers and families adapt to changes in the overall economy brought on by increased global competition for goods and services. These Scandinavian economies have benefited from cultural homogeneity, political freedoms, and low levels of corruption.\n\nMuch of the model is based on how Nordic cultures have developed over the centuries. The citizens have a high degree of trust in their government and a history of working together to reach compromises and address societal challenges through democratic processes.\n\nCitizens believe that both public institutions and private companies have their best interests in mind through a general social contract, with an emphasis on fairness.\n\nMaintaining economic growth while providing social welfare services requires Nordic countries to emphasize workforce participation. Nordic governments have to create incentives for their citizens to continue to work despite having generous welfare benefits.\n\nThe finances of Nordic governments are generally considered strong, with economic growth steady. This was not always the case, as several Nordic countries struggled with low productivity and highunemploymentduring the 1990s.\n\nThe Nordic model is paid for by some of the highest tax rates in the world. In 2022 (the latest information), tax revenues as a percentage ofgross domestic product (GDP)were approximately 41.89% in Denmark, 44.30% in Norway, and 41.32% in Sweden, according to theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That compares\u00a0to the 27.66% of GDP raised by the United States through taxation in 2022, the most recent year for which such comparisons are available.\n\nAccording to PwC, Finland\u2019s top personal income tax rate in 2024 was 55%, Denmark\u2019s was 52.07%, and\u00a0Norway\u2019s was 47.4%. Tax rates in these countries are relatively high for nearly all income, not just that of wealthy people.\n\nBy comparison, the top tax bracket in the U.S. in 2024 was 37% and only levied on individuals who make $609,350 or more ($731,200 for married couples filing jointly).\n\nThe Nordic tax model features a high tax rate system, at least relative to the United States. This tax system funds a strong social safety net that provides universal healthcare, free education, extensive parental leave after pregnancy, child support, and more.\n\nThe Nordic model has been successful for many reasons. One is that it promotes a highly educated workforce, which leads to a high workforce participation rate, strengthening economic development. Many economic factors are the government\u2019s responsibility, paid for through high taxes, such as healthcare, higher education costs, and child support.\n\nWhile the Nordic model has been sustainable, it does face challenges. A larger older population and a smaller workforce create challenges in generating enough taxes needed to support the social services needed for the elderly and the rest of society.\n\nThe Nordic model is a blend of capitalism and socialism, which incorporates market efficiency and extensive social welfare. A key feature of this model is the high taxes that are needed to fund public services and strong labor protection.\n\nThe system builds trust in government and stresses fairness, society risk sharing, and high workforce participation. The Nordic system stands in contrast to the more dominant capitalist system in the U.S., which includes lower taxes and less social support.\n\nTorben M.
