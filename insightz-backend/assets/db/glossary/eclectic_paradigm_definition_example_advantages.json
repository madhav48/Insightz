  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nAn eclectic paradigm, also known as the ownership, location,internalization(OLI) model or OLI framework, is a three-tiered evaluation framework that companies can follow when attempting to determine if it is beneficial to pursueforeign direct\u00a0investment(FDI). This paradigm assumes that institutions will avoid transactions in theopen marketif the cost of completing the same actions internally, or in-house, carries a lower price. It is based on internalization theory and was first expounded upon in 1979 by the scholar John H. Dunning.\n\nThe eclectic paradigm takes a holistic approach\u00a0to examining entire relationships and interactions of the various components of a business. The paradigm\u00a0provides a strategy for\u00a0operation expansion\u00a0through FDI. The goal is to determine if a particular\u00a0approach provides greater\u00a0overall value than other available national or international choices for the production of goods or services.\n\nSince businesses seek the most cost-effective options while still maintaining\u00a0quality, they may use\u00a0the eclectic paradigm\u00a0to\u00a0evaluate\u00a0any scenario which exhibits potential.\n\nFor FDI\u00a0to be beneficial, the following advantages must be evident:\n\nThe first consideration,ownership advantages, include\u00a0proprietary information and variousownership rightsof a company. These may consist of branding, copyright, trademark or patent rights, plus the use and management of internally-available skills. Ownership advantages are typically considered to be intangible. They include that which gives a competitive advantage, such as a reputation for reliability.\n\nLocation advantageis the second necessary good. Companies must assess\u00a0whether there is a comparative advantage to performing specific functions within a particular nation. Often fixed in nature, these considerations apply to the availability and costs of resources, when functioning in one location compared to\u00a0another.Location advantagecan refer to natural or created resources, but either way, they are generally immobile, requiring a partnership with a foreign investor in that location to be utilized to full advantage.\n\nFinally,internalization advantages, signal when it is better for an organization to produce a particular product in-house, versus contracting with a third-party.\u00a0At times, it may be more cost-effective for an organization to operate from a different market location while they keep doing the work in-house. If the business decides tooutsourcethe production, it may require negotiating partnerships with local producers. However, taking an outsourcing route only makes financial sense if the contracting company\u00a0can meet the organization\u2019s needs and quality standards at a lower cost. Perhaps the foreign company can also offer a greater degree of local market knowledge, or even more skilled employees who can make a better product.\n\nAccording to Research Methodology, an independent research and analyst firm, the eclectic paradigm were applied byShanghai Vision Technology Company, in its decision to export its 3D printers and other innovative tech offerings. While their choice strongly considered the disadvantage of higher tariffs and transportation costs, theirinternationalization strategyultimately allowed them to flourish in new markets.",
