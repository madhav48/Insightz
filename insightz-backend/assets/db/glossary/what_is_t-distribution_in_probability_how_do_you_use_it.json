  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA t-distribution is a statistical tool used to estimate how likely different outcomes are when working with small samples and an unknown population standard deviation.\n\nT-distribution, also known as Student\u2019s t-distribution, is a statistical function that creates aprobability distribution.The t-distribution is similar to thenormal distribution, with its bell shape, but it has heavier tails.\n\nIt is used for estimating population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variances. T-distributions have a greater chance of extreme values than normal distributions, and as a result have fatter tails. The t-distribution is the basis for computingt-testsin statistics.\n\nTail heaviness is determined by a parameter of the t-distribution calleddegrees of freedom, with smaller values giving heavier tails, and with higher values making the t-distribution resemble a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and astandard deviationof 1.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02020\n\nWhen a sample of n observations is taken from a normally distributed population having mean M and standard deviation D, the sample mean, m, and the sample standard deviation, d, will differ from M and D because of the randomness of the sample.\n\nA z-score can be calculated with the population standard deviation as Z = (x \u2013 M)/D, and this value has the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nBut when using the estimated standard deviation, a t-score is calculated as T = (m \u2013 M)/{d/sqrt(n)}, and the difference between d and D makes the distribution a t-distribution with (n - 1) degrees of freedom rather than the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nTake the following example for how t-distributions are put to use in statistical analysis. First, remember that a confidence interval for the mean is a range of values, calculated from the data, meant to capture a \u201cpopulation\u201d mean. This interval is m +- t*d/sqrt(n), where t is a critical value from the t-distribution.\n\nFor instance, a 95% confidence interval for the mean return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the 27 trading days before Sept. 11, 2001, is -0.33%, (+/- 2.055) * 1.07 / sqrt(27), giving a (persistent) mean return as some number between -0.75% and +0.09%. The number 2.055, the amount of standard errors to adjust by, is found from the t-distribution.\n\nBecause the t-distribution has fatter tails than a normal distribution, it can be used as a model for financial returns that exhibit excesskurtosis, which will allow for a more realistic calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) in such cases.\n\nNormal distributions are used when the population distribution is assumed to be normal. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, just with fatter tails.\n\nBoth assume a normally distributed population. T-distributions thus have higher kurtosis than normal distributions. The probability of getting values very far from the mean is larger with a t-distribution than a normal distribution.\n\nThe t-distribution can skew exactness relative to the normal distribution. Its shortcoming only arises when there\u2019s a need for perfect normality.\n\nThe t-distribution should only be used when the population standard deviation is not known. If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large enough, the normal distribution should be used for better results.\n\nA t-distribution is a probability distribution similar to a normal distribution except that it gives more weight to extreme outcomes, which is why it has heavier tails, reflecting greater uncertainty due to small sample sizes. It helps predict how likely certain outcomes are when only a limited amount of data is available.\n\nSo, when you want to know how close your sample results are to what's true for the whole group, a t-distribution will give you a better estimate than a normal distribution. This is important in scenarios where being off by just a little can have drastic consequences, such as scientific studies.\n\nThe t-distribution is used in statistics to estimate the population parameters for small sample sizes or undetermined variances. It is also referred to as the Student\u2019s t-distribution.\n\nThe t-distribution should be used if the population sample size is small and the standard deviation is unknown. If not, then the normal distribution should be used.\n\nNormal distribution is a term for a probability bell curve. It is also called theGaussian distribution.\n\nThe t-distribution is used in statistics to estimate the significance of population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variations. Like the normal distribution, it is bell-shaped and symmetric. Unlike normal distributions, it has heavier tails, which result in a greater chance for extreme values.\n\nBarbara Illowsky and Susan Dean. \u201cIntroductory Statistics,\u201d Pages 443-447.
