  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nReference numbers commonly include random numbers or letters assigned to financial transactions.\n\nThe reference number is created technologically for a single transaction when a consumer uses a credit ordebit card. A reference number helps an institution identify transactions in records and electronic databases used to monitor transactions. Reference numbers are included on a cardholder\u2019smonthly statement.\n\nReference numbers are used byfinancial institutionsto make compiling and queries of millions of transactions easier to manage. They are generated once a transaction is completed and are made up of a combination of random letters and numbers. Reference numbers are generally assigned to transactions such as certain deposits and withdrawals, bank transfers, wire transfers, and bill payments.\n\nThese numbers are used in both printed statements andonline bankingstatements that a cardholder can access at any time. Credit card statements provide a summary of all of the transactions a cardholder makes during a given period. Regulations require card companies to provide cardholders with instructions concerning the contents of the statement, as well as how to read and understand the different sections.\n\nSome companies may use the term file number when referring to a reference number.\n\nReference numbers make it easier for customers to interact with customer service representatives. Consumers can report questionable transactions to the representative, who can then investigate them through their database to obtain more details about the transactions. For example, a customer may simply reference \u201ctransaction 123456\u201d instead of using the store and date of the transaction. The descriptive elements of the transaction are maintained in the transaction metadata in the card company\u2019s database.\n\nEach transaction\u2019s reference number provides a valuable identifier to help make the resolution process much faster for all transaction queries and any fraudulent charges. Card companies can track comprehensive information about a transaction by its reference number. With the reference number, the company can identify the merchant or seller, as well as the card terminal or terminal owner that was used to execute the transaction.\n\nIf a card has been compromised or used for fraudulent purposes, card companies can void the charges by using the reference number in the pending phase.\n\nIn some cases, customer service inquiries and calls may also generate a reference number. For example, if a customer calls to inquire about a product or service, the customer service representative may give that consumer a reference number to quote if they call back at a future date to complete the transaction. Reference numbers also provide operational transaction details for merchants. Merchants can use reference numbers to identify and track every transaction made by their business.\n\nReference numbers may also be assigned to a credit card orloan application. The location of the reference number, in this case, varies depending on the issuer or provider. Typically, it\u2019s at the end of an application form or provided in an email or letter from the company. Most reference numbers will be found at the top of the application submission form, which shows up after applying. It\u2019s also usually quoted at the top of a follow-up email or letter from the company. Many companies provide reference numbers for credit cards or loans, while some do not.\n\nA booking reference number is used by airlines, hotels, travel agents, and online travel companies. These unique codes are specific to an individual travel reservation. These codes are also called confirmation numbers and show up on airline tickets and hotel reservation systems. If a customer wishes to change or cancel a reservation, the booking reference number will help the customer service representative identify the reservation details in the system.\n\nA United Parcel Service reference number is also called a UPS pickup reference number. One or more parties to the shipment will use this series of characters or numbers to help UPS Freight correctly identify the shipment. The carrier can designate the reference number from various sources, including the return authorization number.\n\nWhile many customers will track a FedEx package with a tracking number, a reference number provides an alternative way for customers to locate their packages. Examples of a FedEx reference number include a purchase order (PO) number, customer account number, invoice number, andbill of ladingnumber. Having access to one or more of these numbers helps customers track the status of their shipment and verify delivery.\n\nBanks use federal reference numbers to trackwire transfersof money. The receipt for the wire transfer will include a section labeled \"Fed Reference\" or \"Federal Reference.\" This is where you will find a unique series of numbers that you can use to investigate and track the electronic wire transfer from the initiating bank to the receiving bank.\n\nFinancial institutions use reference numbers to identify transactions and make compiling and querying transactions easier to manage. Reference numbers are generated when a transaction is completed and commonly include a combination of random letters and numbers.\n\nUPS. \"Glossary.\" Accessed Dec. 6, 2021.\n\nFedEx. \"Tracking.\" Accessed Dec. 6, 2021.",
