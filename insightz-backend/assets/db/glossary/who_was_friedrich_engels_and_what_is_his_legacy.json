Known for his collaboration withKarl Marx, Friedrich Engels helped define moderncommunism. Friedrich Engels is the co-author ofThe Communist Manifesto, an 1848 pamphlet regarded as one of the world's most influential political documents. Engels died on Aug. 5, 1895, in London, England.\n\nFriedrich Engels was born\u00a0on Nov. 20, 1820, in Barmen, Prussia, today's Germany. He was the eldest son of a wealthy textile manufacturer. At age 17, Engels traveled to Manchester, England, to learn the family business at the Ermen & Engels cotton plant.\n\nAlthough raised in a family environment of moderate political views, and steadfast loyalty to\u00a0Prussia and the Protestant\u00a0faith, Friedrich Engels developed a sense of cynicism toward major institutions like religion andcapitalism. His ideology would later become a theme of his publications.\n\nAfter his apprenticeship in Manchester, Friedrich Engels worked in the export trade business and lived in the\u00a0city of Bremen, Prussia from\u00a01838 to 1841.\n\n\"The Bremen years\" marked the start of his career in journalism, politics, and economics where he wrote under the pseudonym of\u00a0Friedrich Oswald. He was involved in social reform and the literary movement of a young Germany. For three years in Bremen, Friedrich Engels lived a double life, one as a merchant\u2019s clerk, and that of an anonymous journalist, commentator, and intellectual.\n\nPassionate about education, Engels reportedly boasted to his sister that he knew 24 languages.\n\nIn 1841, Engels enlisted as a volunteer for one year in an artillery regiment in Berlin. While in the city, he attended lectures at the university and his \"Friedrich Oswald\" articles gained him entry into the Young Hegelian circle of The Free, a club frequented by Karl Marx.\n\nThe Young or Left Hegelians were considered radical followers of\u00a0Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German idealist,\u00a0between the late 1830s and the mid-1840s. They flourished between the French Revolution in 1830, and a wave of revolutions that swept Europe in 1848.\n\nThe Young Hegelians were both the product and the producers of the potent mixture of religion, philosophy, and politics that fermented in Germany during that period. Karl Marx and\u00a0Friedrich Engels would become leaders of this revolutionary group.\n\nLife as a Young Hegelian at Berlin University, and time spent at his family mill in Manchester, England, strengthened Engels' skeptical view of capitalism. His support ofsocialism, where resources and means of production are commonly or publicly owned to create a more equal society, grew.\n\nAfter witnessing the uneven distribution of wealth gained during theIndustrial Revolutionin Manchester, Engels recalled \u201cwomen made unfit for childbearing, children deformed, men enfeebled, limbs crushed, whole generations wrecked, afflicted with disease and infirmity, purely to fill the purses of thebourgeoisie,\" in his 1845 book,The Condition of the Working Class in England.\n\nHe noted that urban planning, how city space was socially and economically constructed, to support capitalism at the time, was an arena ripe for class conflict and revolution.\n\nEngels believed that capitalism created and maintained class struggles between the bourgeoisie, the business owners, and the proletariat, the working class. Marx's theory, orMarxism, represented the recognition of this imbalance and defined ideas to create a political and economic landscape without class structure.\n\nThe Communist Manifesto, published in 1848, represents the converging ideas of Freidrich Engels and Karl Marx and formed the basis for the modern communist movement. Written at a time of industrial and social change, cities were expanding, with large proportions of the population moving from the countryside to urban areas to find employment. Economic growth was dependent on this workforce, often exploited by employers. Engels and Marx argued that a series of class struggles would destroy capitalism, and be replaced by socialism, followed by communism.\n\nThe document encouraged revolution and its ideas reverberated with increasing force into the 20th century. By 1950, nearly half the world\u2019s population lived under Marxist governments.\n\nKarl Marx published the first volume ofDas Kapitalin 1867, in London, with financial support from Friedrich Engels. Translated asCapital: A Critique of Political Economy, the book argues that the motivating force of capitalism is in the exploitation of labor, and Marx wanted to create a theoretical foundation for the overthrow of capitalism.\n\nFriedrich Engels worked with Karl Marks to lay the groundwork for the practice of communism, where people live in social equilibrium, without class distinction, family structure, religion, or property. Their published works includeThe Condition of the Working Class in England, The Communist Manifesto, The Holy Family,andDas Kapital.\n\nAfter Karl Marx died in 1883, Engels served as the foremost authority on Marx and completed two edits ofDas Kapital.He also wroteSocialism: Utopian and Scientificin 1880,The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the Statein 1884,andLudwig Feuerbach and the Outcome of Classical German Philosophyin 1888.\n\nFor the remainder of his life, Friedrich Engels corresponded extensively with German social democrats, perpetuating the image of Marx and fostering a degree of conformity among followers of their philosophy.\n\nThe book recounts Engels' experience while working in Manchester, England, recalling the use of child labor, environmental damage, low wages, bad conditions, poor health, and the high death rates among laborers.\n\nThirty literary works that were published under Engels' pseudonym were found in Bremen after Engels' passing and are preserved. His pseudonym was not revealed until after his death.\n\nContrary to Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, who both believed in necessary revolution, utopian socialists believed that capitalists could be encouraged to surrender the means of production peacefully to the people through moral persuasion alone.\n\nFriedrich Engels is remembered as a staunch advocate for communism and social change during the 19th century. Together with Karl Marx, Engels' books and publications have influenced societies worldwide, most notably, the former Soviet Union, Cuba, and China.\n\nBrittanica. \"Friedrich Engels.\"\n\nBremen Tourism. \"Friedrich Engels.\"\n\nEncyclopedia. \"Young Hegelians.\"\n\nMarxists.org. \"What Is Socialism?\"\n\nThe Guardian. \"Engels Comes of Age: The Socialist Who Wanted a Joyous Life for Everyone.\"\n\nBrittanica. \"Friedrich Engels Partnership With Marx.\"\n\nHistory. \"Karl Marx Publishes the Communist Manifesto.\"\n\nEncyclopedia. \"Utopian Socialism.\"",
