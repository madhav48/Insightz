  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nData smoothing is done by using an algorithm to removenoisefrom a data set. This allows important patterns to more clearly stand out.\n\nData smoothing can be used to help predict trends, such as those found in securities prices, as well as in economic analysis. Data smoothing is intended to ignore one-time outliers and take into account the effects of seasonality.\n\nWhen data is compiled, it can be manipulated to remove or reduce anyvolatility, or any other type of noise. This is called data smoothing.\n\nThe idea behind data smoothing is that it can identify simplified changes in order to help predict different trends and patterns. It acts as an aid for statisticians or traders who need to look at a lot of data\u2014that can often be complicated to digest\u2014to find patterns they would not otherwise see.\n\nTo explain with a visual representation, imagine a one-year chart for Company X's stock. Each individual high point on the chart for the stock can be reduced while raising all the lower points. This would make a smoother curve, thus helping an investor make predictions about how the stock may perform in the future.\n\nSmoothed data is generally preferred by economists because it better identifies changes in trends compared to unsmoothed data, which may appear more erratic and create false signals.\n\nThere are different methods in which data smoothing can be done. Some of these include the randomization method, using arandom walk, calculating amoving average, or conducting one of several exponential smoothing techniques.\n\nAsimple moving average(SMA) places equal weight on both recent prices and historical ones, while anexponential moving average(EMA) puts more weight on recent price data.\n\nThe random walk model is commonly used to describe the behavior of financial instruments, such as stocks. Some investors believe that there is no relationship between past movement in a security's price and its future movement. Random walk smoothing assumes that future data points will equal the last available data point, plus a random variable. Technical and fundamental analysts disagree with this idea; they believe future movements can be extrapolated by examining past trends.\n\nOften used intechnical analysis, the moving average smooths out price action while it filters out volatility from random price movements. This process is based on past prices, making it a trend-following\u2014or\u00a0lagging\u2014indicator. As can be seen in the price chart below, the moving average (EMA) has the general shape and trend of the underlying daily price data, depicted by the candlesticks. The more days incorporated into the moving average, the more smoothed the line becomes.\n\nData smoothing can be used to help identify trends in the economy, in securities, such as stocks, and consumer sentiment. Data smoothing can also be used for other business purposes.\n\nFor example, an economist can smooth out data to makeseasonal adjustmentsfor certain indicators, like retail sales, by reducing the variations that may occur each month, like holidays or gas prices.\n\nThere are downfalls to using this tool, however. Data smoothing doesn't always provide an explanation of the trends or patterns it helps identify. It also may lead to certain data points being ignored by emphasizing others.\n\nHelps identify real trends by eliminating noise from the data\n\nAllows for seasonal adjustments of economic data\n\nEasily achieved through several techniques including moving averages\n\nRemoving data always comes with less information to analyze, increasing the risk of errors in analysis\n\nSmoothing may emphasize analysts' biases and ignore outliers that may be meaningful\n\nAn often-cited example of data smoothing in business accounting is to make anallowance for doubtful accountsby changingbad debt expensefrom one reporting period to another. For example, a company expects not to receive payment for certain goods over two accounting periods; $1,000 in the first reporting period and $5,000 in the second reporting period.\n\nIf the first reporting period is expected to have a high income, the company may include the total amount of $6,000 as the allowance for doubtful accounts in that reporting period. This would increase the bad debt expense on the income statement by $6,000 and reduce net income by $6,000. This would thereby smooth out a high-income period by reducing income. It's important for companies to use judgment and legal accounting methods when adjusting any accounts.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
