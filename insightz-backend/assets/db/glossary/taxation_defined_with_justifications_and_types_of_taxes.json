  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nTaxation is a term for when a taxing authority, usually a government, levies or imposes\u00a0a financial obligation on its citizens or residents.\u00a0Paying taxes to governments or officials has been a mainstay of civilization since ancient times.\n\nThe term \"taxation\" applies to all types of mandatory levies, from income to capital gains toestate taxes. Though taxation can be a noun or verb, it is usually referred to as an act; the resulting revenue is usually called \"taxes.\"\n\nTaxation is differentiated from other forms of payment, such as market exchanges, in that taxation does not require consent and is not directly tied to any services rendered. The government compels taxation through an implicit or explicit threat of force. Taxation is legally different than extortion or a protectionracketbecause the imposing institution is a government, not private actors.\n\nTax systems have varied considerably across jurisdictions and time. In most modern systems, taxation occurs on both physicalassets, such as property and specific events, such as a sales transaction. The formulation of tax policies is one of the most critical and contentious issues in modern politics.\n\nThe U.S. government was originally funded on very little direct taxation. Instead, federal agencies assesseduser feesfor ports and other government property. In times of need, the government would decide to sell government assets andbondsor issue an assessment to the states for services rendered. In fact, Thomas Jefferson abolished direct taxation in 1802 after winning the presidency; onlyexcise taxesremained, which Congress repealed in 1817. Between 1817 and 1861, the federal government collected no internal revenue.\n\nAn income tax of 3% was levied on high-income earners during the Civil War. It was not until the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913 that the federal government assessed taxes on income as a regular revenue item.As of 2024, U.S. taxation applies to a wide range of items or activities, from income to cigarette and gasoline purchases to inheritances and when winning at a casino or even Nobel Prize.\n\nThe most basic function of taxation is to fund government expenditures. Varying justifications and explanations for taxes have been offered throughout history. Early taxes were used to support the ruling classes, raise armies, and build defenses. Often, the authority to tax stemmed from divine or supranational rights.\n\nLater justifications have been offered across utilitarian, economic, or moral considerations. Proponents ofprogressive levels of taxationon high-income earners argue that taxes encourage a more equitable society. Higher taxes on specific products and services, such as tobacco or gasoline, have been justified as a deterrent to consumption. Advocates of public goods theory argue taxes may be necessary in cases in which the private provision of public goods is considered sub-optimal, such as with lighthouses or national defense.\n\nAs mentioned above, taxation applies to all different types of levies. These can include (but are not limited to):\n\nThere is an old saying that goes \"the only sure things in life are death and taxes.\" Taxation has been a feature of society going back to ancient times. The role of taxes is to help governments fund various undertakings such as public works, infrastructure, and wars. Today, taxpayer dollars are still used for a variety of similar purposes.\n\nAs of 2024, the top 10 countries with the highest marginal income taxes are:\n\nOnly a handful of countries have 0% income tax. These include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands. Many of these are Arab oil-producing nations that subsidize their budgets with exports rather than taxes. These nations also feature relatively high sales taxes and/or corporate tax rates.\n\nNational Archives. \"Records of the Internal Revenue Service [IRS].\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Historical Highlights of the IRS.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"How High are Gas Taxes in Your State?\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Compare Tobacco Tax Data in Your State.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525, Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\" Pages 3, 34-36.\n\nTax Foundation. \"The Three Basic Tax Types.\"\n\nWorld Population Review. \"Highest Taxed Countries 2024.\"",
