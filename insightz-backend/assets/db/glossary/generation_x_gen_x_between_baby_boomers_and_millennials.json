  "term": "Generation X (Gen X): Between Baby Boomers and Millennials",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nGeneration X, sometimes shortened to\u00a0Gen X, is the name given to the generation of people born between the mid-1960s\u00a0and the early 1980s.\n\nThe exact years that comprise Gen X vary. Some researchers\u2014demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe, for example\u2014place the exact birth years from\u00a01961 to 1981, whereas Gallup places the birth years between\u00a01965 and 1979. But all agree that Gen X follows the baby boomer generation and precedes Generation Y,\u00a0also known as the millennial generation.\n\nThe name \"Generation X\" comes from a novel by Douglas Coupland, \"Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture\", published in 1991. Though it's more useful for marketing than\u00a0sociology, generational theory\u2014the assumption that people born within the same time frame can be considered a group with similar views, values, tastes, and habits\u2014and the idea of ageneration gaphave gained broad acceptance in the U.S.\n\nThe generations covered in the theory are:\n\nGen X numbers around 65 million, while the baby boomers have around 69 million members and millennials number around 72 million, as of the latest data from 2022. Gen X is also sometimes referred to as the \u201clatchkey generation\u201d as they were often left unsupervised at home after school until their parents came home from work.\n\nLike the silent generation, Generation X has been defined as an \"in-between\" generation. The group's earning power and savings were compromised first by thedotcom bust, and then by thefinancial crisis of 2008and theGreat Recession. In terms of social and political power, Generation X is sandwiched between the baby boomers, who came of age during the Vietnam and Reagan eras, and the millennials of the Obama era.\n\nGen X overlaps with another group called thesandwich generation. Each modern generation has gotten its time in this slot, which is used to characterize middle-aged individuals\u00a0who\u2014due to longer life spans and having children later in life\u2014find themselves supporting both aging parents and growing children simultaneously.\n\nThe 23rd Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey of Workers, published in 2023, comparesGen X, baby boomers, and millennials.Among its findings:\n\nOver the next two decades, there will be a major transfer of wealth\u2014collectively, around $84 trillion\u2014from baby boomers to younger generations including their Gen X children. And they'regoing to need it.\n\nGen X accounts for just 25.6% of the nation\u2019s wealth, while baby boomers hold just over half (51.6%), according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve.\n\nNotable members of Generation X include Jeff Bezos, Tiger Woods, and the late Kurt Cobain.\n\nThirty-one percent of Gen X members have at least $250,000 in household retirement savings, while 26% have between $50,000 and $250,000. By comparison, 51% of baby boomers have $250,000 or more saved for retirement. Nine percent of Gen X members have no money saved for retirement at all.\n\nJust 17% of Gen X workers feel \"very\" confident that they will be able to fully retire with a comfortable lifestyle, and 80% are concerned Social Security will not be there for them at retirement age. Forty percent plan to retire at age 70 or above, or do not expect to retire at all.\n\nOn average, Gen X households began working, saving, and investing during a period of lower investment returns than the baby boomers. Many Gen X households began building their savings in periods of high market valuations, such as thetechnology bubbleand dotcom bubble\u00a0of the late 1990s and in the run-up to the global financial crisis of 2008. The effects of the ensuingbear marketsstill weigh heavily on their portfolios.\n\nAdditionally, Gen X-ers have experienced an especially low-interest-rate environment\u00a0which has had an adverse impact on their ability to increase the value of their financial assets. Meanwhile, the early experiences of Gen X investors with major market declines seem to have made them morerisk-averse.\n\nGen X-ers' relatively lower levels of wealth, and the rising costs of education, healthcare, and property, will make it difficult for them to maintain their parents' consumption patterns.\u00a0And then there's the sandwich syndrome\u2014the fact that this generation has reached the age when they are supporting and educating children while alsoproviding care for aging parents.\n\nGen X-ers now have the highest average debt of any generation. According to research by Experian, average total debt reached $157,556 in the third quarter of 2023. Mortgage debt, HELOC loans, student loans, car loans, personal loans, and credit card debt all factored into average Gen X debt.\n\nThe retirement landscape is different for Gen X than for their parents. Once common, pension plans in the private sectorare rare and have been replacedby defined-contribution plans, such as a 401(k). And Gen Xers aren\u2019t counting on Social Security to fund their retirement either.\n\nBaby boomers (40%) are muchmore likely to expect Social Securityto be their primarysource of retirement income, compared with just 25% of Gen X, according to the Transamerica survey. In fact, 39% of Gen X \"strongly agree\" that Social Security might not be around when they retire, while 23% of baby boomers feel the same.\u201d\n\nThepotential for financial duresscan be substantial, butsteps can be takento reduce stress, balance budgets, and mitigate the effects of unplanned life events. Here are some recommendations for Gen X to get theirfinancial lives in orderand deal with all layers of that generational sandwich: Children, parents, and themselves.\n\nThis is vitally important if you have dependent children anddo not yet have a willor other necessary documents. You do not want the fate of your dependents or your belongings to be decided by a judge inprobatecourt. So, now is the time to make an appointment with anestate planningattorney to get your will, living will, medical, and durable powers of attorney\u2014and perhaps a living trust\u2014created\u00a0to ensure the smooth and quick transference of all of your dependents, possessions, and responsibilities to your heirs.\n\nAnd because estate settlement can be an emotionally delicate process,doing this nowcan allow you and your family to think through how this should be done from a calm, logical perspective.\n\nWhen you were in your 20s, managing your finances was a fairly simple matter of getting into good financial habits, such as saving and budgeting. Now you are at the point where your finances are probably a bit more complicated and one financial variable, such as the amount that you contribute to your company\u2019s 401(k) plan, can affect several other areas in ways that are becoming difficult to compute or predict with any accuracy.\n\nThis variable impact probably means that it is time to enlist a professional financial planner or financial advisor who can plug your cash flow, balance sheet, risk tolerance, investment objectives, time horizon, and tax bracket into a sophisticatedfinancial planning program.\n\nThis can give you at least some idea of where you really are financially and what you need to do going forward\u00a0to get\u00a0where you want to be by retirement age. Just be prepared to see some unpleasant numbers at the end, numbers that may indicate that you will not beable to retireas soon as you hoped.\n\nIf your debt load has become unmanageable, find a legitimate debt-management firm to help you get it under control.\n\nAlthough most experts warn parents about diverting retirement savings into their kids\u2019 college funds, this is\u00a0the time to open aCoverdell Education Savings Accountor a529 planfund if none exists.\n\nYour kids can contribute to these funds as well as you.The money you inheritfrom deceased parents or other relatives can also be college-funding sources. Opening an individual retirement account for them can be another good choice, as long as you\u2019re confident that they will not withdraw the contributions for other purposes.\n\nGranted, conversations about money between parents and their children can be awkward. But if you have not spoken with your parents about the state of their health and finances, then it\u2019s probably time to get the ball rolling in this area. If your parents' health is failing and they have no estate plan in place, then it may be wise to fork over the cash yourself to pay to\u00a0have this done if they consent.\n\nConsultan elder law attorneyfor advice if you need help dealing with managed-care issues and choose a designated sibling to be the point person for dealing with these matters.\n\nA common mistake the children of aging parents make is the overestimation of Medicare, Medigap, and Medicaid coverage. Having an understanding of what needs to be paid for\u00a0out-of-pocket can determine if purchasinglong-term care insurance(if that's still feasible) and supplemental insurance policies may be beneficial.\n\nThe pressure of caring for aging parents can be multiplied by the expense of supporting grown children. Requiring offspring who return home after college to help with household expenses\u2014 including paying rent, buying groceries, or assisting with the elders' care\u2014can relieve some of the pressure associated with supporting multiple generations. It can also provide children with some life lessons infinancial and fiscal responsibility.\n\nAlso known as the \"lost generation,\" \"forgotten generation,\" or \"invisible generation,\" Gen X has received these monikers because of the shifting societal values that occurred during their rise. Gen X grew up amid a rise in divorces, single-parent households, and loneliness. Today, Gen X is again considered \u201clost\u201d because it is stuck between the baby boomers and the millennials.\n\nGen X is older than Gen Z by a few decades. In between Gen X and Gen Z is the millennial generation.\n\nThe letter \"X\" refers to an unknown variable (as in mathematics), or to the generation's desire not to be defined.\n\nNumbering about 65 million, Generation X includes individuals born between the mid-1960s and the early 1980s. Known as the \"latchkey\" or the \"lost\" generation, Gen X-ers grew up at a time when societal values shifted, with many children home alone after school and an increase in divorce rates.\n\nTheir early years in the workforce included many economic hurdles, such as the dotcom bubble and the Great Recession. Today, Gen X members are in their prime earning years, but many stillfeel unprepared for retirement.\n\nGallup. \u201cWellbeing by Generation: Where Some Thrive, Others Struggle.\u201d\n\nWilliam Strauss and Neil Howe. \"Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069.\" Page 317.
