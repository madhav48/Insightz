  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatie Miller is a consumer financial services expert. She worked for almost two decades as an executive, leading multi-billion dollar mortgage, credit card, and savings portfolios with operations worldwide and a unique focus on the consumer. Her mortgage expertise was honed post-2008 crisis as she implemented the significant changes resulting from Dodd-Frank required regulations.\n\nThe graduate management admission test (GMAT) is a standardized test used to measure a test taker's aptitude in mathematics, verbal skills, and analytical writing. The GMAT is most commonly used as the primary exam reviewed by business schools to gain entrance into an MBA program. The exam is generally offered by computer only; in areas of the world where computer networks are limited, the exam may be given as a paper-based test.\n\nThe GMAT exam consists of four sections: analytical writing assessment, verbal reasoning, integrated reasoning, and quantitative reasoning.The maximum score achievable for the GMAT is 800, and exam scores are generally valid for five years following the exam's completion.On average, the exam takes three and one-half hours to complete.\n\nEvery year, over 255,000 individuals take the GMAT.As of August 2023, it costs $275 to take the test at a test center and $300 to take it online in the U.S.Due to the widespread nature of the admissions test, GMATs are offered almost every day of the year and can be taken every 16 calendar days. However, the test can be taken no more than eight times total and no more than five times in a 12-month period.Most applicants take the exam once or twice before applying.\n\nThe Graduate Management Admission Council administers the exam. In addition to testing comprehension of writing and math, the GMAT is also used to assess an individual\u2019s critical reasoning skills and logic as applicable to business and management in the real world.\n\nStarting in 2012, the exam added a section called Integrated Reasoning, which assesses an individual\u2019s evaluation skills for dealing with information gathered from multiple sources and in new formats. This section also intends to test students in the context of working with data and technology.\n\nApproximately 3,391 graduate programs and institutions around the world use the GMAT to assess applicants to their programs. The Graduate Management Admission Council has recommended that the GMAT be used as one factor for determining whether a student is accepted into a program.\n\nThe council cautions that for some international students, the writing analysis section might show the limits of their English language comprehension rather than their critical thinking and reasoning capacity.\n\nMoreover, the nature of the exams and what they test the applicants on make it inappropriate to treat both exams similarly.\u00a0The Graduate Management Admission Council recommends not using a so-called cutoff score when reviewing applicants but instead looking at their applications holistically. If a cutoff score is implemented, the council suggests the institution take additional measures to show that the cutoff does not lead to discrimination based on age, sex, or ethnicity.\n\nThe Graduate Management Admissions Council requires identification to take the test, which can include:\n\nAcceptable identification varies by country, so you should check the GMAC's website to learn what is acceptable in your country. In addition to having proper identification, you should be eligible to apply for a graduate program at the school you wish to attend.\n\nCompared to the GMAT's four, the GRE has three sections: an Analytical Writing Assessment, a Quantitative section, and a Verbal section. You're given three hours and 45 minutes to finish the test, the maximum score you can achieve is 170, and the average test score is 150.8.\n\nIt is not uncommon for graduate programs to use either the GMAT or theGraduate Record Examination(GRE) to assess an applicant. Due to the differences in how the two tests are scaled,GMAT and GREscores cannot be directly compared. However, some schools accept either the GMAT or the GRE, depending on the program you're applying for. Many graduate programs use the GRE, while more business graduate programs use the GMAT.\n\nThe GMAT requires that you have the critical thinking and reasoning skills required of business leaders. You might need to study and prepare for the test, or you might not\u2014whether it is hard depends on your experiences, knowledge, and level of preparation.\n\nThe maximum score on the GMAT is 800; the average score in 2022 was 651. So, a score of 700 is above average, but the closer you get to 800, the better it is for your application.\n\nIt depends on the college you're applying to and the program you wish to study. Colleges might prefer the GMAT over the GRE if you're interested in business. However, it's up to the specific college you're applying to whether it accepts the GRE or GMAT for your area of interest.\n\nThe GMAT is a test designed to evaluate your ability to think critically and make decisions using math, analytical, and communication skills. It is accepted at most business schools and isone of the first steps to take if you're considering a graduate degree in business.\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"GMAT Exam Structure.\"\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"How Is the GMAT Exam Scored?\"\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"GMAT Geographic Trend Report: Testing Year 2022,\" Page 24.\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"Exam Payment.\"\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"Frequently Asked Questions.\"\n\nGraduate Management Admissions Council. \"Structure and Content.\"\n\nGraduate Management Admission Council. \"Identification Requirements.\"\n\nPrinceton Review. \"About the GRE Test.\"",
