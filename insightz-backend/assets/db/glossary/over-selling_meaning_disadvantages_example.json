  "term": "Over-Selling: Meaning, Disadvantages, Example",
  "definition": "Over-selling occurs when a salesperson continues their sales pitch after the customer has already decided to make a purchase. This mistake can sometimes annoy the customer and could potentially cause the customer to change their mind, resulting in the deal falling through. Over-selling also means trying toupsella customer on more than they need or want; this may also have the effect of making the customer unconformable.\n\nOver-selling may be an effort to convince a customer that an extra item would enhance what they are looking to buy, or that a more expensive version might be a better option.\n\nOver-selling is most common in retail outlets where associates work on acommissionbasis or through sales-linked\u00a0bonuses. The salesperson has an\u00a0incentive\u00a0to sell as much as possible, regardless of the customers' needs.\n\nCar dealerships are often accused of over-selling. Their sales associates sometimes fail to recognize that they can generate significantly more revenue through return customers and referrals than they can by misleading customers into paying for extras that they neither need nor want. Some associates at car dealerships are willing to sacrifice long-term brand equity for short-term sales by selling customers on anything and everything.\n\nAlthough it may be done with good intentions, over-selling usually does more harm than good. Great salespeople know when the customer is ready to buy and, thus, when they should close the sale.\n\nOver-selling can have a negative impact on a company\u2019sbottom line. This is because it can raise doubts in the mind of a buyer, often\u00a0at the precise moment when the customer is\u00a0looking for a reason to believe that they are making the right choice. Raising this doubt in the customer's mind, because they no longer trust the salesperson, could blow the sale.\n\nOver-selling gives a buyer a reason to pause and ask themselves if they are paying too much, or if the\u00a0item\u00a0is more than what they\u00a0need.\u00a0Even if the buyer doesn't backpedal in an over-sell situation, the salesperson risks\u00a0creating false expectations that can never be met, in which case they could be damaging their credibility as a trusted salesperson.\n\nThere are reasons to believe that the pitfalls associated with over-selling have become worse over time. This is because buyers are becoming increasingly more informed and better educated; with virtually unlimited access\u00a0to information and alternatives on the Internet, buyers\u00a0have likely done their share of research beforehand and may have even made up their mind before ever\u00a0speaking with a sales professional.\n\nThis access to information has changed the sales dynamic; sales representatives are no longer\u00a0a consumer\u2019s only source of information. Often, salespeople would benefit from\u00a0asoft-sellapproach, or through presenting\u00a0various options\u00a0to customers. Need-based selling, oradaptive selling, is usually a preferable alternative to over-selling.\n\nSuppose there is a college student without a lot of money. They need a used, cheap, and reliable car for getting to and from a part-time job. They only have $1,500 to spend on the car and they tell the salesperson this upfront.\n\nImmediately the salesperson starts showing them cars priced at $5,000 to $10,000, telling the student they can get \"...easy financing to afford these much better cars.\" The student, who already has a bunch ofstudent loansdoesn't like the idea of taking on more debt. They relay this information to the salesperson, who continues to talk about how the low the interest rate is, and how filling out the forms will only take a few minutes.\n\nThe student, uncomfortable with the overselling, leaves and goes to another dealership or to another salesperson who will show them what they are asking for.",
