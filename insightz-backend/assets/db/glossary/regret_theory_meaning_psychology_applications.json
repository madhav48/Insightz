  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nRegret theory states that people anticipate regret if they make the wrong choice, and they consider this anticipation when making decisions.Fear of regret can play a significant role in dissuading someone from taking action or motivating a person to take action. Regret theory can impact an investor'srational behavior, impairing their ability to make investment decisions that would benefit them as opposed to harming them.\n\nWhen investing, regret theory can either make investorsrisk-averse, or it can motivate them to take higher risks. For example, suppose that an investor buys stock in a small growth company based only on a friend's recommendation. After six months, the stock falls to\u00a050% of the purchase price, so the investor sells the stock andrealizes a loss. To avoid this regret in the future, the investor could ask questions and research any stocks that the friend recommends. Or, the investor could decide to never take seriously any investment recommendation made by this friend, regardless of the investmentfundamentals.\n\nConversely, suppose the\u00a0investor didn't take the friend's recommendation to buy the stock,\u00a0and\u00a0the price increased by 50%. To avoid the regret of missing out, the investor could become less risk-averse and might likely buy any stocks that this friend recommends in the future without conducting any background research.\n\nInvestors can minimize the anticipation of regret influencing their investment\u00a0decisions if they have an understanding and an awareness of thepsychology of regret theory. Investors need to look at how regret has affected their investment decisions in the past and take that into account when considering a new opportunity.\n\nFor example, an investor may have missed a large trending move and has subsequently only tradedmomentumstocks\u00a0to try to catch the next significant move. The investor should realize that he\u00a0tends to regret missed opportunities and consider that before deciding to invest in the next trending stock.\n\nIn investing, regret theory and thefear of missing out(often abbreviated as \"FOMO\") frequently go hand in hand. This is particularly evident during times of extendedbull marketswhen the prices of financial securities rise and investor optimism remains high. The fear of missing out on an opportunity to earn profits can drive even the most conservative and risk-averse investor to ignore warning signs of an impending crash.\n\nIrrational exuberance\u2014a phrase famously used by former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan\u2014refers to this excessive investor enthusiasm that pushes asset prices higher than can be justified by the asset's underlying fundamentals.This unwarranted economic optimism can lead to a self-perpetuating pattern of investment behavior.\n\nInvestors begin to believe that the recent rise in prices predicts the future and they continue to invest heavily. Asset bubbles form, which ultimately burst, leading topanic selling. This scenario can be followed by a severe economic downturn or recession. Examples of this include thestock market crash of 1929, the stock market crash of 1987, thedotcom crashof 2001, and the financial crisis of 2007-08.\n\nInvestors can reduce their fear of regret from making incorrect investment decisions by automating the investment process. A strategy\u00a0likeformula investing, which\u00a0strictly follows prescribed rules for making investments, removes most of the decision-making process about what to buy, when to buy,\u00a0and how much to buy.\n\nInvestors can automate their trading strategies and use algorithms for execution and trade management. Using rules-based trading strategies reduces the chance of an investor making a discretionary decision based on a previous investment outcome. Investors can also backtestautomated trading strategies, which could alert them to personal bias errors when they were designing their investment rules.Robo-advisorshave gained in popularity among some investors as they offer access to automated investing combined with a low-cost alternative to traditional advisors.\n\nDiecidue Enrico and Somasundaram Jeeva. \"Regret Theory: A New Foundation.\"Journal of Economic Theory, vol. 172, November 2017, pp. 88-119.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board. \"Remarks by Chairman Alan Greenspan, The Challenge of Central Banking in a Democratic Society.\"\n\nMorningstar. \"2023 Robo-Advisor Landscape.\" Pages 29-30.\n\nGrand View Research. \"Robo Advisory Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Type (Pure Robo Advisors, Hybrid Robo Advisors), By Provider, By Service Type, By End-use, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2022 - 2030.\"",
