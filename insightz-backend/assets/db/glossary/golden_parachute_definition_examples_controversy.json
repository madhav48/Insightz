  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA golden parachute consists of substantial benefits given to top executives if the company is taken over by another firm, and the executives are terminated as a result of themergeror takeover. Golden parachutes are contracts with key executives and can be used as a type of anti-takeover measure, often collectively referred to as poison pills, taken by a firm to discourage an unwantedtakeoverattempt. Benefits may include stock options, cash bonuses, and generous severance pay.\n\nGolden parachutes are thus named as such because they are intended to provide a soft landing for employees of certain levels who lose their jobs.\n\nGolden parachute clauses can be used to define thelucrativebenefits that an employee would receive if they are terminated. The term often relates to the terminations of top executives that result from a takeover or merger. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bGolden parachutes may includeseverance\u00a0payin the form of cash, a special bonus, stock options, or vesting of previously-awarded compensation. The employment contract contains explicit language detailing\u00a0the conditions under which the silver parachute clause will become valid.\n\nIn addition to monetary awards, other examples of opulent parachute benefits\u00a0include:\n\nInstances of these and other exclusive advantages have drawn criticism from shareholders and the public. As a result, the post-financial crisis era has seen many companies review their executive-level compensation policies and devise new ways to link executive performance to corporate success. In many cases, their goal has been to determine whether such packages were in the best interests of the firm and its investors.\n\nThe use of golden parachutes is controversial. Supporters believe that golden parachutes make it easier to hire and retain top executives, particularly in merger-prone industries. In addition, proponents believe that theselucrative benefit packagesallow executives to remain objective if the company is involved in a takeover or merger and that they can discourage takeovers because of the costs that are associated with the golden parachute contracts.\n\nOpponents of golden parachutes argue that executives are already well-compensated and should not be rewarded for being terminated. Opponents may further argue that executives have an inherentfiduciaryresponsibility to act in the best interest of the company and\u00a0should not need an additional financial incentive to remain objective and act in the manner that best benefits the company. In addition, many people who disagree with golden parachutes argue\u00a0that the associated costs are minuscule compared to the takeover costs and, as a result, can have little to no impact on the outcome of the takeover attempt.\n\nThen there is thegolden handshake. It\u00a0is similar to a golden parachute in that it offers aseverance packageto an executive when they become unemployed. While both terms describe severance packages given to such an executive\u00a0upon the termination of duties, a golden handshake goes further to include the severance packages granted to executives upon retirement, too.\n\nSome examples of golden parachutes that have been reported in the press include:\n\nBloomberg. \"HPE\u2019s Whitman Gets $35.6 Million in 2016 After Company Split.\" Accessed March 11, 2021.\n\nSouth Florida Sun Sentinel. \"Office Depot CEO could walk with $39 million after merger.\" Accessed March 11, 2021.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \"Dell Closes $60 Billion Merger with EMC.\" Accessed March 11, 2021.\n\nHartford Business Journal. \"$27 million golden parachute for EMC CEO Joe Tucci.\" Accessed March 11, 2021.",
