  "definition": "The fixed-charge coverage ratio\u00a0(FCCR) measures a firm\u2019s ability to cover itsfixed charges, such as debt payments, interest expenses, and equipment lease expenses. It shows how well a company\u2019searningscan cover its fixed expenses.\n\nBanks will often look at this ratio when evaluating whether to lend money to a business.\n\n\ufeffFCCR=EBIT+FCBTFCBT+iwhere:EBIT=earnings\u00a0before\u00a0interest\u00a0and\u00a0taxesFCBT=fixed\u00a0charges\u00a0before\u00a0taxi=interest\\begin{aligned} &FCCR = \\frac{EBIT + FCBT}{FCBT + i} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &EBIT=\\text{earnings before interest and taxes}\\\\ &FCBT=\\text{fixed charges before tax}\\\\ &i=\\text{interest}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bFCCR=FCBT+iEBIT+FCBT\u200bwhere:EBIT=earnings\u00a0before\u00a0interest\u00a0and\u00a0taxesFCBT=fixed\u00a0charges\u00a0before\u00a0taxi=interest\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe calculation for determining acompany\u2019s ability to cover its fixed charges starts withearnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)from the company\u2019s income statement\u00a0and then adds back interest expense, lease expense, and other fixed charges.\n\nNext, the adjusted EBIT is divided by the amount of fixed charges plus interest. A ratio result of 1.5, for example, shows that a company can pay its fixed charges and interest 1.5 times out of earnings.\n\nThe fixed-charge ratio is used bylenderslooking to analyze the amount ofcash flowa company has available for debt repayment. A low ratio often reveals a lack of ability to make payments on fixed charges, a scenario that lenders try to avoid since it increases the risk that they will not be paid back.\n\nTo avoid this risk, many lenders use coverage ratios, including thetimes interest earned (TIE) ratioand the fixed-charge coverage\u00a0ratio, to determine a company\u2019s ability to take on and pay for additional debt. A company that can cover its fixed charges at a faster rate than its peers is not only more efficient but also more profitable. This is a company that wants to borrow to finance growth rather than to get through a hardship.\n\nA company\u2019s sales and the costs\u00a0related to its sales and operations make up the information shown on itsincome statement. Some costs are variable costs\u00a0and dependent on the volume of sales over a particular time period. As sales increase, so do the variable costs. Other costs are fixed and must be paid regardless of whether or not the business has activity. These\u00a0fixed costs can\u00a0include items such as equipment lease payments, insurance payments, installment payments on existing debt, and preferred dividend payments.\n\nThe goal of computing the fixed-charge coverage ratio is to see how well earnings can cover fixed charges. This ratio is a lot like the TIE ratio, but it is a\u00a0more conservative measure, taking additional fixed charges, including lease expenses, into consideration.\n\nThe fixed-charge coverage ratio is slightly different from the TIE, though the same interpretation can be applied. The fixed-charge coverage ratio adds lease payments to\u00a0earnings before income and taxes (EBIT) and then divides\u00a0by the total interest and lease expenses.\n\nLet\u2019s say Company A records EBIT of $300,000, lease payments of $200,000, and $50,000 in interest expense. The calculation is $300,000 plus $200,000 divided by $50,000 plus $200,000, which is $500,000 divided by $250,000, or a fixed-charge coverage ratio of 2\u00d7.\n\nThe company\u2019s earnings are two times greater than itsfixed costs, which is considered low. That\u2019s because the company would only be able to pay the fixed charges twice with the earnings it has, increasing the risk that it cannot make future payments. The higher this ratio is, the better.\n\nLike the TIE ratio, the higher the FCCR, the better.\n\nThe FCCR doesn\u2019t consider rapid changes in the amount ofcapitalfor new and growing companies. The formula also doesn\u2019t consider the effects of funds taken out of earnings to pay an owner\u2019s draw or pay dividends to investors. These events affect the ratio inputs and can give a misleading conclusion unless othermetricsare also considered.\n\nFor this reason, when banks evaluate a company\u2019screditworthinessfor a loan, they typically look at several other benchmarks in addition to the fixed-charge coverage ratio. This gives them a more complete view of the company\u2019s financial condition.\n\nAdd earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and fixed charges before tax (FCBT), and divide it by the summary of FCBT plus interest. The quotient is the fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR).\n\nBanks will often look at the FCCR when evaluating whether to lend money to a business. Lenders analyze the amount of cash flow a company has available for debt repayment.\n\nBoth events affect the ratio inputs and can give a misleading conclusion unless other metrics are also considered. This is why banks usually look at several other benchmarks in addition to the fixed-charge coverage ratio when they evaluate a company\u2019s creditworthiness for a loan.\n\nThe fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR) measures how well a company\u2019s earnings can be used to cover its fixed charges such as rent, utilities, and debt payments. Lenders often use the fixed-charge coverage ratio to assess a company\u2019s creditworthiness, with a high FCCR indicating that the business can adequately cover fixed charges based on its current earnings alone.",
