  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) describes the relationship betweensystematic risk, or the general perils of investing, andexpected returnfor assets, particularly stocks. It is a finance model that establishes a linear relationship between the required return on an investment and risk.\n\nCAPM is based on the relationship between an asset\u2019sbeta, therisk-free rate(typically theTreasury billrate), and theequity risk premium, or the expected return on the market minus the risk-free rate.\n\nCAPM evolved as a way to measure this systematic risk. It is widely used throughout finance for pricing riskysecuritiesand generating expected returns for assets, given the risk of those assets andcost of capital.\n\nThe formula for calculating the expected return of anasset, given itsrisk, is\u00a0as follows:\n\nERi=Rf+\u03b2i(ERm\u2212Rf)where:ERi=expected\u00a0return\u00a0of\u00a0investmentRf=risk-free\u00a0rate\u03b2i=beta\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0investment(ERm\u2212Rf)=market\u00a0risk\u00a0premium\\begin{aligned} &ER_i = R_f + \\beta_i ( ER_m - R_f ) \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &ER_i = \\text{expected return of investment} \\\\ &R_f = \\text{risk-free rate} \\\\ &\\beta_i = \\text{beta of the investment} \\\\ &(ER_m - R_f) = \\text{market risk premium} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bERi\u200b=Rf\u200b+\u03b2i\u200b(ERm\u200b\u2212Rf\u200b)where:ERi\u200b=expected\u00a0return\u00a0of\u00a0investmentRf\u200b=risk-free\u00a0rate\u03b2i\u200b=beta\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0investment(ERm\u200b\u2212Rf\u200b)=market\u00a0risk\u00a0premium\u200b\n\nInvestors expect to be compensated for risk and thetime value of money. The risk-free rate in the CAPM formula accounts for the time value of money. The other components of the CAPM formula account for theinvestortaking on additional risk.\n\nThegoal of the CAPM formulais to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued when its risk and the time value of money are compared with its expected return. In other words, by knowing the individual parts of the CAPM, it is possible to gauge whether thecurrent priceof a stock is consistent with its likely return.\n\nThe CAPM seeks to gauge whether a stock's current price is consistent with its likely return.\n\nBeta compares a security or portfolio's volatility or systematic risk to the market. If astockis riskier than the market, it will have a beta greater than one. If a stock has a beta of less than one, the formula assumes it will reduce the risk of aportfolio.\n\nA stock\u2019s beta is then multiplied by themarket risk premium, which is the return expected from the market above the risk-free rate. Therisk-free rateis then added to the product of the stock\u2019s beta and\u00a0the market risk premium. The result should give an investor therequired returnordiscount ratethat they can use to find the value of an asset.\n\nImagine an investor is contemplating a stock valued at $100 persharetoday that pays a 3% annualdividend. Say this stock has a beta compared with the market of 1.3, which means it is more volatile than a broad market portfolio (i.e., the S&P 500 Index). Also, assume that the risk-free rate is 3% and this investor expects the market to rise in value by 8% per year.\n\nThe expected return of the stock based on the CAPM formula is 9.5%:\n\n9.5%=3%+1.3\u00d7(8%\u22123%)\\begin{aligned} &9.5\\% = 3\\% + 1.3 \\times ( 8\\% - 3\\% ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200b9.5%=3%+1.3\u00d7(8%\u22123%)\u200b\n\nThe expected return of the CAPM formula is used to discount the expected dividends andcapital appreciationof the stock over the expected holding period. If the discounted value of those future cash flows is equal to $100, then the CAPM formula indicates the stock is fairly valued relative to risk.\n\nSeveral assumptions behind the CAPM formula have been shown not to hold up in reality. Modern financial theory rests on two assumptions:\n\nAs a result, it\u2019s not entirely clear whether CAPM works. The big sticking point is beta. When professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French looked at share returns on theNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE), theAmerican Stock Exchange (AMEX), andNasdaq, they found that differences in betas over a lengthy period did not explain the performance of different stocks. The linear relationship between beta and individual stock returns also breaks down over shorter periods of time. These findings seem to suggest that CAPM may be wrong.\n\nIncluding beta in the formula assumes that risk can be measured by a stock\u2019s pricevolatility. However, price movements in both directions are not equally risky. The look-back period to determine a stock\u2019s volatility is not standard because stock returns (and risk) are notnormally distributed.\n\nThe CAPM also assumes that the risk-free rate will remain constant over the discounting period. Assume in the previous example that the interest rate on U.S. Treasury bonds rose to 5% or 6% during the 10-year holding period. An increase in the risk-free rate also increases the cost of the capital used in the investment and could make the stock lookovervalued.\n\nThe period when the CAPM was conceived.\n\nThe market portfolio used to find the market risk premium is only a theoretical value and is not an asset that can be purchased or invested in as an alternative to the stock. Most of the time, investors will use a major stock index, like theS&P 500, to substitute for the market, which is an imperfect comparison.\n\nThe most serious critique of the CAPM is the assumption that future cash flows can be estimated for the discounting process. If an investor could estimate the future return of a stock with a high level of accuracy, then the CAPM would not be necessary.\n\nUsing the CAPM to build a portfolio is supposed to help an investor manage their risk. If an investor were able to use the CAPM to perfectly optimize a portfolio\u2019s return relative to risk, it would exist on a curve called theefficient frontier, as shown in the following graph.\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2022\n\nThe graph shows how greater expected returns (y axis) require greater expected risk (x axis).Modern portfolio theory (MPT)suggests that starting with the risk-free rate, the expected return of a portfolio increases as the risk increases. Any portfolio that fits on thecapital market line (CML)is better than any possible portfolio to the right of that line, but, at some point, a theoretical portfolio can be constructed on the CML with the best return for the amount of risk being taken.\n\nThe CML and the efficient frontier may be difficult to define, but they illustrate an important concept for investors: There is a tradeoff between increased return and increased risk. Because it isn\u2019t possible to perfectly build a portfolio that fits on the CML, it is more common for investors to take on too much risk as they seek additional return.\n\nIn the following chart, you can see two portfolios that have been constructed to fit along the efficient frontier. Portfolio A is expected to return 8% per year and has a 10%standard deviationor risk level. Portfolio B is expected to return 10% per year but has a 16% standard deviation. The risk of Portfolio B rose faster than its expected returns.\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2022\n\nThe efficient frontier assumes the same things as the CAPM and can only be calculated in theory. If a portfolio existed on the efficient frontier, it would provide maximal return for its level of risk. However, it is impossible to know whether a portfolio exists on the efficient frontier because future returns cannot be predicted.\n\nThis tradeoff between risk and return applies to the CAPM, and the efficient frontier graph can be rearranged to illustrate the tradeoff for individual assets. In the following chart, you can see that the CML is now called thesecurity market line (SML). Instead of expected risk on the x axis, the stock\u2019s beta is used. As you can see in the illustration, as beta increases from 1 to 2, the expected return is also rising.\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2022\n\nThe CAPM and the SML make a connection between a stock\u2019s beta and its expected risk. Beta is found by statistical analysis of individual, daily share price returns compared with the market\u2019s daily returns over precisely the same period. A higher beta means more risk, but a portfolio of high-beta stocks could exist somewhere on the CML where the tradeoff is acceptable, if not the theoretical ideal.\n\nThe value of these two models is diminished by assumptions about beta and market participants that aren\u2019t true in the real markets. For example, beta does not account for the relative riskiness of a stock that is more volatile than the market with a high frequency of downside shocks compared with another stock with an equally high beta that does not experience the same kind of price movements to the downside.\n\nConsidering the critiques of the CAPM and the assumptions behind its use in portfolio construction, it might be difficult to see how it could be useful. However, using the CAPM as a tool to evaluate the reasonableness of future expectations or to conduct comparisons can still have some value.\n\nImagine an advisor who has proposed adding a stock to a portfolio with a $100 share price. The advisor uses the CAPM to justify the price with a discount rate of 13%. The advisor\u2019s investment manager can take this information and compare it with the company\u2019s past performance and its peers to see if a 13% return is a reasonable expectation. Assume in this example that the peer group\u2019s performance over the last few years was a little better than 10%, while this stock had consistently underperformed, with 9% returns. The investment manager shouldn\u2019t take the advisor\u2019s recommendation without some justification for the increased expected return.\n\nThe CAPM can help generate ideas and reassess holdings but shouldn't be the only method used to value stocks.\n\nAn investor also can use the concepts from the CAPM and the efficient frontier to evaluate their portfolio or individual stock performance vs. the rest of the market. For example, assume that an investor\u2019s portfolio has returned 10% per year for the last three years with a standard deviation of returns (risk) of 10%. However, the market averages have returned 10% for the last three years with a risk of 8%.\n\nThe investor could use this observation to reevaluate how their portfolio is constructed and which holdings may not be on the SML. This could explain why the investor\u2019s portfolio is to the right of the CML. If the holdings that are either dragging on returns or have increased the portfolio\u2019s risk disproportionately can be identified, then the investor can make changes to improve returns.\n\nNot surprisingly, the CAPM contributed to the rise in the use ofindexing, or assembling a portfolio of shares to mimic a particular market or asset class, byrisk-averseinvestors. This is largely due to the CAPM message that it is only possible to earn higher returns than those of the market as a whole by taking on higher risk (beta).\n\nThe capital asset pricing model (CAPM) was developed in the early 1960s by financial economistsWilliam Sharpe, Jack Treynor, John Lintner, and Jan Mossin, who built their work on ideas put forth byHarry Markowitzin the 1950s.\n\nThe following are assumptions made by the CAPM:\n\nMany of these assumptions have been challenged as being unrealistic or plain wrong.\n\nBecause of its criticisms, several alternative models to the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) have been developed to understand the relationship between risk and reward in investments. One of these isarbitrage pricing theory (APT), a model that looks at multiple factors, grouped into macroeconomic or company-specific factors.Another is theFama-French 3-factor model, which expands on CAPM by adding company-size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factors.\n\nIn 2015, Fama and French adapted their model to include five factors. Along with the original three factors, the new model adds the concept that companies reporting higher future earnings have higher returns in the stock market, a factor referred to as profitability. The fifth factor, referred to as \u201cinvestment,\u201d relates to the concept of internal investment and returns, suggesting that companies directing profit toward major growth projects are likely to experience losses in the stock market.\n\nTheinternational capital asset pricing model (ICAPM)is a financial model that applies the traditional CAPM principle to international investments. It extends CAPM by considering the direct and indirect exposure to foreign currency in addition to time value and market risk included in the CAPM.\n\nThe CAPM uses the principles of modern portfolio theory to determine if a security is fairly valued. It relies on assumptions about investor behaviors, risk and return distributions, and market fundamentals that don\u2019t match reality.\n\nHowever, the underlying concepts of CAPM and the associated efficient frontier can help investors understand therelationship between expected risk and rewardas they strive to make better decisions about adding securities to a portfolio.\n\nU.S. Department of Commerce, Commercial Law Development Program. \u201cFinancial Modeling: CAPM & WACC.\u201d\n\nFama, Eugene F., and Kenneth R.
