  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nThe average annual return (AAR) is a percentage used when reporting the historical return, such as the three-, five-, and 10-yearaverage returnsof a mutual fund. The average annual return is stated net of a fund's operating expense ratio. Additionally, it does not include sales charges, if applicable, or portfolio transaction brokerage commissions.\n\nIn its simplest terms, the average annual return (AAR) measures the money made or lost by a mutual fund over a given period. Investors considering a mutual fund investment will often review the AAR and compare it with other similar mutual funds as part of theirmutual fund investment strategy.\n\nWhen you are selecting amutual fund, the average annual return is a helpful guide for measuring a fund's long-term performance. However, investors should also look at a fund's yearly performance to fully appreciate the consistency of its annualtotal returns.\n\nFor example, a five-year average annual return of 10% looks attractive. However, if the yearly returns (those that produced the average annual return) were +40%, +30%, -10%, +5% and -15% (50 / 5 = 10%), performance over the past three years warrants examination of the fund\u2019s management and investment strategy.\n\nThere are three components that contribute to the average annual return (AAR) of an equity mutual fund: share price appreciation, capital gains, and dividends.\n\nShare price appreciationresults from unrealized gains or losses in the underlying stocks held in a portfolio. As the share price of a stock fluctuates over a year, it proportionately contributes to or detracts from the AAR of the fund that maintains a holding in the issue.\n\nFor example, theAmerican Funds AMCAP Fund\u2019stop holding is Netflix (NFLX), which represents 3.7% of the portfolio's net assets as of Feb. 29, 2020. Netflix is one of 199 equities in the AMCAP fund. Fund managers can add or subtract assets from the fund or change the proportions of each holding as needed to meet the fund's performance objectives. The fund's combined assets have contributed to the portfolio\u2019s 10-year AAR of 11.58% through Feb. 29, 2020.\n\nCapital gainsdistributions paid from a mutual fund result from the generation of income or sale of stocks from which a manager realizes a profit in a growth portfolio. Shareholders can opt to receive the distributions in cash or reinvest them in the fund. Capital gains are the realized portion of AAR. The distribution, which reduces share price by the dollar amount paid out, represents a taxable gain for shareholders.\n\nA fund can have a negative AAR and still make taxabledistributions. The Wells Fargo Discovery Fund paid a capital gain of $2.59 on Dec. 11, 2015, despite the fund having an AAR of negative 1.48%.\n\nQuarterlydividendspaid from company earnings contribute to a mutual fund's AAR and also reduce the value of a portfolio'snet asset value(NAV). Like capital gains, dividend income received from the portfolio can be reinvested or taken in cash.\n\nLarge-cap stock fundswith positive earnings typically pay dividends to individual and institutional shareholders. These quarterly distributions comprise the dividend yield component of a mutual fund's AAR. TheT. Rowe Price Dividend Growth Fundhas a trailing 12-month yield of 1.36%, a contributing factor to the fund\u2019s three-year AAR of 15.65% through Feb. 29, 2020.\n\nCalculating an average annual return is much simpler than the average annual rate of return, which uses ageometric averageinstead of a regular mean.\u00a0The formula is: [(1+r1) x (1+r2) x (1+r3) x ... x (1+ri)](1/n)- 1, where r is the annual rate of return and n is the number of years in the period.\n\nThe average annual return is sometimes considered less useful for giving a picture of the performance of a fund because returnscompoundrather than combine. Investors must pay attention whenlooking at mutual fundsto compare the same types of returns for each fund.",
