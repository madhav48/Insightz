  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) ranks countries based on key indicators of well-being, such as health, education, and income levels.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI), developed by the United Nations, serves as a benchmark for assessing how well countries are doing in terms of improving people's quality of life, factoring in elements like health, education, and income. It is composed of four principal areas of interest: mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling,life expectancyat birth, andgross national income(GNI) per capita.\n\nThis index is a tool used to follow changes in development levels over time and compare the development levels of different countries.\n\nThe HDI was established to place emphasis on individuals\u2014or,more precisely, on their opportunities to realize satisfying work and lives. Evaluating a country\u2019s potential for individual human development provides a supplementary metric for evaluating a country\u2019s level of development besides considering standard economic growth statistics, such asgross domestic product(GDP).\n\nThis index can also be used to examine the various policy choices of nations; if, for example, two countries have approximately the same GNI per capita, then the HDI can help to evaluate why they produce widely disparate human development outcomes. Proponents of the HDI hope it can be used to stimulate such productive public policy debate.\n\nThe HDI is a summary measurement of basic achievement levels in human development. The computed HDI of a country is an average of indices of each of the life aspects that are examined:\u00a0knowledge and understanding, a long and healthy life, and an acceptablestandard of living. Each of the components is normalized to a scale between zero and one, and then thegeometric meanof the three components is calculated.\n\nThe final HDI score for each country is calculated as a geometric mean of the three components by taking the cube root of the product of the normalized component scores.\n\nSwitzerland scores the highest among 193 countries in the 2023/2024 HDI rankings from the U.N.\n\nTop HDI scores go heavily to Northern European countries, while the lowest-scoring nations are largely found on the African continent.\n\nThe top 25 countries in the 2023/2024 HDI rankings are in the table below.\n\nThe bottom five countries are in the table below.\n\nThere arecriticisms of the HDI. It is a simplification and an admittedly limited evaluation of human development. The HDI does not specifically reflect quality-of-life factors, such as empowerment movements or overall feelings of security.\n\nIn recognition of these facts, the U.N. Human Development Report Office (HDRO) provides additional composite indices to evaluate other life aspects, including inequality issues such as gender disparity or racial inequality.\n\nExamination and evaluation of a country\u2019s HDI are best done in concert with examining these and other factors, such as the country\u2019s rate of economic growth, expansion of employment opportunities, and the success of initiatives undertaken to improve the overall quality of life within a country.\n\nSeveral economists say the HDI is essentially redundant as a result of the high correlations among the HDI, its components, and simpler measures of income per capita.\n\nGNI per capita (or even GDP per capita) correlates very highly with both the overall HDI and the other two components in both values and rankings.\n\nGiven these strong and consistent correlations, they say, it would be simpler and clearer just to compare per-capita GNI across countries than to spend time and resources collecting data for the additional components that provide little or no additional information for the overall index.\n\nIndeed, a fundamental principle of the composite index design is not to include multiple additional components that are strongly correlated in a way that suggests that they might reflect the same underlying phenomenon. This is to prevent inefficient double-counting and avoid introducing additional sources of potential errors in the data.\n\nIn the case of the HDI, the inclusion of the components is problematic because it is easily plausible that higher average incomes directly lead to both more investment in formal education and better health and longevity. Moreover, definitions and measurements of years of schooling and life expectancy can vary widely from country to country.\n\nThe human development index (HDI) measures a country's educational level and economic well-being. The index for each country ranges from 0 to 1, based on the country's life expectancy, gross national income, and average years of schooling. A higher index value indicates a higher level of economic and social development.\n\nThe HDI was introduced by the United Nations in 1990 to provide a single, simple yardstick to compare social development across countries. However, some critics say it is not an effective metric because it does not reflect other factors, like economic inequality or overall feelings of security. To address those shortcomings, the U.N. also publishes more specific figures that can provide a more granular view of human development.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) measures each country\u2019s social and economic development by focusing on the following four factors: mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, life expectancy at birth, and gross national income (GNI) per capita.\n\nThe higher the HDI, the better. A high HDI essentially means that the country in question offers a generally high standard of living, with decent healthcare, education, and opportunities to earn money.\n\nFrom the 2023/2024 Human Development Report, Switzerland finished first with an HDI value of 0.967. Norway, Iceland, Hong Kong, and Denmark rounded out the top five. Meanwhile, the United States was ranked 20th with an HDI value of 0.927.\n\nThe United Nations' Human Development Index (HDI) seeks to quantify a country's level of prosperity based on both economic and non-economic factors. Non-economic factors include life expectancy and educational attainment.\n\nEconomic factors are measured by gross national income (GNI) per capita. While the U.N. argues that the HDI improves our understanding of relative well-being around the world, economists have criticized the index as overly simplistic and flawed in its methodology.\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports. \"Human Development Index (HDI).\"\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports. \u201cTechnical Notes: Calculating the Human Development Indices\u2014Graphical Presentation.\u201d Pages 2\u20133.\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports. \u201cTechnical Notes: Calculating the Human Development Indices\u2014Graphical Presentation.\u201d Page 2.\n\nUnited Nations Development Programme, Human Development Reports. \u201cHuman Development Insights.\u201d\n\nCahill, Miles B. \u201cIs the Human Development Index Redundant?,\u201dEastern Economic Journal, vol. 31, no. 1, Winter 2005, pp. 1\u20135.",
