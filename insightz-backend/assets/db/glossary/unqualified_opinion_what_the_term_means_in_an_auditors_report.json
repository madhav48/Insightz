It is the type of opinion most companies expect to receive from an independent auditor and reassures investors in the company that the financial information they have been given is presented in an accurate and fair manner.\n\nAn unqualified opinion is the most common type given in anauditor's report. Like any auditor\u2019s opinion, it does not judge the actual financial position of the company or interpret financial data. It simply indicates that the independent auditor has seen enough information to conclude that the company's financial statements conform to GAAP and fairly present the company's financial position for the stated time frame. It is issued when the auditor believes that all changes, accounting policies, and their application and effects, have accurately been disclosed.\n\nAn auditor can give four basic types of opinion:\n\nWith aqualified opinion, the auditor has determined there is a material issue regarding accounting policies\u2014but one that does not misrepresent the factual financial position. Auditors typically qualify reports with statements like \"except for the following adjustments,\" when they have insufficient information to verify certain aspects of the transactions and reports being audited.\n\nQualified opinions may also be issued if the financial statements deviate from GAAP or have inadequate disclosure. The auditor might report anadverse opinionif they believe the financial statements do not accurately represent the company's financial position. They might also issue a disclaimer of opinion if they cannot issue an opinion on the financial statements because something has prevented them from gathering enough information.",
