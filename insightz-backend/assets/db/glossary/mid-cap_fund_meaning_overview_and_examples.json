He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA mid-cap fund is a pooled investment vehicle (e.g. a mutual fund or ETF) that explicitly invests in the stocks ofmid-capcompanies, or companies withmarket capitalizationsranging from approximately $2 billion to $10 billion.\n\nMid-cap funds provide a diversified portfolio ofmid-cap companiesfor investors. Mid-cap stock funds invest in firms with established businesses. Therefore, these companies have made equity capital markets a substantial part of their capital structures. Overall, mid-cap companies tend to offer more growth potential than large-cap stocks and with lessvolatilitythan the small-cap segment. Mid-cap funds seek to capitalize on this capital appreciation potential by creating funds that are diversified among mid-cap companies.\n\nMany fund companies andindexes focus on mid-cap stockswith an additional component such as growth or value. Mid-cap funds can be actively managed or passively managed. The mid-cap segment of the market offers a wide range of investment options for investors. Some of the mid-cap segment's most popular benchmarks are the S&P MidCap 400, the Russell 1000 MidCap Index, and the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index. As of December 2020, the smallest member of the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index was valued at $0.8 billion. The largest had a market capitalization of $23.4 billion.\n\n\"Mid-cap\" is the term given to companies with a market capitalization (or value) between $2 billion and $10 billion.As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle betweenlarge-cap(or big-cap) andsmall-capcompanies. Classifications such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are only approximations and may change over time.\n\nMostfinancial advisorssuggest that the key to minimizing risk is a diversified portfolio; investors should have a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks. However, some investors see mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth potential, but that growth comes with the most risk. Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, but they offer lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks are a hybrid of the two, providing both growth and stability.\n\nMid-cap funds have some advantages over both individual mid-cap stocks and other fund types. While less volatile than small-cap stocks, holding only a few mid-cap funds is usually much riskier than holding several large-cap stocks. Byinvesting in a mid-cap fund, investors can capture the growth potential of mid-cap funds without company-specific risks.\n\nMid-cap funds can follow a somewhat different pattern than either large or small stocks. Because of this they are useful for portfolio diversification. Historically, there have been long periods when either large or small stocks outperformed. Choosing a mid-cap fund can prevent investors from going too far in the wrong direction.\n\nBy investing in a mid-cap fund rather than holding individual mid-cap stocks, investors can miss out on massive gains. In particular, theCAN SLIMsystem developed byWilliam J. O'Neilis often applied successfully to mid-cap stocks. The idea is that winning stocks can be spotted on their way up through the small caps. By the time stocks reach the mid-cap funds, the speculators are ready to profit. For example, O'Neil flagged Netflix (NFLX) as a top pick in 2009. However, most investors are less successful at picking winners.\n\nHere are some examples of the market\u2019stop mid-cap funds.\n\nThe BlackRock MidCap Growth Equity Fund is an actively managed mutual fund.
