  "definition": "Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia\n\nThe 1%/10 net 30 payment term offers a 1% discount to payees if they're willing to pay an invoice within the first 10 days of a 30-day payment period.\n\n1%/10 net 30 is a payment term used to incentivize a payor to pay an invoice early to capture acash discounton purchases. This means that if the bill is paid within 10 days, a 1% discount will be applied to the purchase price. Otherwise, the full total amount is due within 30 days.\n\nThe 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents thecreditterms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. Thevendormay offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash. This is particularly important for cash-strapped businesses or companies with no revolvinglines of credit. Companies with higherprofit marginsare more likely to offer cash discounts.\n\nAlthough the numbers are always interchangeable across vendors, the standard structure for offering a payment discount is the same. The first number will always be the percentage discount. This figure will indicate the total percentage discount on the invoice prior to shipping or taxes that may be discounted upon early payment.\n\nDiscount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtualshort-term loans. This is because if the discount is not taken, the buyer must pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost. In effect, the difference between these two prices reflects the discount lost, which can be reported as a percentage. This percentage is called the cost of credit.\n\nWhen the credit terms are 1%/10 net 30, the net result becomes, in essence, aninterestcharge of 18.2% upon the failure to take the discount.\n\nCompanies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts.\n\nTheaccountingentry for a cash discount taken may be performed in two ways.\n\nThe gross method of purchase discounts assumes the discount will not be taken and will only input the discount upon actual receipt of payment within the discount period. Therefore, the entire amount of receivable will bedebited. When payment is received, the receivable will be credited in the amount of the payment and the difference will be a credit to discounts taken.\n\nThe alternative method is called the net method. For a discount of 1%/10 net 30, it is assumed that the 1% discount will be taken. This results in a receivable being debited for 99% of the total cost.\n\nFor example, if \u201c$1,000 - 1%/10 net 30\u201d is written on a bill, the buyer can take a 1% discount ($1,000 \u00d7 0.01 = $10) and make a payment of $990 within 10 days, or pay the entire $1,000 within 30 days.\n\nIf the invoice is not paid within the discount period, no price reduction occurs, and the invoice must be paid within the stipulated number of days beforelate feesmay be assessed.\n\nThe second number is always the number of days of thediscount period. In the example above, the discount period is 10 days. Finally, the third number always reflects the invoice due date.\n\nThe 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents the credit terms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. The vendor may offer incentives to pay early toaccelerate the inflow of cash.\n\nYes. Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual short-term loans. If the discount is not taken, the buyer must then pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost.\n\nThe first number is always the percentage of the discount. The second number is always the number of days of the discount period. The third number always reflects the invoice due date.\n\nThe 1%/10 net 30 calculation provides cash discounts on purchases. If the bill is paid within 10 days, there is a 1% discount. Otherwise, the total amount is due within 30 days.",
