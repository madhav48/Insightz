  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an international agreement that aimed to reducecarbon dioxideemissions and the presence ofgreenhouse gases(GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol was that industrialized nations needed to reduce their CO2 emissions. The protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, as greenhouse gas emissions threatened climate stability.It was effectively replaced by the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in 2016.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated thatindustrialized nationscut their greenhouse gas emissions at a time when the threat of global warming was growing rapidly. The Protocol was linked to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\u00a0It was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on Dec. 11, 1997, and became international law on Feb. 16, 2005.\n\nCountries that ratified the Kyoto Protocol were assigned maximum carbon emission levels for specific periods and participated incarbon credit trading. If a country emitted more than its assigned limit, then it would be penalized by receiving a lower emissions limit in thefollowing period.\n\nDeveloped, industrialized countries made a promise under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their annualhydrocarbonemissions by an average of 5.2% by the year 2012.Targets depended on the individual country. As a result, each nation had a different target to meet by that year. Members of theEuropean Union (EU)pledged to cut emissions by 8%, while the U.S. and Canada promised to reduce their emissions by 7% and 6%, respectively, by 2012.\n\nThe amount of the Kyoto Protocol fund that was meant to aid developing countries in selecting industrialized processes and technologies that did not emit GHGs.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol established three different mechanisms to enable countries to meet their targeted emissions limits. The three mechanisms were:\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol recognized that developed countries are principally responsible for the high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere as a result of more than 150 years of industrial activity.As such, the protocol placed a heavier burden on developed nations compared to less-developed nations.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol mandated that 37 industrialized nations and the EU cut their GHG emissions.Developing nations were asked to comply voluntarily, and more than 100 developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from the Kyoto agreement altogether.\n\nThe protocol separated countries into two groups: Annex I contained developed nations, and Non-Annex I referred to developing countries. The protocol placed emission limitations on Annex I countries only. Non-Annex I nations participated by investing in projects designed to lower emissions in their countries.\n\nFor these projects, developing countries earnedcarbon credits, which they could trade or sell to developed countries, allowing the developed nations a higher level of maximum carbon emissions for that period. In effect, this function helped the developed countries to continue emitting GHG vigorously.\n\nThe U.S., which ratified the original Kyoto Protocol, dropped out of the protocol in 2001. The U.S. believed that the agreement was unfair because it called only for industrialized nations to limit emissions reductions, and it felt that doing so would hurt the U.S. economy.\n\nGlobal emissions were still on the rise by 2005, the year the Kyoto Protocol became international law.In fact, there was an increase of about 40% in emissions globally between 1990 and 2009.\n\nThe EU was able to exceed its initial target and said it was on track to meet its goals to continue reducing emissions in the future.However, the United States and China, two of the world's biggest emitters, produced enough greenhouse gases to mitigate any of the progress made by other nations that met their targets.\n\nIn December 2012, after the first commitment period of the Protocol ended, parties to the Kyoto Protocol met in Doha, Qatar, to adopt an amendment to the original Kyoto agreement. This so-called Doha Amendment added new emission reduction targets for the second commitment period, 2012\u20132020, for participating countries.\n\nThe Doha Amendment had a short life. In 2015, at the sustainable development summit held in Paris, all UNFCCC participants signed yet another pact, theParis Climate Agreement, which effectively replaced the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe Paris Climate Agreement is a landmark environmental pact that was adopted by nearly every nation in 2015 toaddress climate changeand its negative effects. The agreement includes commitments from all major GHG-emitting countries to cut their climate-altering pollution and to strengthen those commitments over time.\n\nA major directive of the deal calls for reducing global GHG emissions to limit the earth's temperature increase in this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius, with an aim for below 1.5-degrees Celsius relative to preindustrial levels. The Paris Agreement also provides a way for developed nations to assist developing nations in their efforts to adapt climate control, and it creates a framework for monitoring and reporting countries\u2019 climate goalstransparently.\n\nEvery five years, countries engage in the Global Stocktake, which is an assessment of their progress under the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nIn 2016, when the Paris Climate Agreement went into force, the United States was one of the principal drivers of the agreement, and President Obama hailed it as \u201ca tribute to American leadership.\u201d\n\nIn the same period, presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized the agreement as a bad deal for the American people and pledged to withdraw from the agreement if elected. In 2017, then-President Trump announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\nThe Trump administration did not begin the formal withdrawal process until Nov. 4, 2019.The U.S. formally withdrew from the Paris Climate Agreement on Nov. 4, 2020, the day after the 2020 presidential election, in which Donald Trump lost his reelection bid to Joseph Biden.\n\nOn Jan. 20, 2021, his first day in office, President Biden began the process of rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, which officially took effect on Feb. 19, 2021.However, when President Trump returned to office in 2025, he again announced his intention to exit the Paris Agreement and signed an executive order to that effect.\n\nBelow are some relevant dates relating to the development, implementation, and revisions to the Kyoto Protocol:\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was an agreement among developed nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases in an effort to minimize the impacts of climate change.\n\nThe United States backed out of the Kyoto Protocol agreement in 2001 on the basis that it unfairly burdened developed nations. The treaty called only for developed nations to reduce emissions, which the U.S. believed would unfairly stifle its economy.\n\nAfter becoming a signatory in 2013, Afghanistan became the 192nd and last signatory of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol was created in response to concerns surrounding climate change. The treaty was an agreement between developed nations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and greenhouse gases. The framework implemented the United Nations' target of reducing global warming consequences including a general rise in sea levels, disappearance of some island states, melting of glaciers, and an increase in extreme climate-related events.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is largely considered a landmark legislative achievement as one of the more prominent international treaties in regards to climate change. Though the treaty has been superseded by the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol remains an important part of environmental and conservation history.\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"What Is the Kyoto Protocol?\"\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"What Is the Paris Agreement?\"\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"Industrialized Countries to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions by 5.2%.\"\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"Kyoto Protocol Reference Manual,\" Page 13.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement: A Summary,\" Summary Page.\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"Emissions Trading.\"\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"Mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement: A Summary,\" Page 1.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement: A Summary,\" Page 4.\n\nBabiker, Mustafa and et al. \"The Kyoto Protocol and Developing Countries.\"MIT Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, Report No. 56, October 1999, pp. 5.\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"Parties & Observers.\"\n\nThe White House: Bush Administration (Archive). \"President Bush Discusses Global Climate Change.\"\n\nWorld Resources Institute. \"World Greenhouse Gas Emissions: 2005.\"\n\nOlivier, J.G.J. and Peters, J.A.H.W. \"No Growth in Total Global CO2 Emissions in 2009.\"Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, January 2010.\n\nEuropean Commission. \"EU Over-Achieved First Kyoto Emissions Target, On Track to Meet 2020 Objective.\"\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, World 101. \"Who Releases the Most Greenhouse Gases?\"\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \"The Doha Amendment.\"\n\nUnited Nations Treaty Collection. \"Paris Agreement.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement: A Summary,\" Pages 7-8.\n\nThe White House: Obama Adminstration (Archive). \"Statement by the President on the Paris Climate Agreement.\"\n\nU.S. Department of State (Archive). \"On the U.S. Withdrawal From the Paris Agreement.\"\n\nThe New York Times. \"Presidential Election Results: Biden Wins.\"\n\nThe New York Times. \"The U.S. Left the Paris Climate Pact.
