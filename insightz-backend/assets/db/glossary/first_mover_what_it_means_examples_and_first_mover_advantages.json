  "term": "First Mover: What It Means, Examples, and First Mover Advantages",
  "definition": "A first mover is a service or product that gains acompetitive advantageby being the first to market with a product or service. Being first typically enables a company to establish strong brand recognition and customer loyalty before competitors enter the arena. Other advantages include additional time to perfect its product or service and setting the market price for the new item.\n\nFirst movers in an industry are almost always followed by competitors that attempt tocapitalizeon the first mover's success and gain\u00a0market share. Most often, the first mover has established sufficient\u00a0market share\u00a0and a solid enough customer base that it maintains the majority\u00a0of the market.\n\nBusinesses with a first-mover advantage include innovators, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN)and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Amazon created the first online bookstore, which was immensely successful. By the time other retailers established an online bookstore presence, Amazon had achieved significant brand recognition and parlayed its first-mover advantage into marketing a range of additional, unrelated products. According to Forbes's \"The World's Most Innovative Companies\" 2019 ranking, Amazon ranks second. It has annual revenues of $280 billion and, through the end of 2019, had a 20% annual sales growth rate.\n\neBay built the first meaningful online auction website in 1995 and continues to be a popular shopping site worldwide. It ranked 43rd on the Forbes list of innovative companies. The company generates $287 billion in annual revenues, with a 2.8% annual sales growth rate.\n\nBeing the first to develop and market a product comes with manyprime advantagesthat strengthen a company's position in the marketplace. For example, a first-mover often gains exclusive agreements with suppliers, sets industry standards, and develops strong relationships with retailers. Other advantages include\n\nDespite the many advantages associated with being a first mover, there are also disadvantages.\u00a0For example, other businesses can copy and improve upon a first mover's products, thereby capturing the first mover's share of the market.\n\nIt costs\u00a0approximately 60% to 75% less to replicate a product\u00a0than it costs to create a new product.\n\nAlso, often in the race to be the first to market, a company may forsake key product features to expedite production.\u00a0If the market responds unfavorably, then later entrants could capitalize on the first mover's failure to produce a product that aligns with consumer interests; and the cost to create versus the cost to imitate is significantly disproportionate.",
