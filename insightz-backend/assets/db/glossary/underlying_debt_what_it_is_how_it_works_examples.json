However, the implicit backing of larger entities facilitates borrowing by smaller entities and allows them to obtain lower interest rates on their obligations. People consider the municipal bonds to be the underlying debt of the backing entity.\n\nThe\u00a0underlying debt situation of smaller municipal debts being implicitly backed by larger governmental entities is quite common in practice. This occurs where smaller entities like cities and school districts offer bonds to the public to finance operations and new initiatives. If a smaller entity is unable to repay its debts, it is unlikely that the city or school district will simply be allowed to become insolvent and cease operations. Rather it is expected that the state will intervene to provide emergency funding to continue debt service and maintain essential services.\n\nUnderlying debt applies togeneral obligationmunicipal bonds, which are backed by the taxing authority of the issuer or, in the case of underlying debt, the authority of the larger government entity. This sharing of credit responsibilities generally acts as\u00a0acredit\u00a0enhancementfor the\u00a0bond issuer. When ratings agencies such as Standard & Poor\u2019s and Moody\u2019s assign an underlying rating for these issuers, the ratings reflect the characteristics of the issuer on a standalone basis.\n\nIn addition, the carrying of underlying debt is considered in the rating of larger municipal issuers, specifically their ability to meet all financial obligations, including underlying debt, and to make scheduled interest payments on time. If a smaller entity is having trouble meeting its obligations, the rating of the larger entity carrying the underlying debt can be negatively impacted.\n\nSeparate municipalities within a city or country may issue their own debt obligations to finance projects such as hospitals, roads, schools or sanitation facilities. In many cases, the city or county carries these obligations as underlying debt. This is the case in Illinois, where the state relies on the taxing authority of the legislature toback bonds issued by Chicago.\n\nUnderlying debt can create additional risks for the larger entity backing the debt as was the case in the state of New York in the 1970s when New York City nearly went insolvent.\n\nStandard & Poor's. \"S&P Global Ratings Definitions.\" Accessed Mar. 18, 2021.\n\nMoody's. \"Moody's Investors Service Products.\" Accessed Mar. 18, 2021.\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"The 1970's.\" Accessed Mar. 18, 2021.",
