  "definition": "Distribution management refers to\u00a0the process of overseeing the movement of goods from supplier or manufacturer to point of sale. It is an overarching term that refers to numerous activities and processes such as packaging, inventory,warehousing,supply chain, andlogistics.\n\nDistributionmanagement is an important part of thebusiness cyclefor distributors and wholesalers. The profit margins of businesses depend on how quickly they can turn over their goods. The more they sell, the more they earn, which means a better future for the business. Having a successful distribution management system is also important for businesses to remain competitive and to keep customers happy.\n\nDistribution management is critical to a company's ability to successfully attract customers and operate profitably. Executing it successfully requires effective\u00a0management of\u00a0the entire distribution process. The larger a corporation, or the greater the number of supply points a company has, the more it will need to rely on automation to effectively manage thedistribution process.\n\nModern distribution management encompasses more than just\u00a0moving\u00a0products from point A to point B.\u00a0It also involves\u00a0gathering\u00a0and\u00a0sharing relevant information\u00a0that can be used to identify key opportunities for growth and competitiveness in the market.\u00a0Most progressive companies now use their distribution forces to obtain market intelligence which is vital in assessing their competitive position.\n\nThere are basically two types of distribution: commercial distribution (commonly known as sales distribution) and physical distribution (better\u00a0known as logistics).\u00a0Distribution\u00a0involves diverse functions such as customer service, shipping, warehousing,inventory control, private trucking-fleet operations, packaging, receiving, materials handling, along with plant, warehouse, store location planning, and the integration of information.\n\nThe goal is to achieve ultimate efficiency\u00a0in\u00a0delivering raw materials and parts, both partially and completely finished products to the right place and time in the proper condition. Physical distribution planning should align with\u00a0the overall channel strategy.\n\nAside from keepingprofitsup, there are many reasons a company may want to use a distribution management strategy. First, it keeps things organized. If there was no proper management system in place, retailers would be forced to hold stock in their own locations\u2014a bad idea, especially if the seller lacks proper storage space.\n\nA distribution management system also makes things easier for the consumer. It allows them to visit one location for a variety of different products. If the system didn't exist, consumers would have to visit multiple locations just to get what they need.\n\nPutting a proper distribution management system in place also alleviates any potential for errors in delivery, as well as the times products need to be delivered.\n\nBusinesses can adopt distribution management strategies through electronic platforms, which can help simplify the process and boost product sales.\n\nThe fundamental idea of distribution management\u00a0as a marketing function is that\u00a0the management of distribution happens in anecosystemthat also involves the consideration of the following:\n\nEffective distribution management involves\u00a0selling your product while assuring\u00a0sufficient stocks in channels while\u00a0managing promotions in those channels and their varying requirements.

The process includes warehousing, inventory management, packing, shipping, and delivery.\n\nDistribution channels are the intermediaries through which goods or services pass on their way to the final buyer or\u00a0consumer. The main channels include wholesalers, retailers, distributors, and in some cases, the internet.",
