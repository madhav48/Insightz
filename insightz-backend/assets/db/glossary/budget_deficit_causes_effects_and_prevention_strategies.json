  "term": "Budget Deficit: Causes, Effects, and Prevention Strategies",
  "definition": "A budget deficit occurs when\u00a0government expenses\u00a0exceedrevenue. Many people use it as an indicator of the financial health of a country. It is a term more commonly used to refer togovernment spending and receiptsrather than businesses or individuals.\n\nBudget deficits affect thenational debt, the sum of annual budget deficits, and the cumulative total a country owes to creditors.\n\nWhen a budget deficit is identified, current expenses exceed the income received through standard operations. To correct its nation's budget deficit, often referred to as afiscal deficit, a government may cut back on certain expenditures or increase revenue-generating activities.\n\nA budget deficit can lead to higher levels of borrowing, higher interest payments, and low reinvestment, which will result in lower revenue during the following year.\n\nThe opposite of\u00a0a budget deficit is abudget surplus.When a surplus occurs, revenue exceeds current expenses, resulting in\u00a0excess funds that can be further allocated. When the inflows equal the outflows, the budget is\u00a0considered balanced.\n\nIn the early 20th century, few industrialized countries had large fiscal deficits; however, during the First World War, deficits grew as governments borrowed heavily and depleted financial reserves to finance the war and their growth. These wartime and growth deficits continued until the 1960s and 1970s, when world economic growth rates dropped.\n\nBoth levels of taxation and spending affect a government's budget deficit. Common scenarios that create deficits by reducing revenue and increasing spending include:\n\nBudget deficits may occur as a way to respond to certain unanticipated events and policies, such as the increase in defense spending after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nBudget deficits affect individuals, businesses, and the overall economy. As the government takes steps to improve the deficit, spending for programs such as Medicare or Social Security may be curtailed. Improvements to infrastructure may also be affected.\n\nTo increase revenue, tax hikes may occur for high-income earners or large corporations, which may affect their ability to invest in new business ventures or hire new employees.\n\nCountries counter budget deficits bypromoting economic growth through fiscal policies, such as\u00a0reducing government spending and increasing taxes. Determining the best strategies regarding which spending to cut or whose taxes to raise are often widely debated.\n\nTo pay for government programs while operating under a deficit, the federal government borrows money by selling U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, and other securities.\n\nA federal budget deficit occurs when governmentspending outpaces revenueor income from taxes, fees, and investments. Deficits add to the national debt or federal government debt. If government debt grows faster than gross domestic product (GDP), the debt-to-GDP ratio may balloon, possibly indicating a destabilizing economy.\n\nThe last time the U.S. government had a federal budget surplus was in 2001. In every year since there has been a federal\u00a0budget deficit.\n\nThe government can work to cut back the budget deficit by using its fiscal policy toolbox to promote economic growth, such as scaling back government spending and raising taxes.\n\nBudget deficits, reflected as a percentage ofGDP, may decrease in times of economic prosperity, as increased tax revenue, lower unemployment rates, and increased economic growth reduce the need for government-funded programs such as unemployment insurance.\n\nBudget deficits are a negative balance between a government's spending and revenues. When a government spends more than it collects in tax revenues, there is a deficit. Conversely, if there is more collected than spent, there is a surplus.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Confronting Budget Deficits.\" Page 2.\n\nCrawford, Neta C. \"United States Budgetary Costs and Obligations of Post-9/11 Wars Through FY2020: $6.4 Trillion.\"Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs, November 2019, pp. 1-2, 7.\n\nFiscalData. \"What is the National Debt?\"\n\nFiscalData. \"What is the National Deficit?\"",
