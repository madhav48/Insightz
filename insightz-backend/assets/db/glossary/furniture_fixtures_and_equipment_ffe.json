  "term": "Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment (FF&E)",
  "definition": "Furniture, fixtures, and equipment (abbreviated as FF&E or FFE) refers to movable furniture, fixtures, or other equipment that have no permanent connection to the structure of a building. These items, which include desks, chairs, computers, electronic equipment, tables, bookcases, and partitions, typically depreciate substantially over their long-term use but are nevertheless important costs to consider when valuing a company,especially during liquidation events.\n\nThese items are sometimes referred to as furniture, fixtures, and accessories (FF&A).\n\nAn assetis classified as FF&E if it's used by a business for normal daily operations. For example, an office receptionist relies on their desk, chair, telephone, computer, desk organizer, and pen holder to conduct routine activities throughout the normal course of doing business.\n\nAccountants categorize FF&E astangible assets, under separate line items on financial statements and other budgeting documents. The FF&E balance is then added into a project's total costs to determine if an initiative comes in over or under budget.\n\nAccountants spread the acquisition costs of FF&E items over time by steadilydepreciatingtheir values over their lives. But to accomplish this, accountants must first correctly determine theuseful lifeof each item, based on IRS guidelines.\n\nAlthough FF&E items typically have useful lives ofone year or more, they may vary substantially, from one item to the next. For example, while a desktop computer may be deemed technologically outdated after three years, according to the IRS, it has a useful life of five years. On the contrary, the IRS assigns office furniture a useful life of seven years.\n\nSecurity equipment, such as X-ray scanners, may be considered FF&E, because these items may be removed from a building's premises and placed elsewhere.\n\nLet's assume anewcar is worth $10,000, and it has a useful life of five years, according to the IRS.Let's further assume that the vehicle's maximum salvage value is 20%. When a company first buys the car, it records the monthly depreciation charge as follows:\n\nThe depreciation charge is $133.33 at the end of the first month. Thenet book valueof the car is calculated as the difference between the original book value and the amount of its accumulated depreciation over its useful life.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Financial Accounting Manual for Federal Reserve Banks, January 2022: Chapter 3.
