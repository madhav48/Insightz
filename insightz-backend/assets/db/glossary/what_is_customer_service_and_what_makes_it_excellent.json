  "definition": "Customer service is the support, assistance, and advice provided by a company to its customers both before and after they buy or useits products or services. Customer service is a critical factor in ensuring buyer satisfaction. It also helps a company retain customers and grow its business.\n\nAt most companies,customer service representativesare the only employees who have direct contact with buyers or users. The buyers' perceptions of the company and the product are shaped in part by their experience in dealing with that person. This is why many companies work hard to increase customer satisfaction levels.\n\nSuccessful small businessesand large companies alike understand the need for excellent customer service instinctively. Here are the key components of excellent customer service:\n\nCustomer service should be a one-stop process for the consumer whenever possible.\n\nThere are many reasons why it's a good idea to invest in excellent customer service. The following are just some of the main benefits of implementing a customer service program within a company:\n\nIt isn't enough to have a customer service plan in place. The plan needs to be effectively executed to reap the benefits. But before we look at what effective execution looks like, it's important to understand bad customer service.\n\nBad customer service is any communication or experience where a consumer feels as though they are let down. This includes negative experiences, such as long wait or hold times, not being able to speak to an agent, being transferred too many times, and not being heard. This can lead customers to provide negative reviews and/or begin shopping with a competitor.\n\nThere are a few key traits that businesses can apply to their customer service to make it a better experience.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that job growth for customer service representatives will decline by 5% between 2023 and 2033.\n\nStudies of customer service have centered on creating the perfectonline experience. The first and most difficult factor is the multiplicity of channels. Today's customers expect to get service through whatever app or device they happen to be using at the moment.\n\nOnce again, the focus has been on packaging how-to content and related resources that are designed for self-service. Increasinglysophisticated data analyticsalso are being used to identify dissatisfied or low-engagement customers. But, as always, the most effective customer service needs to incorporate human contact, if only as a last resort.\n\nThere are a number of different channels to deliver customer service. Many companies, especially larger ones, offer more than one way for consumers to reach them. Smaller businesses may use one or just a few of them. And in the age of social media, it's become even easier to get in touch with businesses.\n\nThe following chart highlights some of the most common customer service channels companies use.\n\nFor decades, businesses in many industries have sought to reduce personnel costs by automating their processes to the greatest extent possible.\n\nThis led many companies to implement systems online and by phone that answer as many questions or resolve as many problems as they can without a human presence. But in the end, there are customer service issues for which human interaction is indispensable, creating acompetitive advantage.\n\nAmazon is an example of a company that is trying to automate a vast and complex operation. Nevertheless, Amazon still offers 24-hour customer service by phone, in addition to email and live chat services.\n\nMost successful businesses recognize the importance\u00a0of providing outstanding customer service. Courteous and empathetic interaction with a trained customer service representative can mean the difference between losing or retaining a customer.\n\nMuch is expected of customer service representatives, yet the pay is modest. The estimatedmedianannual compensation is $44,000 as of 2024.\n\nHere are some of the job expectations.\n\nHaving a good customer service plan in place leads to more sales, increases brand loyalty, generates referrals, helps retain customers, and provides businesses with a competitive advantage over others in the same industry.\n\nEffective customer service agents are skilled at listening and being empathetic. They're also very good at problem-solving and being proactive. It's also important for them to have a level of professionalism, which means that when things get heated, they can take a step back and not take anything to heart.\n\nSome of the ways to provide effective customer service include providing a friendly and warm experience, listening, and empathizing. It's also important for customers to feel as though their concerns and problems are valid and that they're being accommodated. Being proactive, not taking anything personally, and following up are also some examples of good customer service.\n\nHaving a customer service plan in place can make or break a company. Putting in a good plan with the right people, proper training, and appropriate channels can lead to more sales, customer loyalty, and referrals.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics. \"Customer Service Representative.\"\n\nGlassdoor. \"Customer Service Representative Salaries.\"",
