  "definition": "The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is an organization created by insurance regulators in the U.S. that establishes and sets standards for the nation's insurance industry.\n\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC)\u00a0is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that sets standards and establishes best practices for the insurance industry in the U.S. The NAIC also supports insurance regulators and provides resources for consumers. Founded in 1871, the organization is led by the chief insurance regulators of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five U.S. territories: American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.\n\nThe NAIC was founded in 1871 by state insurance regulators to address the need to \"coordinate regulation of multistate insurers. The first major step in that process was the development of uniform financial reporting by insurance companies.\"\n\nBecause insurers often do business in multiple states, the question of whether they should be regulated on a state or federal level has long been a matter of debate in the U.S. The 1944 Supreme Court caseUnited States v. The South-Eastern Underwriters Associationdetermined that the insurance industry should be subject to regulation by Congress under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, which gives lawmakers regulatory authority over interstate and international commerce. However, Congress effectively overrode that ruling the following year with the passage of the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulation, includingantitrust laws.\n\nToday, with few exceptions, that regulatory authority still resides with the states and their elected or appointed insurance commissioners.\n\nThe NAIC is headquartered in Kansas City, Mo., with executive offices in Washington, D.C.The group says its regulatory goals are to:\n\nThrough committees, task forces, and working groups, the NAIC develops model laws and regulations to help standardize insurance across the states. Its standing committees include life insurance and annuities, health insurance and managed care, property and casualty insurance, market regulation and consumer affairs, the financial condition of insurers, financial regulation standards and accreditation, and international insurance relations.\n\nThe NAIC and its committees normally meet three times a year. These meetings are generally open to the public.\n\nThe NAIC also offers education and training courses for insurance regulators. In 2006, it launched the Insurance Regulator Professional Designation Program and awarded its first professional designation the following year.\n\nThe NAIC website has a variety of resources consumers can use to learn about insurance products and check out complaint data on specific companies.\n\nIn addition to its work in support of state insurance regulators, the NAIC offers a number of tools for consumers. ItsConsumer Insurance Search toolhelps consumers research specific insurance companies, including anycomplaint data the NAIC has collected. Companies are scored on a national complaint index, which shows whether they've received more or fewer complaints than other insurers, after adjusting for market share.\n\nAccording to the NAIC's most recent aggregated data from state insurance departments, the majority of complaints in 2021 involved how an insurer handled policyholders' claims, withunsatisfactory settlements or offers, delayed claims, and denied claims collectively accounting for just over 50% of all complaints. Other types of complaints, though much lower on the list in terms of percentages, included high-pressure sales tactics, misleading advertising, and discrimination.\n\nFor consumers who would like to register a complaint of their own, the NAIC website also has aFile a Complaint tool, with links to state insurance departments for further information on the process.\n\nAlong with those consumer resources, the NAIC website offers basic information on life, health, homeowners, automobile, and several other types of insurance. It also has aLife Insurance Policy Locator tool, which consumers can use to request information on whether a deceased relative left behind an unclaimed policy.\n\nThe NAIC should not be confused with groups with similar acronyms: theNational Association of Investors Corp.or theNorth American Industry Classification System.\n\nNAIC. \"2021 Committee Structure.\"\n\nNAIC. \"Closed Confirmed Consumer Complaints by Reason.\"",
