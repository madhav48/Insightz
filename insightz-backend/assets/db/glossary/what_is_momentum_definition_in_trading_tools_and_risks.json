  "definition": "Jiwon Ma is a fact checker and research analyst with a background in cybersecurity, international security, technology, and privacy policies. Before joining Investopedia, she consulted for a global financial institution on cybersecurity policies and conducted research as a Research Analyst at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.\n\nMomentum is the rate of acceleration of asecurity'sprice\u2014that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam.\n\nSimply put, momentum refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time, usually taking into account both price and volume information. Intechnical analysis, momentum is often measured via anoscillatorand is used to help identify trends.\n\nThink of it as the momentum of a train: When a train starts up, as it accelerates, it moves very slowly. Once it gets up to speed, it stops accelerating but remains traveling at a higher velocity. At the end of the trip, the train decelerates as it slows down, but it can take many miles of track to apply the brakes before finally coming to a complete stop. For the momentum investor, the best part of the train ride is in the middle, when the train is moving at its highest velocity.\n\nMomentum investors like to chase performance. They attempt to achievealphareturns by investing in stocks that trend one way or another. Stocks trending up are referred to as hot stocks. Some are hotter than others (as measured by growth over a period of time). A stock that is trending down is cold.\n\nInvestorscan use momentum as a trading technique that seeks to profit from theherding behaviorof market psychology. Rather than \"buy low, sell high\", momentum trading follows a strategy of \"buy high, sell higher\". Once a momentum trader sees acceleration in a stock's price, earnings, or revenues, the trader will often take a long orshort positionin the stock in the hope that its momentum will continue in either an upward or downward direction. This strategy relies on short-term movements in a stock's price rather thanfundamental value.\n\nWhen applied, an investor can buy or sell based on thestrength of the trendsin an asset's price. If a trader wants to use a momentum-based strategy, he takes along positionin a stock or asset that has been trending up. If the stock is trending down, he takes ashort position. Instead of the traditional philosophy of trading\u2014buy low, sell high\u2014momentum investing seeks to sell low and buy lower, or buy high and sell higher. Instead of identifying the continuation orreversalpattern, momentum investors focus on the trend created by the most recent price break.\n\nSometools for momentum investorshelp to define the trend, such as the trend line. A trend line is a line drawn from the high price to the low price, or vice versa, over a given time period. If the line is up, the trend is up and the momentum investor buys the stock. If the trend line is down, the trend is down and themomentum investor sells the stock.\n\nIn this way, momentum investing is purely atechnical indicator. Though \"momentum\" can refer to fundamental measures of performance, such as revenue and earnings, it is most commonly used in reference to historical asset prices as a technical indicator.\n\nJust like any other trading style, there are risks that come with momentum trading. By using this technique, you should know that you are trading on the backs of other people in the market, and price trends are never guaranteed. And always be prepared for unexpected reversals or corrections that take place. This can happen because of unexpected news or changes in investor sentiment in the market.\n\nInvestor.gov. \u201cInvestor Alert: Thinking About Investing in the Latest Hot Stock?
