  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nUnemployment compensation is\u00a0paid by the state to unemployed workers who havelost their jobs due to layoffsor retrenchment. It is meant to provide a source of income for jobless workers until they can find employment. In order to be eligible for unemployment compensation, specific criteria must be satisfied, such as having worked for a minimum stipulated period and actively looking for a job.\n\nUnemployment compensation, generally provided by an unemployment check or a direct deposit, provides partial income replacement for a defined length of time or until the worker finds employment, whichever comes first. It is also known as \u201cunemployment benefits\u201d or \u201cunemployment insurance.\u201d\n\nUnemployment compensation is paid by many developed nations and some developing economies. In the United States, the\u00a0unemployment compensation system is jointly managed by the federal government and each individual state government. Benefits are based on a percentage of a worker\u2019s average pay over a recent 52-week period, and their calculation can vary by state.\n\nBenefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes paid by employers.Most states provide benefits for 26 weeks, though this varies by state and can go as low as 12 and as high as 30.Extensions are possible during periods of high unemployment.\n\nAs noted above, both the federal government and the individual states manage unemployment insurance in the United States.\n\nRequirements vary by state in terms of how benefits are determined. To be eligible in New York, for example, you must have worked and been paid wages in two calendar quarters, been paid at least $2,600 in one calendar quarter, and the total wages paid to you must be at least 1.5 times the amount paid to you in your high quarter.\u00a0The minimum benefit is $104 per week, and themaximum benefitis $504 per week.\n\nNew York and many other states waived the seven-day waiting period for benefits for people who are out of work due to coronavirus (COVID-19) closures or quarantines.\n\nOn March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law a\u00a0$2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package called theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.It temporarily expanded unemployment insurance benefits through three initiatives:\n\nHere is a quick summary of how they compare:\n\nPresident Joe Biden signed theAmerican Rescue Plan, a stimulus package worth $1.9 trillion on March 11, 2021, which provided additional benefits to Americans because of the COVID-19 pandemic.The bill extended unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs because of the pandemic from March 14, 2021, to Sept. 6, 2021.The new law extended the PUA by an additional 29 weeks from 50 to 79 weeks.It also pushed PEUC benefits from a total of 24 to 53 weeks.\n\nAll unemployment benefits and compensation related to the pandemic ended on Sept. 6, 2021.\n\nThe first unemployment compensation system was introduced in the\u00a0United Kingdom\u00a0with the\u00a0National Insurance Act of 1911\u00a0under the\u00a0Liberal Party\u00a0government of\u00a0H.H. Asquith. The measures were intended to counteract\u00a0the increasing footprint\u00a0of the\u00a0Labour Party\u00a0among the country\u2019s working-class population.\n\nThe National Insurance Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment; however, it only applied to wage earners. The\u00a0families of wage earners and those earning non-wage income\u00a0had to rely on other sources of support. Communists\u2014who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution\u2014criticized\u00a0the benefit, but employers and\u00a0Tories saw it as a \u201cnecessary evil.\u201d\n\nThe British unemployment compensation\u00a0scheme was based onactuarialprinciples, and it was funded by a fixed amount\u00a0contributed by\u00a0workers, employers,\u00a0and taxpayers. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible to receive seven shillings per week for up to 15 weeks in a year. However, the benefits\u00a0were\u00a0restricted to particular industries that tended to have more volatile employment requirements, such as\u00a0shipbuilding, and it did not make provision for any dependents.By 1913, about 2.5 million people were insured under the British scheme for unemployment benefits.\n\nIn the United States, unemployment compensation began at the state level when Wisconsin enacted it in 1932 to assuage the effect of theGreat Depression. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act and established it nationwide. Initially, employers of fewer than eight employees were exempt from having the coverage. That number dropped to four in 1954 and was reduced to one in 1970.\n\nThe system is calledEmployment Insurance(EI) in Canada and is funded by premiums paid by both employers and employees. Canada\u2019s first national unemployment system was established in 1940 by the Unemployment Insurance Act, also prompted by the effects of the Great Depression.\n\nThe law was expanded and liberalized in 1971 and finally replaced in 1996 by the Employment Insurance Act, which changed the program\u2019s name to emphasize that it intends to promote employment rather than support unemployment.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"How Do I File for Unemployment Insurance?\" Accessed Sept. 10, 2021.\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"Policy Basics: How Many Weeks of Unemployment Compensation Are Available?\" Accessed Sept. 10, 2021.\n\nCongress.gov. \"H.R. 1319\u2014American Rescue Plan Act,\" Page 115.
