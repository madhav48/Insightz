  "definition": "On your path to find your calling, you face questions. What software skills do you need? How do I ace an interview? Do I need an advanced degree?\n\nOne of the best resources for receiving career guidance are career centers. College campuses usually have career centers that both students and (typically) alumni can access at any time for free. In addition to private career centers, the U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration (ETA) also runs nearly 2,500 American Job Centers, which provide a wide variety of career services at no cost.Other sources of career advice can include speaking with experienced professionals in your chosen field and regularly meeting with a career mentor.\n\nWhile there is no one path to finding your dream job, a good way to start is by identifying your skill sets as well as your goals, passions, and values. Once you know what you can do and what\u2019s important to you, the next step should be gathering information on any careers of interest by talking with career mentors or (where possible) shadowing, temping, or interning at pertinent companies. Even if you can\u2019t find your ideal job with these practices right away, you\u2019ll still build a network that can also help you find a career you\u2019ll love.\n\nThere are several signs to look out for when considering if your career isn\u2019t the right fit for you. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is that your skills and knowledge are ill-suited for the work itself. Even if you are qualified for your position, if you regularly find yourself dreading the workweek, are completely disengaged from your tasks, and/or are constantly stressed, then it might be time to think about a career change.\n\nDetermining what you\u2019re skilled in is largely a process of reflecting upon both your past as well as present day work experience. Consider what tasks you excell(ed) at in your current or most recent job and what skills are/were required to do so. It\u2019s also worth talking to your current or past coworkers, analyzing your performance review(s), and reaching out to anyone else who knows you well, as other people are often able to identify positive things about us that we\u2019re unable to perceive.\n\nCertified Trust and Fiduciary Advisor (CTFA) is a professional designation indicating the holder is an expert in the trust and financial advising profession. Awarded by the American Bankers Association (ABA), receiving the CTFA designation requires a minimum level of experience in the wealth management industry, completing certain training programs, and passing an exam.\n\nCertified Treasury Professional (CTP) is a financial designation indicating the holder is an expert in cash management. Awarded by the Association for Financial Professionals (AFP), receiving the CTP designation requires a minimum level of experience in cash/treasury management or corporate finance, in addition to passing an exam.\n\n\u201cTermination of employment\u201d refers to the departure of an employee from their job, whether voluntarily or as a result of being fired. If an employee is not actively working due to an illness, leave of absence, or furlough, they are still considered employed if they have not been issued a notice of termination.\n\nA resume is a formal document detailing the background, skills, and accomplishments of a person applying for a job. Resumes are frequently rewritten to suit each individual position and reflect an individual\u2019s most recent activities.\n\nA cover letter is a letter of introduction that is typically attached to or included with a resume as part of a job application. The cover letter is intended to provide specific details on an applicant's credentials and what makes them qualified for the job in question.\n\n\u201cTechnical job skills\u201d refers to abilities that are typically learned and practiced and are useful for accomplishing specific tasks. These differ from skills that are tied to a person\u2019s character traits and interpersonal abilities, as they can be measured via an aptitude test.\n\nA vocational degree is an academic certificate indicating an individual is prepared to work a specific job or career. Vocational degrees often take less time to complete than an associate or bachelor\u2019s degree, though what curriculums qualify for a vocational degree can vary by state.\n\nA relationship manager is a member of a business\u2019 sales team who builds, maintains, and improves relationships with its clients and/or customers. Being a good relationship manager requires good communication, conflict management, and people skills, in addition to knowledge about the technical aspects of the relevant business or industry.\n\nBecome. \"Career Centers 101.\"https://www.learnhowtobecome.org/career-resource-center/making-the-most-of-career-centers/",
