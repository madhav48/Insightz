  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nBrexit is a portmanteau of the words \u201cBritish\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d that was coined to refer to the United Kingdom\u2019s decision in a June 23, 2016, referendum to leave theEuropean Union (EU). Brexit took place at 11 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time on Jan. 31,\u00a02020.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2020, the U.K. and the EU struck a provisional free-trade agreement ensuring the free trade of goods without tariffs or quotas. However, key details of the future relationship remain uncertain, such as trade in services, which make up 80% of the U.K. economy.\u00a0This prevented a no-deal Brexit, which would have been significantly damaging to the U.K. economy.\n\nA provisional agreement was approved by the U.K. parliament on Jan. 1, 2021. It was approved by the European Parliament on April 28, 2021. While the deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), allowed tariff- and quota-free trade in goods, U.K.-EU trade still faces customs checks. This means that commerce is not as smooth as when the U.K. was a member of the EU.\n\nThe Leave side won the June 2016 referendum with 51.9% of the ballot, or 17.4 million\u00a0votes, while Remain received 48.1% or 16.1 million votes. Voter turnout was 72.2%. The results were tallied on a U.K.-wide basis, but the overall figures conceal stark regional differences: 53.4% of English voters supported Brexit, compared to just 38% of Scottish voters.\n\nBecause England accounts for the vast majority of the U.K.\u2019s population, support there swayed the result in Brexit\u2019s favor. If the vote were conducted only in Wales (where Leave voters also won), Scotland, and Northern Ireland, Brexit would have received less than 45% of the vote.\n\nThe result defied expectations\u00a0and roiled global markets, causing theBritish poundto fall to its lowest level against the dollar in 30 years.\n\nFormer Prime Minister David Cameron, who called the referendum and campaigned for the U.K. to remain in the EU, announced his resignation the following day. He was replaced as leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister by Theresa May in July 2016.\n\nThe process of leaving the EU formally began on March 29, 2017, when May triggeredArticle 50of the Lisbon Treaty. The U.K. initially had two years from that date to negotiate a new relationship with the EU.\n\nFollowing a snap election on June 8, 2017, May remained the country\u2019s leader. However, the\u00a0Conservatives lost their outright majority in Parliament and agreed on a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party. This later caused May some difficulty getting her Withdrawal Agreement passed in Parliament.\n\nTalks\u00a0began on June 19, 2017. Questions swirled around the process, partly because Britain\u2019s constitution is unwritten and\u00a0because no country had left the EU using Article 50 before. A similar move happened, though, when Algeria left the EU\u2019s predecessor after gaining independence from France in 1962, and Greenland, which was a self-governing territory, left Denmark through a special treaty\u00a0in 1985.\n\nOn Nov. 25, 2018, Britain and the EU agreed on a 599-page Withdrawal Agreement, a Brexit deal that touched upon issues such as citizens\u2019 rights, the divorce bill, and the Irish border. Parliament first voted on this agreement on Jan. 15, 2019. Members of Parliament voted 432 to 202 to reject the agreement, the biggest defeat for a government in the House of Commons in recent history.\n\nMay stepped down as party leader on June 7, 2019, after failing three times to get the deal she negotiated with the EU approved by the House of Commons. The following month, Boris Johnson, a former mayor of London, foreign minister, and editor ofThe Spectator, was elected prime minister.\n\nJohnson, a hardline Brexit supporter, campaigned on a platform to leave the EU by the October deadline \u201cdo or die\u201d and said he was prepared to leave the EU without a deal. The U.K. and EU negotiators agreed on a new divorce deal on Oct. 17. The main difference from May\u2019s deal was that the Irish backstop clause was replaced with a new arrangement.\n\nAnother historic moment occurred in August 2019, when Johnson requested that the queen suspend Parliament from mid-September until Oct. 14, and she approved. This was seen as a ploy to stop members of Parliament from blocking a chaotic exit, and some even called it a coup of sorts. The U.K. Supreme Court\u2019s 11 judges unanimously deemed the move unlawful on Sept. 24 and reversed it.\n\nThe negotiating period also led Britain\u2019s political parties to face their own crises. Lawmakers left both the Conservative and Labour parties in protest. There were allegations of antisemitism in the Labour Party, and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was criticized for his handling of the issue. In September, Johnson expelled 21 MPs for voting to delay Brexit.\n\nThe U.K. was expected to leave the EU by Oct. 31, 2019, but Parliament voted to force the government to seek an extension to the deadline and delayed a vote on the new deal.\n\nJohnson then called for a general election. In the Dec. 12 election, the third general election in less than five years, Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party won a huge majority of 365 seats in the House of Commons out of 650 seats. It managed this despite receiving only 43.6% of the vote due to its opponents being fractured between multiple parties.\n\nBritain\u2019s lead negotiator in the talks with Brussels was\u00a0David Davis. He was a Yorkshire member of Parliament (MP) until July 9, 2018, when he resigned. He was replaced by housing minister Dominic Raab\u00a0as Brexit\u00a0secretary.\u00a0Raab resigned in protest over May\u2019s deal on Nov. 15, 2018. He was replaced by health and social care minister Stephen Barclay the following day.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief negotiator\u00a0was\u00a0Michel\u00a0Barnier, a French politician.\n\nPreparatory talks exposed divisions in the two sides\u2019 approaches to the process. The U.K. wanted to negotiate the terms of its withdrawal alongside the terms of its post-Brexit relationship with Europe, while Brussels wanted to make sufficient progress on divorce terms by October 2017, only then moving on to a trade deal. In a concession that both pro- and anti-Brexit commentators took as a sign of weakness, U.K. negotiators accepted the EU\u2019s sequenced approach.\n\nOne of the most politically thorny issues faced by Brexit negotiators was the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. and U.K. citizens living in the EU.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement allowed for the free movement of EU and U.K. citizens until the end of the transition or implementation period. Citizens were allowed to keep their residency rights if they continued to work, had sufficient resources, or were related to someone who did. To upgrade their residence status to permanent, they had to apply to the host nation. The rights of these citizens were revocable if Britain left without ratifying a deal.\n\n\u201cEU net migration, while still adding to the population as a whole, has fallen to a level last seen in 2009. We are also now seeing more EU8 citizens\u2014those from Central and Eastern European countries, for example, Poland\u2014leaving the U.K. than arriving,\u201d said Jay Lindop, director of the Centre for International Migration, in a government quarterly report released in February 2019.\n\nBritain\u2019s government fought over the rights of EU citizens to remain in the U.K. after\u00a0Brexit, publicly airing domestic divisions over migration. Following the referendum and Cameron\u2019s resignation, May\u2019s government concluded that it had the right under the \u201croyal prerogative\u201d to trigger Article 50 and begin the formal withdrawal process on its own.\n\nThe U.K. Supreme Court intervened, ruling that Parliament had to authorize the measure, and the House of Lords amended the resulting bill to guarantee the rights of\u00a0EU-born residents.The House of Commons, which had a Tory majority at the time, struck the amendment down, and the unamended bill became law on March 16, 2017.\n\nConservative opponents of the amendment argued that unilateral guarantees eroded Britain\u2019s negotiating position, while those in favor of it said EU citizens should not be used as bargaining chips.\n\nSome of the economic concerns included the fact that EU migrants were greater contributors to the economy than their U.K. counterparts. Leave supporters, though, read the data as pointing to foreign competition for scarce jobs in Britain.\n\nThe Brexit bill was the financial settlement that the U.K. owed\u00a0Brussels following its withdrawal.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement didn\u2019t mention a specific figure, but it was estimated to be up to \u00a332.8 billion, according to Downing Street. The total sum included the financial contribution that the U.K. would make during the transition period because it was an EU member state and owed a contribution toward the EU\u2019s outstanding 2020budgetcommitments.\n\nThe U.K. also received funding from EU programs during the transition period and a share of its assets at the end of it, which included the capital it paid to theEuropean Investment Bank (EIB).\n\nA December 2017 agreement\u00a0resolved this long-standing sticking point that threatened to derail negotiations entirely. Barnier\u2019s team launched the first volley in May 2017 with the release of a document listing the 70-odd entities it would take into account when tabulating the bill. The initial estimate of the bill was\u00a0\u20ac100 billion. Net of certain U.K. assets, the final bill would be \u20ac25 billion to \u20ac65 billion.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019 team, meanwhile, refused EU demands to submit the U.K.\u2019s preferred methodology for tallying the bill. In August, he told the BBC he would not commit to a figure by October, the deadline for assessing \u201csufficient progress\u201d on issues such as the bill.\n\nThe following month, he told the House of Commons that Brexit\u00a0bill negotiations could go on \u201cfor the full duration of the negotiation.\u201d\n\nDavis presented this refusal to the House of Lords as a negotiating tactic, but domestic politics probably explained his reticence. Johnson, who campaigned for Brexit, called EU estimates \u201cextortionate\u201d on July 11, 2017, and agreed with a Tory MP that Brussels could \u201cgo whistle\u201d if they wanted \u201ca penny.\u201d\n\nIn her September 2017 speech in Florence, Italy, however, May said the U.K. would \u201chonor commitments we have made during the period of our membership.\u201d Barnier confirmed to reporters in October 2019 that Britain would pay what was owed.\n\nThe new Withdrawal Agreement replaced the controversial Irish backstop provision with a protocol. According to the revised deal, the entire U.K. left the EU customs union upon Brexit, but Northern Ireland continued following EU regulations and value-added tax (VAT) laws for goods, while the U.K. government collected the VAT on behalf of the EU.\n\nThis meant there was a limited customs border in the Irish Sea with checks at major ports. The Northern Ireland assembly can vote on this arrangement up to four years after the end of the transition period.\n\nThe backstop emerged as the main reason for the Brexit impasse. It was a guarantee that there was no \u201chard border\u201d between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It was an insurance policy that kept Britain in the EU customs union with Northern Ireland following EU single-market rules.\n\nThe backstop, which was meant to be temporary and was superseded by a subsequent agreement, could only be removed if both Britain and the EU gave their consent.\n\nMay was unable to garner enough support for her deal due to it. Euroskeptic MPs wanted her to add legally binding changes, as they feared it would compromise the country\u2019s autonomy and could last indefinitely. EU leaders refused to remove it and ruled out a time limit on granting Britain the power to remove it. On March 11, 2019, the two sides signed a pact in Strasbourg, France, that did not change the Withdrawal Agreement but added \u201cmeaningful legal assurances.\u201d But it wasn\u2019t enough to convince hardline Brexiteers.\n\nFor decades during the second half of the\u00a020th century, violence between Protestants and Catholics marred Northern Ireland and the border between the U.K. countryside and the Republic of Ireland to the south was militarized. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement\u00a0turned the border almost invisible, except for speed limit signs, which switch from miles per hour in the north to kilometers per hour in the south.\n\nNegotiators in the U.K. and EU worried about the consequences of reinstating border controls, as Britain had to do in order to end freedom of movement from the EU. Yet leaving the customs union without imposing customs checks at the Northern Irish border or between Northern Ireland and the rest of Britain left the door wide open forsmuggling. This significant and unique challenge was one of the reasons soft Brexit advocates cited in favor of staying in the EU\u2019s\u00a0customs union and perhaps its single market.\n\nThe issue was further\u00a0complicated by the Tories\u2019 choice of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party as a coalition partner. The party opposed the Good Friday Agreement and, unlike the Conservative leader at the time, campaigned for Brexit.\n\nUnder the Good Friday Agreement, the U.K. government was required to oversee Northern Ireland with \u201crigorous impartiality.\u201d That proved difficult for a government that depended on the cooperation of a party with an overwhelmingly Protestant support base\u00a0and historical connections to Protestant paramilitary groups.\n\nLeave voters based their support for Brexit on a variety of factors, including theEuropean debt crisis,\u00a0immigration, terrorism, and the perceived drag of Brussels\u2019 bureaucracy on the U.K. economy.\n\nBritain was wary of the European Union\u2019s projects, which Leave supporters felt threatened the U.K.\u2019s sovereignty; the country never opted into\u00a0the European Union\u2019s monetary union, meaning that it used the pound\u00a0instead of theeuro. It also remained outside the Schengen Area, meaning that it did not share open borders with a number of other European nations.\n\nOpponents of Brexit also cited a number of rationales for their position:\n\nA common thread in both arguments was that leaving the EU would destabilize the U.K. economy in the short term and make the country poorer in the long term.\n\nIn July\u00a02018, May\u2019s cabinet suffered another shake-up when Boris Johnson resigned as the U.K.\u2019s foreign minister and David Davis resigned as Brexit\u00a0minister over May\u2019s plans to keep close ties to the EU. Johnson was replaced by Jeremy Hunt, who favored a soft Brexit.\n\nSome state institutions backed the\u00a0Remain supporters\u2019 economic\u00a0arguments:Bank of Englandgovernor Mark Carney called Brexit \u201cthe biggest domestic risk to financial stability\u201d in March 2016, and the following month, the Treasury projected lasting damage to the economy under any of three possible post-Brexit scenarios:\n\nAdapted from \u201cH.M. Treasury analysis: The long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives,\u201d April 2016\n\nLeave supporters discounted such economic projections under the label \u201cProject Fear.\u201d A pro-Brexit outfit associated with the U.K. Independence Party (UKIP), which\u00a0was founded to oppose EU membership, responded by saying that the Treasury\u2019s \u201cworst-case scenario of \u00a34,300 per household is a bargain-basement price for the restoration of national independence and safe, secure borders.\u201d\n\nAlthough Leave supporters\u00a0stressed issues of national pride, safety, and sovereignty, they also mustered economic arguments. For example, Johnson said on the eve of the vote, \u201cEU politicians would be banging down the door for atrade deal\u201d the day after the vote, in light of their \u201ccommercial interests.\u201d\n\nVote Leave, the official pro-Brexit campaign, topped the \u201cWhy Vote Leave\u201d page on its website with the claim that the U.K. could save \u00a3350 million per week: \u201cWe can spend our money on our priorities like the NHS [National Health Service], schools, and housing.\u201d\n\nIn May 2016, the U.K. Statistics Authority, an independent public body, said the figure was gross rather than net, which was \u201cmisleading and undermines trust in official statistics.\u201d A mid-June poll by Ipsos MORI, however, found that 47% of the country believed the claim.\n\nThe day after the referendum, Nigel Farage, who co-founded\u00a0UKIP\u00a0and led it until that November, disavowed the figure and said that he was not closely associated with Vote Leave. May also declined to confirm Vote Leave\u2019s NHS promises since taking office.\n\nThough Britain officially left the EU, 2020 was a transition and implementation period. Trade and customs continued during that time, so there wasn\u2019t much on a day-to-day basis that seemed different to U.K. residents. Even so, the decision to leave the EU had an effect on Britain\u2019s economy.\n\nThe country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) growth slowed down to around 1.4% in 2018 from 1.9% in 2016 and 2.7% in 2017 as business investment slumped. TheInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)predicted that the country\u2019s economy would grow at 1.3% in 2019 and 1.4% in 2020. Instead, growth was 1.6% in 2019 but -10.4% in 2020. GDP rebounded, however, touching 8.7% in 2021 before slowing to 4.3% in 2022.\n\nThe U.K. unemployment rate hit a 44-year low at 3.9% in the three months leading up to January 2019. Experts attribute this to employers preferring to retain workers instead of investing in new major projects.\n\nWhile the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote helped exporters, the higher price of imports was passed onto consumers and had a significant impact on the annualinflationrate. Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation hit 3.1% in the 12 months leading up\u00a0to November 2017, a nearly six-year high that well exceeded the Bank of England\u2019s 2% target. Inflation fell in 2018 with the decline in oil and gas prices but soared after the global COVID-19 pandemic, rising 8.7% in the 12 months preceding April 2023.\n\nA July 2017 report by the House of Lords\u00a0cited evidence that U.K. businesses would have to raise wages to attract native-born workers following Brexit, which was \u201clikely to lead to higher prices for consumers.\u201d\n\nInternational trade was expected to fall due to Brexit, even with the possibility of a raft of free trade deals. Dr. Monique Ebell, former associate research director at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, forecasted a -22% reduction in total U.K. goods and services trade if EU membership\u00a0was replaced by a free trade agreement.\n\nOther free trade agreements were not predicted to pick up the slack. In fact, Ebell\u00a0saw a pact with the BRIICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, China, and South Africa) boosting total trade by 2.2% while a pact with the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand was expected to do slightly better, at 2.6%.\n\n\u201cThe single market is a very deep and comprehensive trade agreement aimed at reducing non-tariff barriers,\u201d Ebell wrote in January 2017,\u00a0\u201cwhile most non-EU [free trade agreements]\u00a0seem to be quite ineffective at reducing the non-tariff barriers that are important for services trade.\u201d\n\nOn April 18, May called for a snap election to be held on June 8, despite previous promises not to hold one until 2020. Polling at the time suggested May would expand on her\u00a0slim Parliament majority of 330 seats (there are 650 seats in the Commons). Labour gained rapidly in the polls, however, aided by an embarrassing Tory flip-flop on a proposal for estates to fund end-of-life care.\n\nThe Conservatives lost their majority, winning 318 seats to Labour\u2019s 262. The Scottish National Party won 35, with other parties taking 35. The resulting hung Parliament cast doubts on May\u2019s mandate to negotiate Brexit and led the leaders of Labour\u00a0and the Liberal Democrats to call on May to resign.\n\nSpeaking in front of the prime minister\u2019s residence at 10 Downing Street, May batted away calls for her to leave her post, saying, \u201cIt is clear that only the Conservative and Unionist Party\u201d\u2014the Tories\u2019 official name\u2014\u201chas the legitimacy and ability to provide that certainty by commanding a majority in the House of Commons.\u201d The Conservatives struck a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland, which won 10 seats, to form a coalition.\n\nMay presented the election as a chance for the Conservatives to solidify their mandate and strengthen their negotiating position with Brussels. But this backfired.\n\nIn the wake of the election, many expected the government\u2019s Brexit position to soften, and they were right. May released a Brexit white paper in July 2018 that mentioned an \u201cassociation agreement\u201d and a free-trade area for goods with the EU. David Davis resigned as Brexit secretary, and Boris Johnson resigned as Foreign Secretary in protest.\n\nBut the election also increased the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. TheFinancial Timespredicted that the result made May more vulnerable to pressure from Euroskeptics and her coalition partners. This was evident with the Irish backstop tussle.\n\nWith her position weakened, May struggled to unite her party behind her deal and keep control of Brexit.\n\nPoliticians in Scotland pushed for a second independence referendum in the wake of the Brexit vote, but the results of the June 8, 2017, election cast a pall over their efforts. The Scottish National Party (SNP) lost 21 seats in the Westminster Parliament, and on June 27, 2017, Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said her government at Holyrood would \u201creset\u201d its timetable on independence to focus on delivering a \u201csoft Brexit.\u201d\n\nNot one Scottish local area voted to leave the EU, according to the U.K.\u2019s Electoral Commission, though Moray came close at 49.9%. The country as a whole rejected the referendum by 62.0% to 38.0%.\n\nBut because Scotland only contains 8.4% of the U.K.\u2019s population, its vote to Remain (along with that of Northern Ireland, which accounts for just 2.8% of the U.K.\u2019s population) was vastly outweighed by support for Brexit in England and Wales.\n\nScotland joined England and Wales to form Great Britain in 1707, and the relationship has been tumultuous at times.The SNP, which was founded in the 1930s,\u00a0had just six of 650 seats in Westminster in 2010.The following year, however, it formed a majority government in the devolved Scottish Parliament at\u00a0Holyrood, partly owing to its promise to hold a referendum on Scottish independence.\n\nThat referendum, held in 2014, saw the pro-independence side lose with 44.7% of the vote. Turnout was 84.6%. Far from putting the independence issue to rest, though, the vote fired up nationalist support.\n\nThe SNP won 56 of 59 Scottish seats at Westminster the following year, overtaking the Liberal Democrats to become the third-largest party in the U.K. overall. Britain\u2019s electoral map suddenly showed a glaring divide between England and Wales, which was dominated by Tory blue with the occasional patch of\u00a0Labour red, and all-yellow Scotland.\n\nWhen Britain voted to leave the EU, Scotland fulminated. A combination of rising nationalism and strong support for Europe led almost immediately to calls for a new independence referendum. In 2017, when the Supreme Court ruled that devolved national assemblies such as Scotland\u2019s parliament could not veto Brexit, the demands grew louder.\n\nOn March 13 of that year, Sturgeon called for a second referendum to be held in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. Holyrood\u00a0backed her by a vote of 69 to 59 on March 28, the day before May\u2019s government triggered Article 50.\n\nSturgeon\u2019s preferred timing was significant since the two-year countdown initiated by Article 50 ended in the spring of 2019 when the politics surrounding Brexit could be particularly volatile.\n\nScotland\u2019s economic situation also raised questions about its hypothetical future as an independent country. The crash in oil prices dealt a blow to government finances. In May 2014, its government forecasted 2015\u20132016 tax receipts from North Sea drilling of \u00a33.4 billion to\u00a0\u00a39 billion but only collected\u00a0\u00a360 million, less than 1% of the forecasts\u2019 midpoint.\n\nIn reality, these figures were hypothetical since Scotland\u2019s finances were not (and are not) fully devolved, but the estimates were based on the country\u2019s geographical share of North Sea drilling, so they illustrated what it might expect as an independent nation.\n\nThe debate over what currency an independent Scotland would use was revived. Former SNP leader Alex Salmond, who was Scotland\u2019s First Minister until November 2014, told theFinancial Timesthat the country could abandon the pound and introduce its own currency, allowing it to float freely or pegging it to sterling. He ruled out joining the euro, but others contended that it would be required for Scotland to join the EU. Another possibility would be to use the pound, which would mean forfeiting control overmonetary policy.\n\nOn the other hand, a weak currency that floats on global markets can be a boon to U.K. producers that export goods. Industries that rely heavily on exports could actually see some benefit.\n\nIn 2024, the top 10 exports from the U.K. were (in U.S. dollars):\n\nSome sectors were prepared to benefit from the exit. Multinationals listed on theFTSE 100saw earnings rise as a result of a soft pound. A weak currency\u00a0was also a boon to the tourism, energy, and service industries.\n\nIn May 2016, the State Bank of India, India\u2019s largest commercial bank, suggested that Brexit would benefit India economically. While leaving the eurozone meant that the U.K. no longer had unfettered access to Europe\u2019s single market, it would allow for more focus on trade with India. India would also have more wiggle room if the U.K. were no longer under European trade rules and regulations.\n\nMay advocated a \u201chard Brexit.\u201d By that, she meant that Britain should leave the EU\u2019s single market and customs union and negotiate a\u00a0trade deal to govern their future relationship. These negotiations would have been conducted during a transition period once a divorce deal was ratified.\n\nThe Conservatives\u2019 poor showing in the June 2017 snap election called popular support for a hard Brexit into question. Many in the press speculated that the government could take a softer line. The Brexit White Paper released in July 2018 revealed plans for a softer Brexit. It was too soft for many MPs in her party and too audacious for the EU.\n\nThe white paper said the government planned to leave the EU single market and customs union. However, it proposed the creation of a free trade area for goods, which would \u201cavoid the need for customs and regulatory checks at the border and mean that businesses would not need to complete costly customs declarations. And it would enable products to only undergo one set of approvals and authorizations in either market, before being sold in both.\u201d This meant the U.K. would follow EU single-market rules regarding goods.\n\nThe white paperacknowledged that a borderless customs arrangement with the EU\u2014one that allowed the U.K. to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries\u2014was \u201cbroader in scope than any other that exists between the EU and a third country.\u201d\n\nThe government was correct that there was no example of this kind of relationship in Europe. The four broad precedents that existed were the EU\u2019s relationship with Norway, Switzerland, Canada, and WTO members.\n\nThe first option was for the U.K. to join Norway, Iceland, and Lichtenstein in theEuropean Economic Area (EEA), which provides access to the EU\u2019s single market for most goods and services (agriculture and fisheries are excluded). At the same time, the EEA is outside the customs union, so Britain could have entered into trade deals with non-EU countries.\n\nBut the arrangement was hardly a win-win. The U.K. would be bound by some EU laws while losing its ability to influence those laws through the country\u2019s European Council and European Parliament voting rights. In September 2017, May called this arrangement an unacceptable \u201closs of democratic control.\u201d\n\nDavid Davis expressed interest in the Norway model in response to a question he received at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019ve thought about, but it\u2019s not at the top of our list,\u201d he said. He was referring specifically to\u00a0the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), which, like the EEA, offers access to the single market but not the customs union.\n\nThe EFTA was once a large organization, but most of its members left to join the EU. Today, it comprises\u00a0Norway, Iceland, Lichtenstein, and Switzerland; all but Switzerland are also members of the EEA.\n\nSwitzerland\u2019s relationship with the EU, which is governed by around 20 major bilateral pacts with the bloc, is broadly similar to the EEA\u00a0arrangement. Along with these three, Switzerland is a member of the European Free Trade Association. Switzerland helped set up the EEA, but its people rejected membership in a 1992 referendum.\n\nThe country allows the free movement of people and is a member of the passport-free Schengen\u00a0Area.\u00a0It is subject to many single-market rules without having much say in making them.\n\nIt is outside the customs union, allowing it to negotiate free trade agreements with third countries; usually, but not always, it has negotiated\u00a0alongside the EEA countries. Switzerland\u00a0has access to the single market for goods (with the exception of agriculture) but not services (except insurance). It pays a modest amount into the EU\u2019s budget.\n\nBrexit\u00a0supporters who wanted to \u201ctake back control\u201d wouldn\u2019t have embraced the concessions that the Swiss made on immigration, budget payments, and single-market rules. The EU would probably not have wanted a relationship modeled on the Swiss example, either: Switzerland\u2019s membership in the EFTA but not the EEA, and Schengen but not the EU, is a messy product of the complex history of European integration and\u2014not surprisingly\u2014a referendum.\n\nA third option was to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU along the lines of\u00a0the\u00a0Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), a pact that the EU finalized but didn\u2019t fully ratify with Canada. The most obvious problem with this approach is that the U.K. had only two years from triggering Article 50 to negotiate such a deal. The EU refused to discuss a future trading relationship until December of that year at the earliest.\n\nTo give a sense of how tight that timetable was, CETA negotiations began in 2009 and concluded in 2014.But just over half of the EU\u2019s 28 national parliaments ratified the deal.Even subnational legislatures can stand in the way of a deal; the Walloon regional parliament, which represents fewer than four million mainly French-speaking Belgians, single-handedly blocked CETA\u00a0for a few days in\u00a02016.\n\nTo extend the two-year deadline for leaving the EU, Britain needed unanimous approval from the EU. Several U.K. politicians, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond, stressed the need for a transitional deal of a few years so that (among other reasons) Britain could negotiate EU and third-country trade deals. But this notion was met with resistance from hardline Brexiteers.\n\nAs of 2024, all EU member countries have signed the agreement yet some still need to ratify it, a process that can take two to five years.\n\nIn some\u00a0ways, comparing Britain\u2019s situation to Canada\u2019s is misleading. Canada already enjoys free trade with the U.S. through\u00a0the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which was built on theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). This means that a trade deal with the EU was not\u00a0as crucial\u00a0as it is\u00a0for the U.K. Canada\u2019s and Britain\u2019s economies are also very different\u2014CETA does not include financial services, one of Britain\u2019s biggest exports to the EU.\n\nSpeaking in Florence, Italy, in September 2017, May said the U.K. and EU \u201ccan do so much better\u201d than a CETA-style trade agreement since they were beginning from the \u201cunprecedented position\u201d of sharing a body of rules and regulations. She did not elaborate on what \u201cmuch better\u201d looked like besides calling on both parties\u00a0to be \u201ccreative as well as practical.\u201d\n\nMonique Ebell, formerly of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, stressed that even with an agreement in place, non-tariff barriers were likely to be a significant drag on Britain\u2019s trade with the EU. She expected total U.K. foreign trade\u2014not just flows to and from the EU\u2014under an EU-U.K. trade pact. She reasoned that free trade deals did not generally handle services trade well. Services are a major component of Britain\u2019s international trade;\u00a0the country enjoys a trade surplus in that segment, which is not the case for goods.\n\nFree trade deals also struggle to rein in non-tariffbarriers. Admittedly, Britain and the EU started from a unified regulatory scheme, but divergences would only multiply post-Brexit.\n\nIf Britain and the EU weren\u2019t able to agree their relationship, they would have had to revert to WTO terms. But this default solution wouldn\u2019t have been straightforward, either. Since Britain was a WTO member through the EU, it would have to split tariff schedules with the bloc and divvy out liabilities arising from\u00a0ongoing trade disputes.\n\nTrading with the EU on WTO terms was the \u201cno-deal\u201d scenario that the Conservative government presented as an acceptable fallback, though most observers see this as a negotiating tactic. In July 2017, U.K. Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox said, \u201cPeople talk about the WTO\u00a0as if it would be the end of the world. But they forget that is how they currently trade with the United States, with China, with Japan, with India, with the Gulf, and our trading relationship is strong and healthy.\u201d\n\nBut for certain industries, the EU\u2019s external tariff would have hit hard: Britain exports\u00a078.6% of the cars it manufactures, and 60% of these go to Europe.The EU levies 10% tariffs onimportedcars. Monique Ebell of the NIESR\u00a0estimated that leaving the EU single market would reduce overall U.K. goods and services trade\u2014not just that with the EU\u2014by 22% to 30%.\n\nNor would the U.K. only be giving up its trade arrangements with the EU; under any of the scenarios above, it would probably\u00a0have lost the trade agreements that the bloc struck with 63 developing countries, as well as progress in negotiating other deals. Replacing these and adding new ones would have been an uncertain prospect. In a September 2017 interview with Politico, Fox said his trade office, which was formed in July 2016, turned away some developing countries looking to negotiate free trade deals because it lacked\u00a0the capacity\u00a0to negotiate.\n\nFox wanted to roll the terms of existing\u00a0EU trade deals over into new agreements, but some countries were unwilling to give Britain (66 million people, $2.6 trillion GDP) the same terms as the EU\u00a0(excluding Britain, around 440 million people, $13.9 trillion GDP).\n\nCompanies in the U.S. across a wide variety ofsectorshave made large investments in the U.K. over many years. The U.S. hires a lot of Brits, making U.S. companies one of the U.K.\u2019s largest job markets. The output of U.S. affiliates in the United Kingdom was $129.3 billion in 2021.\n\nThe United Kingdom plays a vital role in corporate America\u2019s global infrastructure, fromassets under management (AUM)to international sales and research and development (R&D) advancements.\n\nAmerican companies have viewed Britain as a strategic gateway to other countries in the European Union. Brexit is believed to jeopardize the affiliate earnings and stock prices of many companies strategically aligned with the United Kingdom.\n\nAmerican companies and investors that have exposure to European banks and credit markets may be affected by credit risk. European banks may have to replace $123 billion in securities depending on how the exit unfolds. Furthermore, U.K. debt may not be included in European banks\u2019 emergencycash reserves, creating liquidity problems. Europeanasset-backed securitieshave been in decline since 2008.\n\nPolitical wrangling over the EU wasn\u2019t limited to Britain. Even following Britain\u2019s departure, most EU members had strong Euroskeptic movements that, while they struggled to win power at the national level, heavily influenced the tenor of national politics in the years that followed. There is still a chance that such movements could secure referendums on EU membership in a few countries at some point in the future.\n\nIn May 2016, global research firm\u00a0Ipsos\u00a0released a report showing that a majority of respondents in Italy and France believe their countries should hold a referendum on EU membership.\n\nThe fragile Italian banking sector has driven a wedge between the EU and the Italian government,\u00a0which provided bailout funds to save mom-and-pop bondholders from being \u201cbailed in,\u201d as EU rules stipulate. The government abandoned its 2019 budget when the EU threatened it with sanctions. It lowered its planned budget deficit from 2.5% of GDP to 2.04%.\n\nMatteo\u00a0Salvini, the far-right head of Italy\u2019s Northern League and the country\u2019s deputy prime minister, called for a referendum on EU membership hours after the Brexit vote, saying, \u201cThis vote was a slap in the face for all those who say that Europe is their own business and Italians don\u2019t have to meddle with that.\u201d\n\nThe Northern League has an ally in the populist Five Star Movement, whose founder, former comedian\u00a0Beppe\u00a0Grillo, called for a referendum on Italy\u2019s membership in the euro\u2014though not the EU.\u00a0The two parties formed a coalition government in 2018 and made Giuseppe Conte prime minister.Conte ruled out the possibility of \u201cItalexit\u201d in 2018 during the budget standoff.\n\nMarine Le Pen, the leader of France\u2019s\u00a0Euroskeptic National Front, hailed the Brexit vote as a win for nationalism and sovereignty across Europe: \u201cLike a lot of French people, I\u2019m very happy that the U.K. people held on and made the right choice. What we thought was impossible yesterday has now become possible.\u201d She lost the French presidential election to Emmanuel Macron in May 2017, gaining just 33.9% of votes. He won the election again in 2022, beating Le Pen once more.\n\nMacron has warned that the demand for \u201cFrexit\u201d will grow if the EU does not see reforms. According to a 2020\u20132022 European Social Survey poll, 16% of French citizens want the country to leave the EU, down from 24.3% in a 2016\u20132017 poll.\n\nBritain officially left the EU on Jan. 31,\u00a02020, at 11 p.m. GMT. The move came after a referendum voted in favor of Brexit on June 23, 2016.\n\nThere were many reasons why Britain voted to leave the European Union. But some of the main issues behind Brexit included a rise in nationalism, immigration, political autonomy, and the economy. The Leave side garnered almost 52% of the votes, while the Remain side received about 48%.\n\nBritain\u2019s departure from the European Union left 27 member states. They are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.\n\nThe European Union was established in November 1993 with the Maastricht Treaty. The original members included Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Fifteen other countries would gain membership in the union.\n\nRising nationalist sentiment, coupled with concerns over the economy and British sovereignty, led the majority of voters in the U.K. to vote to leave the EU. Britain left the union at the end of January 2020 in what is commonly called Brexit. But the move didn\u2019t come without challenges. It required two years of negotiating a deal and a year-long transition period before everything became final.\n\nBBC. \u201cBrexit: What Is the Transition Period?\u201d\n\nThe New York Times. \u201cBrexit Trade Deal Gets a Final OK from E.U.
