  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe term \u201ctax benefit\u201d refers to any tax law that helps you reduce yourtax liability. Benefits range from deductions and tax credits to exclusions and exemptions. They cover various areas, including programs for families, education, employees, and natural disasters.\n\nSome tax benefits are related to the ability to pay taxes. For example, theChild Tax Creditand theearned income tax credit (EITC)recognize the cost of raising a family. Other tax benefits, including mortgage interest and charitable donation deductions, are incentives designed to further social policy goals.\n\nTax benefits help individuals and corporations reduce their overall tax bills. These benefits are a significant part of the tax regulations and legislation set by local, state, and federal governments.\n\nTax benefits such asdeductions, credits, exemptions, and exclusions reduce the amount you owe annually to federal and state governments.\n\nOn the other hand,tax sheltershelp lower taxes through particular investments. These are legal vehicles that provide favorable tax treatment. Common examples of tax shelters includemunicipal bondsand employer-sponsored401(k)plans.\n\nYou must be eligible for tax benefits to claim them. For instance, to qualify forhead of householdstatus, you must be unmarried, have a qualifying dependent who lives with you, and pay more than half of the household expenses for the year.\n\nTax benefits foreducational expensescan only be claimed by those who spend money on tuition and other related costs during the tax year.\n\nIt makes financial sense to learn about any tax benefits you might be eligible for. Without the proper knowledge, you could end up paying more in taxes than you owe. It can be helpful to consult a tax professional, such as anaccountant, to maximize your tax savings.\n\nAs noted above, tax benefits come in all shapes and sizes. We\u2019ve highlighted some of the more common ones below.\n\nA\u00a0tax deduction\u00a0reduces your\u00a0taxable income. When you file your annual income tax return, you have the option to take the standard deduction or to itemize your deductions:\n\nItemizing your deductions makes sense if the sum of your qualified expenses is greater than your standard deduction. For example, if a single taxpayer\u2019s itemized expenses total $15,000, they would likely itemize rather than take the $13,850 standard deduction. However, if the same filer\u2019s qualified expenses total just $8,000, they would save money by taking the standard deduction.\n\nEven if you don\u2019t itemize, you can take certainabove-the-line deductionsalong with the standard deduction. These include deductions for student loan interest, traditionalindividual retirement account (IRA)contributions, contributions to Health Savings Accounts, and more. All these deductions lower taxes by reducing taxable income and possibly lowering your tax bracket.\n\nSay, for example, that a single filer has $49,000 oftaxable incomefor the 2024 tax year, landing them in the\u00a022%\u00a0marginaltax bracket. Therefore, they would pay 22% on any income over $47,150 (the beginning of the 22% tax bracket).\n\nHowever, if they qualify for $2,000 in above-the-line tax deductions, they will be taxed on $49,000 - $2,000 = $47,000, giving them a marginal tax rate of 12% for tax year 2024.\n\nTax deductions often reduce the total amount ofincomeearned by businesses. Most companies use a standard income statement to calculate their taxable obligations, with taxation falling on the last line.\n\nTax credits also save you money, but they work differently from deductions. Atax creditis applied to the amount of tax you owe after all tax calculations are made. For example, if you owe $3,000 after taking deductions and calculating taxes with yourmarginal tax rate, a $1,000 credit would reduce your tax bill to $2,000.\n\nThere are many types of tax credits available for individuals and businesses. For individuals, some of the most common tax credits include the Child Tax Credit, the EITC, and thepremium tax credit.\n\nTax credits are either refundable or nonrefundable. Arefundable tax creditresults in a refund check if the tax credit exceeds your tax bill. For example, say you apply a $3,400 tax credit to your $3,000 tax bill. Your bill would be reduced to zero, and you would receive the remaining portion of the credit as a refund. In this case, that refund would be $400.\n\nAnonrefundable tax creditdoes not result in a refund because it only reduces the tax owed to zero. Using the example above, if the $3,400 tax credit were nonrefundable, you would owe nothing to the government but would forfeit the $400 that remains after the credit is applied.\n\nSome examples of nonrefundable tax credits include thesaver\u2019s credit, adoption credit, child care credit, andmortgage interesttax credits.\n\nTax credits do not impact your taxable income or marginal tax bracket. They are subtracted from your tax bill to directly reduce the amount of tax you owe.\n\nTheTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA)suspended the personaltax exemptionfor 2018 through 2025, but some tax exclusions still apply.\n\nTax exclusions usually arise in pretax payments that help you lower your taxable bottom line. Income excluded for tax purposes usually does not show up on your tax return at all.\n\nOne of the most common exclusions is the employer-basedhealth insurancepayment program. If an employer takes healthcare payments on a pretax basis, an employee\u2019s\u00a0taxable income\u00a0is lowered at the end of the pay period, which reduces the amount of tax owed.\n\nThe annual gift tax exclusion is $18,000 for 2024 and increases to $19,000 for 2025. You can gift up to that amount tax free to as many people as you wish without using up any of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.\n\nA tax shelter provides a variety of tax advantages. It is generally a vehicle with lower or no tax requirements if you abide by the contracted terms.\n\nOne of the most popular tax shelters is the 401(k). That\u2019s because income is sheltered from a higher tax rate during investors\u2019 higher-earning years compared to inretirement, when their income (and tax rate) is lower.\n\nTax havenscan also be a type of tax shelter. These are often used by businesses. Companies may incorporate in certain regions to lower their business tax bill. Some of the most popular tax havens include Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands.\n\nNot all tax shelters are legal and legitimate. The IRS treatsillegal tax sheltersas fraudulent activities. Taxpayers who use illegal tax schemes may face penalties, criminal prosecution, and prison time.\n\nCertain investment productsmay offer a tax shelter or tax exemption in and of themselves.\n\nMunicipal bonds, for example, are exempt from federal and state taxes if aligned with the state in which the bondholder lives.\n\nOthertax-advantagedinvestments includetax-free savings accounts, municipalmutual fundsorexchange-traded funds (ETFs), and somelife insurancepolicies.\n\nTax credits and tax deductions both reduce the amount of tax you owe, but they work in different ways. Tax credits directly lower the amount of tax you owe, while tax deductions decrease your taxable income.\n\nSay you\u2019re eligible for a $1,000 tax credit and a $1,000 tax deduction. The tax credit reduces your tax bill by $1,000. So, if you owed $1,500 in taxes and then took a $1,000 credit, your tax bill would be $500 ($1,500 - $1,000). On the other hand, the tax deduction reduces your taxable income by $1,000. So, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, the $1,000 deduction would save you $220 ($1,000 \u00d7 22%). Tax credits are more favorable because they save you more money than tax deductions.\n\nThe estate tax is the amount below which a decedent\u2019s estate is not subject to taxes. For 2024, the exemption is $13.61 million. For 2025, it increases to $13.99 million.\n\nThe earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit for low- and moderate-income households. If you\u2019re eligible for the EITC, the amount you receive depends on your filing status, income, and the number of dependents you can claim. For 2024, the maximum earned income tax credit is $632 if you have no dependents, $4,213 for one dependent, $6,960 for two dependents, and $7,830 for three or more dependents. These amounts increase to $649, $4,328, $7,152, and $8,046, respectively, for 2025.\n\nIt\u2019s important to know where you stand with respect to your tax bill even if it isn\u2019t tax season. Keeping on top of the tax benefits that apply to you can spell the difference between a refund and an unwelcome tax bill\u2014or at least breaking even when it comes time to file.\n\nThese benefits range from tax credits and deductions to exclusions and exemptions. Be sure to speak to a tax professional if you\u2019re unsure about how they may work for you.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCredits and Deductions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTax Exempt Bonds.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Plan Overview.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 501, Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cEducation Credits\u2014AOTC and LLC.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cAbout Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cChild Tax Credit.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cThe Premium Tax Credit\u2014The Basics.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCredits and Deductions for Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPersonal Exemptions,\u201d Page 5-1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cWhat Is Taxable and Nontaxable Income?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cSmall Business Health Care Tax Credit Questions and Answers: How to Claim the Credit.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cFrequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service Reports. \u201cTax Havens: International Tax Avoidance and Evasion,\u201d Page 4 (Page 8 of PDF).\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRegulations on Abusive Tax Shelters and Transactions.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cWhat Are Municipal Bonds?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cEarned Income and Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) Tables.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRev.
