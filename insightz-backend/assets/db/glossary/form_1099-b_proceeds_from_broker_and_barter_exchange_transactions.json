  "definition": "Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax form used by brokerages and barter exchanges to record customers' gains and losses during a tax year.\n\nIndividual taxpayers receive the form from their brokers or barter exchange already filled out. Taxpayers transfer the information from a 1099-B toForm 8949to calculate their preliminary gains and losses. The result is entered ontoSchedule Dof their tax return.\n\nBrokers must submit a 1099-B form to the IRS and send a copy directly to every customer who sold stocks,options,commodities, or other securities during the tax year. The IRS requires submission of the form to serve as a record of a taxpayer\u2019s gains or losses.Forms are required to be sent to investors by February 15.\n\nFor example, let's assume you sold several stocks last year. The proceeds of the sales were $10,000. That figure will be reported to the IRS by the brokerage via a 1099-B form and by you as a report of a taxablecapital gain.\n\nThe form may also be filed by companies that participate in certain bartering activities with others.\u00a0For this, the form is used to report changes incapital structureor control of a corporation in which you hold stock.\n\nThe broker or barter exchange must mail a copy of a 1099-B form to all clients by Feb. 15 of the year following the tax year. If you don't receive yours, contact the issuer for a replacement copy.\n\nA separate Form 1099-B must be filed by a brokerage or barter exchange for every single transaction involving the sale (includingshort sales) of stocks, commodities, regulated futures contracts, foreign currency contracts (pursuant to a forward contract or regulated futures contract), forward contracts, debt instruments, options, or securities futures contracts.\n\nInformation on Form 1099-B includes:\n\nCommissions\u00a0for these transactions do not apply and are, therefore, excluded from the form.\n\nAs a taxpayer, yourcapital lossesare subtracted from any capital gains and may be used to reduce the taxable income you report.\u00a0There are limits to the amount ofcapital loss that can be deductedeach tax year. However, if the capital loss exceeds the limit, the difference may becarried overto the following tax year(s).\n\nThe form reports the cash received and thefair market value (FMV)of goods or services received or anytrade creditsreceived. Taxpayers may be required to report the receipt of gains made during the bartering activity. Reportable gains can be in the form of cash, property, or stock.\n\nA broker or barter exchange should report each transaction (other than regulatedfutures, foreign currency, orSection 1256option contracts) on a separate Form 1099-B.\n\nIf you receive a 1099-B, you will need to file Schedule D. This is where you record your gains and losses for the year. Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets is used to record the details of the transactions.\n\nForm 1099-B is used to report capital gains and losses that a taxpayer incurs after selling certain assets through brokerages and barter exchanges.These firms send separate forms for each transaction to both the IRS and the investor.\n\nYou must report the information found on Form 1099-B on Schedule D and/or Form 8949 as capital gains or losses.\n\nIssuers include their information and yours on Form 1099-B. It also includes a description of the property sold, the acquisition date, the sale date and price, the original price, and any deductions that apply. Other information includes any federal tax withheld, gains or losses incurred, and state tax withholdings.\n\nWhile you don't send the actual Form 1099-B to the IRS with your tax return, you must include the information that's on it on Form 8949 and send that along with Schedule D, which is what you'll use to record your totals for all transactions shown on Form 8949.\n\nNo. 1099-B reports capital gains and losses. A capital gain or loss results from selling an asset you own, such as a stock, stock option, or bond. Earned income is income you receive from your employment.\n\nForm 1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions is the form issued to taxpayers that reports their capital gains and losses for the tax year. It is sent by the broker or barter exchange to clients and the IRS.\n\nTaxpayers don't include Form 1099-B with their tax return but they do transfer the information on it to Form 8949 to calculate their capital gains and losses. These totals are then recorded on Schedule D. Both forms should be included in the tax return sent to the IRS.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Form 1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"General Instructions for Certain Information Returns: (Forms 1096, 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G),\" Page 26.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,\" Pages 4-5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 409, Capital Gains and Losses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,\" Page 5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,\" Page 7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,\" Pages 7-8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Schedule D (Form 1040), Capital Gains and Losses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Form 8949, Sales and Other Dispositions of Capital Assets.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1099-B, Proceeds from Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions,\" Pages 4-5, 7.",
