  "definition": "Longitudinal data, sometimes called panel data, is data that is collected through a series of repeated observations of the same subjects over some extended time frame\u2014and is useful for measuring change.\n\nLongitudinal data is collected through longitudinal studies and effectively follows the same sample over time, which differs fundamentally fromcross-sectional databecause it follows the same subjects over some time, while cross-sectional data samples different subjects (whether individuals, firms, countries, or regions) at each point in time. Meanwhile, a cross-sectional data set will always draw a newrandom sample.\n\nLongitudinal data is used widely in the social sciences, including among economists, political scientists, and sociologists.\n\nOften, analysts are interested in how things change over time. In a typical cross-sectional sample, even if you measure some variable today and then again a year from now, you will probably be sampling different people each time. To get a better handle on how things change for the same people over time, you need to be able to track them and follow up with them a year from now, and in future waves. This is longitudinal data.\n\nLongitudinal data is often used in economic and financial studies because it has several advantages over repeated cross-sectional data. For example, because longitudinal data measures how long events last, it can be used to see if the same group of individuals remain unemployed during arecession, or whether different individuals are moving in and out ofunemployment.This can help determine the factors that most affect unemployment.\n\nA\u00a0longitudinal study involves repeated observations of the same variables (such as people) over long time periods (i.e., using\u00a0longitudinal data). It is often an observational study, but can also be structured as a longitudinal\u00a0randomized experiment. It is also known as a longitudinal survey or\u00a0panel study.\n\nIn a longitudinal study,\u00a0researchers repeatedly examine the same individuals to detect any changes that might occur over a period of time.\u00a0The benefit of a longitudinal study is that researchers are able to\u00a0detect developments or changes in the characteristics of the target population at both the group and the individual level.\n\nAn example of a longitudinal study would be a study conducted to understand the similarities or differences between identical twins who are brought up together vs. identical twins who are not. The study observes several variables, but the constant is that all the participants have identical twins.\n\nLongitudinal analysis can also be used to calculate a portfolio\u2019svalue at risk (VaR), using the historic simulation method. This simulates how the value of the currentportfoliowould have fluctuated over previous time periods, using the observed historical fluctuations of the assets in the portfolio during those times. It provides an estimate of the maximum likely loss over the next time period.\n\nLongitudinal data is also used inevent studiesto analyze what factors drive abnormal stock returns over time, or how stock prices react to merger and earnings announcements. It can also be used to measure poverty and income inequality by tracking individual households. And because standardized test scores in schools are longitudinal, they can be used to assess teacher effectiveness and other factors affecting student performance.\n\nSocial scientists also use longitudinal data to try to understand causation of events that may have occurred in the past and how they lead to outcomes observed in later waves of the data\u2014for instance, the effect of the passage of a new law on crime statistics, or a natural disaster on births and deaths years later.\n\nLongitudinal data are sometimes called panel data, but there is a subtle difference between the two. Longitudinal data refer to repetitive measurements over time that could be the same units or otherwise.\u00a0Panel data are a type of longitudinal data where the observed units are the same.\n\nLongitudinal studies are\u00a0primarily qualitative research because the researcher observes and records changes in variables over an extended period. However, they can also be used to gather quantitative data depending on your research context.\n\nA drawback to any longitudinal study is the great amount of time necessary to collect all the data that is needed before you can start making patterns.\n\nLongitudinal data is data that is collected sequentially through repeated observations of the same subjects over time. It is useful for measuring change and is used in finance to track company profitability, risk, and to understand the effect of economic shocks.\n\nNational Longitudinal Surveys, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cWhat Are Longitudinal Data?\u201d",
