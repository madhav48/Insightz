  "term": "Disinvestment: Definition, Meaning, Types, and Examples",
  "definition": "Disinvestment is the action of an organization or government selling or liquidating an asset or subsidiary. Absent the sale of an asset, disinvestment also refers tocapital expenditure (CapEx)reductions, which can facilitate the reallocation of resources to more productive areas within an organization or government-funded project.\n\nWhether disinvestment results in thedivestitureor the reduction of funding, the primary objective is to maximize thereturn on investment (ROI)related tocapital goods, labor, and infrastructure.\n\nDisinvestments, in most cases, are primarily motivated by\u00a0the optimization of resources to deliver maximum returns. To achieve this objective, disinvestment may take the form of selling, spinning off, or reducing capital expenditures (CapEx). Disinvestments may also be undertaken for political or legal reasons.\n\nWithin the target market forcommoditized goods, a company may identify product segments delivering higher profitability than others, while expenditures, resources, and infrastructure required for manufacturing remain the same for both products.\n\nFor example, a company may determine that its industrial tool division is growing faster and generating higherprofit marginsthan its consumer tool division. If the difference in the profitability of the two divisions is large enough, then the company may consider disinvesting (e.g., selling) the consumer division. After the disinvestment, the company could allocate both the sales proceeds and recurring capital expenditures to the industrial division to maximize its ROI.\n\nA company may opt for the disinvestment of certain assets of a company it has acquired, particularly if those assets do not fit with its overall strategy. For example, a company focused on domestic operations may sell the international division of a company it has purchased, due to the complexities and costs of integration, as well as operating it on an ongoing basis.\n\nAs a result of the disinvestment, the acquiring company can reduce the total cost of the purchase and determine the optimal use of the proceeds, which may include reducing debt, keeping the cash on thebalance sheet, or making capital investments.\n\nOrganizations may decide on the disinvestment of holdings that no longer fit with their social, environmental, or philosophical positions. For example, the Rockefeller Family Foundation, which derived its wealth from oil, divested its energy holdings in 2016 due to false statements from oil companies regarding global warming.\n\nCompanies considered to bemonopoliesmay be legally required to disinvest holdings to ensure fair competition. For example, after being found to be a monopoly after eight years in court,AT&T(T) divested its seven regional operating companies in 1984. After disinvestment, AT&T retained its long-distance services, while the operating companies, referred to as theBaby Bells, provided regional services.\n\nDisinvestment in fossil fuels is the most prominent and recent example of political and environment-related disinvestment. In 2011, students on college campuses began demanding that theirendowmentfoundations\u2014which are some of the richest institutional investors in the world\u2014begin divesting their stakes in fossil fuel companies because they were major carbon polluters.\n\nThe movement spans 37 countries and has resulted in the divestiture of $6.2 trillion worth of assets, according to a report from Arabella Advisors. One thousand institutional investors, including insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and pension funds, have committed to divest assets related to fossil fuels. The report attributes the surge in fossil fuel-related divestments to moral pressure that gave way to financial and fiduciary imperatives as the movement grew and stocks for major oil companies fell.\n\nMeanwhile, Weyerhaeuser Co. (WY) is an example of strategic disinvestment. The Washington-based company was a manufacturer of paper and paper products until 2004. Since that year, it has divested operations by selling its pulp-and-paper manufacturing businesses to focus on real estate and timber.\n\nDisinvestments are most often motivated by\u00a0optimizing resources to deliver maximum returns. Disinvestments may also occur for environmental, legal, political, or strategic reasons.\n\nDisinvestment may occur by selling, spinning off, or reducing capital expenditures (CapEx).\n\nWhen an organization or government sells or liquidates an asset or subsidiary, that\u2019s disinvestment. The term can also refer to capital expenditure (CapEx) reductions, which can facilitate the reallocation of resources to more productive areas within an organization or government-funded project. The primary objective of disinvestment is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) related to capital goods, labor, and infrastructure.\n\nArabella Investors. \u201cThe Global Fossil Fuel Divestment and Clean Energy Investment Movement,\u201d Pages 1\u20132.",
