  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\n\"Dual income, no kids\" (DINK) is a slang phrase for a household in which there are two people earningincomesbut no dependent children. Couples in DINK household often have moredisposable incomebecause they do not have the added expenses that comes with raising children.\n\nThis extra money allows for more flexibility in savings, investments, and discretionary spending, such as vacations and luxury goods/ They also often spend less per person on housing than singles because of their ability to share kitchens, bathrooms, and living rooms.\n\nFor comparison, consider the opposite scenario\u2014dual income with kids (DEWK), where both partners work while raising children. The financial dynamics differ significantly between the two living arrangements.\n\nWhen two people in a household are earning income and they have no children who depend on them to support them, they can put more money toward financial goals likesavings. They will also have more disposable income that will give them the ability to spend more on non-necessary expenses.\n\nCosts associated with raising one or more children include food, clothing, and long-term education, and more. The average middle income family will pay $310,605 to raise a child born in 2015 to age 17, according to a Brookings Institution study. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that will be $233,610, however this estimate does not account for inflation. Of course, the exact cost to raise a child will vary significantly from family to family.\n\nWhile DINKs may not necessarily be wealthy, they often have a more discretionary income than families with children, allowing them to save more, invest, and enjoy a higher quality of life. As a result, DINKs are often targets ofmarketingefforts for investment products andluxury items, such as expensive cars and vacations. They also tend to spend less on housing than singles, as the shared living spaces lower overall costs.\n\nSharing financial resources gives DINKs more disposable income than singles as well as couples that are married with children.\n\nDINKs can often invest more than their counterparts with children or who are single. The money that might have been spent on children could be put intostocks,bonds, or other investment vehicles. Investing even a few thousand dollars per year can potentially increase earnings even more.\n\nThere are several situations that can be considered \"dual-income, no kids.\" They include couples who choose not to have kids, those who cannot have kids, new couples, empty nesters, roommates, and adult child and parent living arrangements.\n\nSome couples make a conscious decision to remain child-free, whether for lifestyle preferences, financial reasons, or health-related concerns. These couples enjoy the financial benefits of having two incomes without the significant expenses associated with raising children.\n\nLGBTQA+ couplesor couples who desire children but face medical challenges that prevent them from having them (such as infertility or other health issues) may also find themselves in a DINK situation. However, they face additional costs associated withfertility treatmentsor adoption if they choose those paths, as thecost of adoptioncan run up to $50,000 or more.And the average cost of one In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) cycle as of 2023 is $21,600, according to Carrot Fertility.\n\nCouples just starting their life together, whether they arenewlywedsor partners who\u2019ve recently moved in together, can also be part of the DINK demographic. While they may eventually have children, during the early stages of their relationship, they have the financial freedom of a dual-income household without the added expense of children.\n\nAt this stage in their lives they may be saving for major purchase milestones likebuying a homeor buying a car. They may be saving for a wedding or carrying debt from paying for one. They also may be saving money to prepare for the cost of raising children.\n\nAfter the children have grown up and moved out, couples may become part of the dual income, no kids demographic again. They may find they have extra money in their budget that they once spent on kids. They might also gain funds by selling their house anddownsizing.\n\nEmpty nesters often change their financial focus from supporting their children tosaving more for retirement. If they already have substantial savings, it could be time to start taking more vacations before the couple gets too old to enjoy them. Unlike new couples, empty nesters are likely not concerned with saving to buy their first house or car.\n\nIf two adult household members are earning income and they have no children, they would be considered a \"dual income, no kids\" situation. A household is generally considered a situation in which members share living quarters, whether they are related or not, according to the U.S Census Bureau definition.\n\nSo, roommates living together or an adult child living with a parent would likely be considered a household. However, residents living together in an apartment building would not be considered a household because they are living in separate quarters.\n\nA DINK (dual income, no kids) lifestyle is generally perceived as having more time and financial means to fund non-necessary expenses such as on eating out at restaurants or entertainment. Households with more income and without the expenses associated with having children tend to have more disposable income. Dual income, no kids households can oftensave more for retirementthan their counterparts who have children.\n\nThecost to raise a childis increasing along with inflation. Estimates vary on the exact cost, but it will likely cost roughly between $200,000 and $300,000. According to a Brookings Institution study, the average middle income family will pay $310,605 to raise a child born in 2015 to age 17. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that cost to be $233,610.\n\nA dual income household is one in which two adults are earning money and sharing their financial resources. They also share responsibilities for expenses. This financial situation often results in moredisposable incomethey can use for spending or saving more.\n\n\"Dual income, no kids\" (DINK) households are a diverse group that includes couples who choose not to have children, those who are unable to have children, and other variations like roommates or adult child-parent households. The absence of children\u2019s financial burdens provides DINKs with more disposable income to save, invest, or enjoy leisure activities. As a result, they are often a primary target for marketers offering luxury goods and services.\n\nBrown Brothers Harriman. \"Dual Income, No Kids: Learing About DINKs and the DINK Lifestyle.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Nutrition Service. \u201c2015 Expenditures on Children by Families: Parents Projected to Spend $233,610 to Raise a Child Born in 2015.\"\n\nBrookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019s Getting More Expensive to Raise Children.
