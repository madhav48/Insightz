  "term": "Revealed Preference In Economics: What Does It Show?",
  "definition": "Revealed preference is an economic theory that suggests that consumers\u2019 buying habits dictate their preferences.\n\nRevealed preference, a theory offered by American economistPaul Anthony Samuelsonin 1938, states that consumer behavior, if their income and the item\u2019s price are held constant, is the best indicator of their preferences.\n\nFor a long time, consumer behavior, most notably consumer choice, had been understood through the concept of utility. In economics,utilityrefers to how much satisfaction\u00a0or pleasure consumers get from the purchase of a product, service, or experienced event. However, utility is incredibly difficult to quantify in indisputable terms, and by the beginning of the 20th century, economists were complaining about the pervasive reliance on utility. Replacement theories were considered, but all were similarly criticized, until Samuelson\u2019s \u201cRevealed Preference Theory,\u201d which posited thatconsumer behaviorwas not based on utility, but on observable behavior that relied on a small number of relatively uncontested assumptions.\n\nRevealed preference is an economic theory regarding an individual\u2019s consumption patterns, which asserts that the best way to measure consumer preferences is to observe their purchasing behavior. Revealed preference theory works on the assumption that consumers are rational. In other words, they will have considered a set of alternatives before making a purchasing decision that is best for them. Thus, given that a consumer chooses one option out of the set, this option must be the preferred option.\n\nRevealed preference theory allows room for the preferred option to\u00a0change depending upon price and budgetary constraints. By examining the preference at each point of constraint, a schedule can be created of a given population\u2019s preferred items under a varied schedule of pricing and budget constraints. The theory states that given a consumer\u2019s budget, they will select the same bundle of goods (the \u201cpreferred\u201d bundle) as long as that bundle remains affordable. It is only if the preferential bundle becomes unaffordable that they will switch to a less expensive, less desirable bundle of goods.\n\nThe original intention of revealed preference theory was to expand upon the theory of diminishingmarginal utility, coined by Jeremy Bentham.Utility, or enjoyment from a good, is very hard to quantify, so Samuelson set about looking for a way to do so.\u00a0Since then, revealed preference theory has been expanded upon by a number ofeconomistsand remains a major theory of consumption behavior. The theory is especially useful in providing a method for analyzing consumer choice empirically.\n\nAs economists developed the revealed preference theory, they identified three primary axioms of revealed preference\u2014the weak axiom, the strong axiom, and the generalized axiom.\n\nAs an example of the relationships expounded upon in revealed preference theory, consider consumer X who purchases a pound of grapes. It is assumed under revealed preference theory that consumer X prefers that pound of grapes above all other items that cost the same, or are cheaper than, that pound of grapes. Since consumer X prefers that pound of grapes over all other items they can afford, they will only purchase something other than that pound of grapes if the pound of grapes becomes unaffordable. If the pound of grapes becomes unaffordable, consumer X will then move on to a less preferable substitute item.\n\nSome economists say that revealed preference theory makes too many assumptions. For instance, how can we be sure that consumer\u2019s preferences remain constant over time? Isn\u2019t it possible that an action at a specific point in time reveals part of a consumer\u2019s preference scale just at that time? For example, if just an orange and an apple were available for purchase, and the consumer chooses an apple, then we can definitely say that the apple is revealed as preferred to the orange.\n\nThere is no proof to back up the assumption that a preference remains unchanged from one point in time to another. In the real world, there are lots of alternative choices. It is impossible to determine what product or set of products or behavioral options were turned down in preference to buying an apple.\n\nBrown University, Orlando Bravo Center for Economic Research. \u201cA Rationalization of the Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference.\u201d\n\nPrinceton University Press. \u201cRevealed Preference.\u201d Page 8.",
