  "definition": "Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nThe term funds from operations (FFO) refers\u00a0to the figure used byreal estate investment trusts (REITs)to define the cash flow from their operations. Real estate companies use FFO as a measurement of operating performance. FFO is calculated by adding depreciation, amortization, and losses on sales of assets to earnings and then\u00a0subtracting any gains on sales of assets and any interest income. It is sometimes quoted on a per-share basis. The FFO-per-share ratio should be used in lieu ofearnings per share (EPS)when evaluating REITs and other similar investment trusts.\n\nFFO=(NI+D+A+PSL)\u2212PSG\u2212IIwhere:FFO=Funds\u00a0from\u00a0operationsNI=Net\u00a0incomeD=DepreciationA=AmortizationPSL=Property\u00a0Sales\u00a0LossesPSG=Property\u00a0Sales\u00a0GainsII=Interest\u00a0Income\\begin{aligned}&\\text{FFO} = (\\text{NI} + \\text{D} + \\text{A} + \\text{PSL} ) - \\text{PSG} - \\text{II} \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&\\text{FFO} = \\text{Funds from operations} \\\\&\\text{NI} = \\text{Net income} \\\\&\\text{D} = \\text{Depreciation} \\\\&\\text{A} = \\text{Amortization} \\\\&\\text{PSL} = \\text{Property Sales Losses} \\\\&\\text{PSG} = \\text{Property Sales Gains} \\\\&\\text{II} = \\text{Interest Income} \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bFFO=(NI+D+A+PSL)\u2212PSG\u2212IIwhere:FFO=Funds\u00a0from\u00a0operationsNI=Net\u00a0incomeD=DepreciationA=AmortizationPSL=Property\u00a0Sales\u00a0LossesPSG=Property\u00a0Sales\u00a0GainsII=Interest\u00a0Income\u200b\n\nAll components of the FFO calculation are listed on a REIT'sincome statement. Here are the steps to take to calculate it:\n\nIf, for example, a REIT had depreciation of $20,000, gains on sales of property of $40,000,\u00a0and net profit of $100,000, its FFO would be $80,000.\n\nIn most situations, you won't need to calculate a REIT's FFO because all REITs are required to show their FFO calculations on their publicfinancial statements. The FFO figure is typically disclosed in thefootnotesfor the income statement.\n\nFFO is a measure of the cash generated by a REIT. Real estate companies use FFO as an operating performance benchmark. TheNational Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT)originally pioneered this figure, which is anon-GAAPmeasure.\n\nThe funds from operations measure the net amount of cash and equivalents that flows into a firm from regular, ongoing business activities. FFO should not be seen as an alternative to cash flow or as a measure ofliquidity.\n\nFor example, a typical company's cash flow would be influenced by the money earned from the sale of an asset, but FFO excludes those gains. Also, a typical company would show a cash inflow on its CFS if the company received loan proceeds from a bank. However, FFO does not include such cash inflows. Instead, it is only a measure of the income frombusiness activities.\n\nDon't confuse a REIT's funds from operations with other metrics, such as thecash flow from operations. This figure is reported on thestatement of cash flows (CFS)and represents money that a company earns from its normal core operations. A company'searnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)is also different. This metric measures the corporation's profitability to net income by factoring out depreciation and amortization expenses, along with taxes and liability costs.\n\nFFO compensates for cost-accounting methods that may inaccurately communicate a REIT's true performance.Generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)require that all REITs depreciate theirinvestment propertiesover time\u00a0using one of the standard depreciation methods. However, many investment properties actually increase in value over time, making depreciation inaccurate in describing the value of a REIT. Depreciation and amortization must be added back to net income to reconcile this issue.\n\nFFO also subtracts any gains on sales of property\u00a0because these types of sales are considered to be nonrecurring. REITs must pay out 90% of alltaxable incomein the form ofdividends, which are cash payments to investors. Gains on sales of property do not add to a REIT's taxable income and should therefore not be included in the measurement of value and performance.\n\nAs mentioned, FFO per share is sometimes provided by firms as a supplement to their EPS. Earnings per share is a company's net income divided by the outstandingequityshares. EPS and FFO per share provide a measure of how much income is being generated on a per-share basis.\n\nThese measures also help investors determine whether the money is being used effectively by management. Also, many analysts and investors assess a REIT's price-FFO ratio as a supplement to theprice-to-earnings (P/E)\u00a0ratio, which is the stock price divided by EPS. In the case of a REIT, the market price of the REIT would be divided by its FFO per share.\n\nReal estateanalystsare also increasingly calculating\u00a0a REIT'sadjusted funds from operations (AFFO). This calculation takes a REIT's FFO and subtracts any recurring expenditure that iscapitalizedand then amortized, as well as anystraight-liningof rents. These recurring capital expenditures may include such maintenance expenses as painting projects or roof replacements. AFFO has gained traction as a more accurate estimate of a REIT's earnings potential.\n\nThe AFFO measure was developed\u00a0to provide a better measure of a REIT's\u00a0cash-generated or dividend-paying capacity. In addition to AFFO, this alternate measure is sometimes referred to as funds available for distribution or cash available for distribution.\n\nSimon Property Group is a popular mall REIT. It reported funds from operations on its 2017 income statement of\u00a0$4 billion, up 6% from 2016.\u00a0The firm's net income, meanwhile, totaled $2.2 billion.\n\nTo arrive at FFO, the firm added back depreciation and amortization of about $1.8 billion, and further adjusted for other smaller figures\u2014including a\u00a0reduction\u00a0of $5.3\u00a0million for payment of preferred distributions\u00a0and dividends,\u00a0and anoncontrolling interestsportion of depreciation and amortization that resulted in an additional $17.1\u00a0million\u00a0reduction.\n\nSimon also reported a diluted FFO-per-share figure of $11.21, compared to adiluted EPSfigure of $6.24.\n\nFunds from operations measure how much cash a real estate investment trust generates. This cash is derived from a variety of sources, including regular business activities. FFO is the way that REITs measure their operating performance. Keep in mind that FFO doesn't include the gains a REIT makes on the sale of its property(s). That's because this doesn't count as an ongoing or recurring activity.\n\nREITs are required to disclose their funds from operations to the general public. You can easily find this figure on a REITs public financial statements. Search for the income statement and look for this figure within the footnotes. You can also calculate the FFO by adding together the REIT's net income, depreciation, amortization, and losses on property sales. Then subtract that figure from any gains on property sales and any interest income.\n\nIt may be easy to confuse a REIT's funds from operations and the cash flow from operations. But the two are different from one another. The FFO represents the operating performance and takes net income, depreciation, amortization, and losses on property sales into account while factoring out any interest income and gains from property sales.\n\nThe cash flow from operations, on the other hand, is reported on the cash flow statement. It's the total amount of cash that a company earns during the course of its operations. This includes working capital, revenue, and expenses.\n\nThere are a number of ways you can measure a company's success. The metric depends on the type of corporation. For instance, some companies measure their profitability using EBITDA or return on equity. REITs, though, use funds from operations. This figure, which measures the company's operating performance, was established by NAREIT and is now an industry standard. It takes into account depreciation, amortization, and losses on the sale of property while factoring out any interest earned along with the gains on property sales. But don't worry, You won't have to calculate this figure. You can find it in the footnotes of the REITs income statement.",
