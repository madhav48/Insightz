  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) is a standard that sets out guidelines fortrusteesto follow when investing trust assets on behalf of atrustor. It also applies to financial professionals who make recommendations or place trades on behalf of clients. It is an update to the former \"Prudent Man\" standard intended to reflect the changes that have occurred in investment practice since the late 1960s.\n\nSpecifically, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act adopts amodern portfolio theory(MPT) andtotal returnapproach to the exercise offiduciaryinvestment and discretion.\n\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act was adopted in 1992 by the American Law Institute\u2019s Third Restatement of the Law of Trusts. It was an update to the previously accepted Prudent Man Rule.\n\nBy taking the total portfolio approach and eliminating category restrictions on different types of investments, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act fostered a greater degree of diversification in investment portfolios. It also made it possible for trustees to include in their portfolios investments such as derivatives, commodities, and futures. While these investments individually have a relatively higher degree of risk, they could theoretically reduce overall portfolio risk and boost returns when considered in a total portfolio context.\n\nThe Prudent Man Rule was based on Massachusetts common law written in 1830 and revised in 1959. It stated that a trust fiduciary was required to invest trust assets as a \u201cprudent man\u201d would invest his own assets, with the following in mind:\n\nAprudent investmentwill not always turn out to be a highly profitable investment; in addition, no one can predict with certainty what will happen with any investment decision.\n\nMore recently, the prudent man rule has been renamed theprudent person rule. This set of guidelines can also be applied outside of trustee domains, where it is referred to as theprudent investor rule.\n\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act made four main changes to the previous Prudent Man Rule standard:\n\nThe Uniform Prudent Investor Act\u2019s most important change was that the standard of prudence would henceforth be applied to any investment in the context of the total portfolio, rather than to individual investments.\n\nNational Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws. \"Uniform Trust Code,\" Page 2.
