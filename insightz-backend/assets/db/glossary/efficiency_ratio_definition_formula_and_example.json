  "term": "Efficiency Ratio: Definition, Formula, and Example",
  "definition": "The efficiency ratio is typically used to analyze how well a company uses its assets and liabilities internally.\n\nAnefficiencyratio can calculate the turnover of receivables, the repayment of liabilities, the quantity and usage of equity, and the general use of inventory and machinery. This ratio can also be used to track and analyze the performance of commercial and investment banks.\n\nEfficiency ratios,\u00a0also\u00a0known as activity ratios,\u00a0are used by analysts to\u00a0measure the performance of a company\u2019s short-term or current performance. All of these ratios use numbers in a company\u2019scurrent assetsorcurrent liabilities, quantifying the operations of the business.\n\nAn efficiency ratio measures a company\u2019s ability to use itsassetsto generateincome. For example, an efficiency ratio often looks at various aspects of the company, such as the time it takes to collect cash from customers or to convertinventoryto cash. This makes efficiency ratios important, because an improvement in the efficiency ratios usually translates to improved profitability.\n\nThese ratioscan be compared with peers in the same industryand can identify businesses that are better managed relative to the others. Some common efficiency ratios areaccounts receivable turnover,fixed asset turnover, sales to inventory, sales to net working capital, accounts payable to sales, and stock turnover ratio.\n\nIn thebankingindustry, an efficiency ratio has a specific meaning. For banks, the efficiency ratio is non-interest expenses/revenue. This shows how well the bank\u2019s managers control their overhead (or \u201cback office\u201d) expenses.\n\nLike the efficiency ratios above, this allows analysts to assess the performance of commercial and investment banks.\n\nEfficiency\u00a0Ratio=Expenses\u2020Revenue\u2020not\u00a0including\u00a0interest\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Efficiency Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Expenses}^{\\dagger}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\\\ &\\dagger \\text{not including interest}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEfficiency\u00a0Ratio=RevenueExpenses\u2020\u200b\u2020not\u00a0including\u00a0interest\u200b\n\nSince a bank\u2019soperating expensesare in the numerator and itsrevenueis in the denominator, a lower efficiency ratio means that a bank is operating better.\n\nAn efficiency ratio of 50% or under is considered optimal. If the efficiency ratio increases, it means a bank\u2019s expenses are increasing or its revenues are decreasing.\n\nFor example, Bank X reported\u00a0quarterly earnings and had an\u00a0efficiency ratio of 57.1%, which was lower than the 63.2% ratio it reported for the same quarter last year. This means the company\u2019s operations became more efficient, increasing\u00a0its assets by $80 million for thequarter.\n\nAn efficiency ratio measures a company\u2019s ability to use its assets to generate income.
