  "definition": "A licensee is any individual, business, organization that has been granted legal permission, or certain rights by another entity who owns certain assets, to engage in any activity related to these assets. This permission, or\u00a0license, can be given on an express or implied basis.\n\nA licensee has received legal permission\u00a0from another party to conduct some sort of business over which the other party holds some control, ownership, or authority.\n\nThe licensee may pay outright for this permission, by what is known as alicensing fee. Or they may make payments related to the results of the activities that the business arrangement facilitates. This is known aslicensing revenue.\n\nSome licensees may compensate license owners with ongoing fees, royalties, or another revenue-sharing arrangement.\n\nVarious licensing relationships exist in the business world.\n\nNormally, a licensing arrangement between a licensee and the licensor is a mutually beneficial financial relationship. It can sometimes generate a great deal of revenue for both parties.\n\nHere are examples of some of the licensee/license types that exist in business.\n\nUnder afranchiseagreement, the franchisee (or licensee) is granted permission to use thefranchisor\u2019sassets, such as a supply chain, trademarks, or other intellectual property for a certain period of time. Typically, the franchisee is granted exclusive rights to those assets within a certain localized area.\n\nExamples of franchisees include the owner-operators of many retail stores or restaurants, including some fast food locations.\n\nWIth brand licensing, the\u00a0licensee is permitted to use a brand's trademarks and logos on its own manufactured products, such as sports apparel and toys.\n\nFor instance, a hit superhero movie may be released and generate a large fan base. The characters in the film are the property of the movie studio, but the studio decides to solicit licensing agreements from various producers of consumer goods that would allow those producers to use the characters on their products.\n\nAs a result, the likenesses of these characters may appear on clothing, posters, lunch boxes, and in games. They may also appear as action figures or dolls.\n\nThe producers of all these items are unaffiliated with the movie studio. Per their licensing agreements, they must pay fees or royalties to the studio to represent the movie'sbrand.\n\nA licensee may be an entity that has been granted legal or regulatory permission to operate a business. Such a license is a mechanism for governments to oversee, and in many cases tax, certain business operators.\n\nA liquor license is an example. By issuing the license, a city or county ensures compliance with local regulations regarding alcoholic beverages. It also receives an additional revenue stream specifically associated with the sale of alcohol.\n\nMany types of businesses are required to obtain an operating license before being able to do business legally.These licensees can range from food trucks to banks. Operating licenses can be granted at various levels of governance, from local or state governments (e.g., for food trucks) all the way up to federal regulators (e.g., for banks).\n\nA license to sell securities is a similar permission granted on a state or nationwide basis. National licenses are granted byFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), a private regulatory authority that enforces the rules governing registered brokers andbroker-dealerfirms in the United States. Examples of this type of license include theSeries 7andSeries 63licenses.\n\nA licensee can have permission to access real estate. Typically, a licensee of a property has been granted express permission to make use of land by the landowner. The property in question is not open to the general public.\n\nA common example used in law schools is that of a hunter who has written permission to hunt on a landowner\u2019s property. Without this permission, the hunter would be considered a trespasser and have very little legal protection from hazards encountered while hunting there.\n\nNor could the hunter be considered an invitee, a legal term to describe a guest with recourse to take legal action in response to damages suffered while in the property.\n\nAn implied license can be a more ambiguous relationship, as no express permission has been granted legally. The classic example of the implied license is the implied permission a firefighter has to enter a burning building, even if the owner is not present to formally approve the entry. In business, this concept tends to involve a licensee interpreting communications with a licensor as implied permission to make use of an asset.\n\nIn addition to paying fees or sharing revenues for being granted a license, licensees are often subject to requirements that they treat the granted permission responsibly.\n\nThe aforementioned hunter is expected to leave the property in the condition that they found it. The securities broker is required to recommend investments appropriate to the client. The liquor store operator is prohibited from selling to underage customers.\n\nA license does not grant free rein to the licensee to exploit the licensed rights, whether those rights relate to a public or private asset.\n\nA licensee is one who has been given limited permission to use or occupy a property (physical or intellectual property). The licensee will compensate the owner of the property for its use, the terms of which will be spelled out in a licensing agreement. As such, the tenant of a rented apartment may be considered a licensee of sorts.\n\nThe licensor is the owner of some property (or the rights thereof) that grants permission to a licensee to use that property, in return for compensation from the licensee.\n\nThis term implies that a business has applied for and holds a valid license, obtained from the proper authority, to legally operate or do business in a certain location or locations.\n\nA licensing agency is a broker that brings together license owners with potential licensees and arranges licensing agreements between them. A licensing agent may approach the owner of a license to see if they would be interested in such an arrangement.\n\nA licensee is any individual or entity that has received legal permission (or license) to conduct business activities that involve the use of assets belonging to another person or entity. For that permission, the licensee compensates the grantor of the license by payment of an upfront or periodic fee, or with a cut of the revenue they earn. Licenses can be explicit or implied.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Licensee.\"\n\nU.S. Small Business Association. \"Apply for Licenses and Permits.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Qualification Exams: Rules.\"",
