  "term": "Brand Identity: What It Is and How To Build One",
  "definition": "A brand identity is the visible elements of a company's brand, including consumer perception, colors, design, and its logo.\n\nBrand identity encompasses every way customers experience and perceive a business, from visual elements like logos to customer service interactions and marketing messages. While iconic examples like Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) minimalist aesthetic or NIKE, Inc.'s (NKE) \"Just Do It\" motto show how powerful brand identity can be, there's far more to it than coming up with the neatest logo.\n\nWhether a company is a startup or an established firm, understanding how it can build and maintain an effective brand identity in line with a broader business strategy could be the difference between thriving and merely surviving\u2014or even failing\u2014in today's competitive landscape.\n\nBrand identity is more than a company's visual calling card\u2014it's a strategic asset that can significantly affect its bottom line.\n\nConsider how brands affect your own buying decisions. Suppose you're choosing one hotel over another on Expedia.com. You'd be looking at many with similar prices, and your decision would likely hinge on your perception of a brand's reliability, service quality, and overall experience. These perceptions don't just arise from your previous experience of using a hotel chain. They're also built through consistent messaging and delivery across every touchpoint. Done well, this should translate into measurable results for a company.\n\nHere's what a well-crafted brand identity can do:\n\nThe word \"brand\" derives from an old Norse word,brandr, meaning \"to burn\"; this refers to marks that were burned into livestock to signify their owner.\n\nThe most successful companies treat brand identity as part of an integrated business strategy rather than something that succeeds or fails on its own. The financial impact of brand identity can be substantial. According toForbes' 2024 rankings, leading brands like Apple Inc. (AAPL; $241.2 billion) and NIKE, Inc. (NKE;$39.1 billion) carry enormous monetary value. Yet, they would be valued far less if Apple and Nike were considered unable to deliver on what their branding promised.\n\nForsmaller businesses, brand identity's impact might be more modest but remains crucial. A local restaurant's consistent service style, interior design, and social media presence can create loyal customers willing to pay premium prices, even in a crowded market. If you own a small business, the key is ensuring your brand identity authentically reflects your operational capabilities while differentiating you from competitors for your target customers.\n\nCreating a valuable brand identity requires systematic investment and careful execution across a company's media (social media, in-store advertising, etc.\u2014even printed receipts). The world's most valuable brands have consistent patterns in how they build and maintain their market positions:\n\nMarket analysis means studying both your potential customers and competitors to find gaps and opportunities. For example, when L'Or\u00e9al ($22.8B brand value) conducts market research, it analyzes the following:\n\nThis research informs everything from product development to marketing messages, helping justify its $10.3B advertising budget in 2024.\n\nThe visual system that makes your brand instantly recognizable:\n\nHow your brand sounds and speaks:\n\nHow customers interact with your brand:\n\nBuilding brand identity requires significant resources:\n\nDefine exactly where you sit in the market. Herm\u00e8s ($21.6B) positions itself as the ultimate luxury brand, justifying prices well above competitors.\n\n2.Matching Operational Capability\n\nEnsure you can deliver what you promise. Amazon Prime's two-day delivery promise required massive infrastructure investment before it could be marketed.\n\nStaff must embody the brand. Disney's theme park employees undergo extensive \"Disney University\" training to maintain consistent guest experiences.\n\nEvery interaction matters. Apple's brand value ($241.2B) comes partly from consistent experience across retail stores, website, packaging, and customer service.\n\nCompanies track their brand's health through the following:\n\nWhen brand elements don't match across channels. Example: A luxury brand using premium packaging but having a poorly designed website.\n\nMaking claims you can't deliver. Tesla, Inc.'s (TSLA) self-driving promises versus actual capability have affected trust.\n\nWhen employees don't understand or can't execute brand standards. Example: High-end retailers where staff don't provide luxury-level service.\n\n4.Failing To Adapt to Market Shifts\n\nNot evolving with customer needs. Kodak's decline came from holding onto film too long despite digital photography's rise.\n\nOveremphasizing logos and ads while neglecting customer experience. Many retailers invest in store appearance but underinvest in staff training.\n\nWhen United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL) emerged from the pandemic, it didn't just do a periodic update to its logo\u2014it transformed its customer experience, from social media responses to text message updates. United's post-pandemic transformation offers valuable lessons about both the power and limitations of brand identity.\n\nIn 2022, the airline launched its \"Good Leads The Way\" campaign alongside a complete overhaul of its customer experience. United put together a 35-person social media team, changed its customer communication strategy, and invested heavily in making its brand more responsive and customer-centric.\n\n\"Gone are the days where we just have two big advertising pushes a year,\" Maggie Schmerin, United's head of global advertising and social media,\u00a0said at the time. \"We\u2019re all about how we can be relevant and do a better job in social media and advertising.\"\n\nThe results seem to have worked: By 2024, premium revenue was up 10%, corporate revenue was up 7%, and revenue from its basic economy seats was up 20% year-over-year. Customer satisfaction scores improved significantly, and their app became the most downloaded in the industry.\n\nHowever, United wasn't alone among airlines in seeing major revenue increases in recent years. How much can be chalked up to a renewed focus on its brand identity instead of structural changes in the industry or improvements that customers can see?\n\nUnited CEO Scott Kirby suggested it was all three. \"United had a unique strategy coming out of COVID and our people have delivered for customers leading to a structurally and permanently changed industry,\" he said.\n\nThis nuanced view suggests that while strong brand identity alone rarely drives success, weak brand identity can certainly limit it.\n\nThe most successful companies treat brand building not as a separate marketing function, but as an integral part of their overall business strategy. A brand identity can be one of a company's most valuable complex assets.\n\nWhile top brands like Apple ($241.2B) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL; $207.5B) demonstrate the enormous financial potential of strong brand identity, their success comes from aligning brand promises with delivering services and products their customers want in markets that can change frequently.\n\nThe Open University. \"Defining What a Brand Is.\"\n\nL'Or\u00e9al. \"L'Or\u00e9al Group: Strategy & Model.\"\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"How Brand Building and Performance Marketing Can Work Together.\"\n\nThe Verge. \"The False Promises of Tesla's Full Self-Driving Capabilities.\"\n\nAd Age. \"2022 Best Marketers: United Airlines.\"\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings, Inc. \"United Airlines Achieves Record Fourth Quarter Profit Well Ahead Of Expectations.\"",
