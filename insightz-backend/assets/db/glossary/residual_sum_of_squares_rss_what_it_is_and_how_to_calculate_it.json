  "term": "Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): What It Is and How to Calculate It",
  "definition": "The residual sum of squares (RSS) is a statistical technique used to measure the amount ofvariancein a data set that is not explained by a regression model itself. Instead, it estimates the variance in the residuals, orerror term.\n\nLinear regression is a measurement that helps determine the strength of the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more other factors, known as independent or explanatory variables.\n\nIn general terms, thesum of squaresis a statistical technique used in regression analysis to determine the dispersion of data points. In a\u00a0regression analysis, the goal is to determine how well a data series can be fitted to a function that might help to explain how the data series was generated. The sum of squares is used as a mathematical way to find the function thatbest fits(varies least) from the data.\n\nThe RSS measures the amount of error remaining between the regression function and the data set after the model has been run. A smaller RSS figure represents a regression function that is well-fit to the data.\n\nThe RSS, also known as the sum of squared residuals, essentially determines how well a regression model explains or represents the data in the model.\n\nThe residual standard error (RSE) is another statistical term used to describe the difference instandard deviationsof observed values versus predicted values as shown by points in a\u00a0regression analysis. It is agoodness-of-fitmeasure that can be used to analyze how well a set of data points fit with the actual model.\n\nRSE is computed by dividing the RSS by the number of observations in the sample less 2, and then taking the square root: RSE = [RSS/(n-2)]1/2\n\nIn the realm of regression analysis, minimizing the residual sum of squares is crucial for achieving the best possible fit of a model to the data. Among the different techniques to make this happen, one of the most fundamental and widely used approaches isleast squares regression.\n\nLeast squares regression is a method that aims to find the line or curve that minimizes the sum of the squared differences. These differences will be between the observed values and the values predicted by the model. In essence, the least squares regression seeks to strike a balance where the model captures the underlying trend of the data while still minimizing the discrepancies between what's been observed and what's been predicted.\n\nThe process of minimizing RSS through least squares regression involves iteratively adjusting the parameters of the model. This is usually done until the optimal fit is achieved. For a simple linear regression model, this typically entails finding the slope and intercept of the line that best fits the data. In more complex scenarios, the process becomes more intricate but has many of the same principles.\n\nRSS has some limitations to it. First, RSS gives equal weight to all residuals. This means that outliers can disproportionately influence the RSS, meaning that estimated coefficients may be negatively skewed. Another downside is that RSS relies on several assumptions. If any assumption such as linearity, independence of errors, or homoscedasticity are violated, RSS may lead to biased estimates and incorrect inferences.\n\nWhile RSS is useful for evaluating the fit of a single model, comparing the fit across multiple models using RSS alone can be tough. This is because RSS depends on the number of parameters in the model. It isn't really meant to compare models with a different number of parameters.\n\nLast, while RSS is easy to compute and interpret, it provides limited insight into the underlying structure of the data. In cases where understanding the relationship between predictors and the response variable is important, there may be better metrics to use. In some ways, RSS can act somewhat like ablack boxwhere the relationships aren't entirely known; only the end value is of most importance.\n\nFinancial marketshave increasingly become more quantitatively driven; as such, in search of an edge, many investors are using advanced statistical techniques to aid in their decisions. Big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence applications further necessitate the use of statistical properties to guide contemporary investment strategies. The residual sum of squares\u2014or RSS statistics\u2014is one of many statistical properties enjoying a renaissance.\n\nStatistical models are used by investors and portfolio managers to track an investment's price and use that data to predict future movements. The study\u2014called regression analysis\u2014might involve analyzing the relationship in price movements between a commodity and the stocks of companies engaged in producing the commodity.\n\nFinding the residual sum of squares by hand can be difficult and time-consuming. Because it involves a\u00a0lot\u00a0of subtracting, squaring, and summing, the calculations can be prone to errors. For this reason, you may decide to use software, such as Excel, to do the calculations.\n\nAny model might have variances between the predicted values and actual results. Although the variances might be explained by the regression analysis, the RSS represents the variances or errors that are not explained.\n\nSince a sufficiently complex regression function can be made to closely fit virtually any data set, further study is necessary to determine whether the regression function is, in fact, useful in explaining the variance of the dataset.\n\nTypically, however, a smaller or lower value for the RSS is ideal in any model since it means there's less variation in the data set. In other words, the lower the sum of squared residuals, the better the regression model is at explaining the data.\n\nFor a simple (but lengthy) demonstration of the RSS calculation, consider the well-known correlation between a country's consumer spending and itsGDP. The following chart reflects the published values ofconsumer spendingand Gross Domestic Product for the 27 states of the European Union. Note that this information may have slightly changed since it has been published, but the example of residual sum of squares remains valid.\n\nConsumer spending and GDP have a strong positive correlation, and it is possible to predict a country's GDP based on consumer spending (CS). Using the formula for abest fit line, this relationship can be approximated as:\n\nThe units for both GDP and Consumer Spending are in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nThis formula is highly accurate for most purposes, but it is not perfect, due to the individual variations in each country's economy. The following chart compares the projected GDP of each country, based on the formula above, and the actual GDP as recorded by the World Bank.\n\nThe column on the right indicates the residual squares\u2013the squared difference between each projected value and its actual value. The numbers appear large, but their sum is actually lower than the RSS for any other possible trendline. If a different line had a lower RSS for these data points, that line would be the best fit line.\n\nThe\u00a0residual sum of squares (RSS)\u00a0is the absolute amount of explained variation, whereas R-squared is the absolute amount of variation as a proportion of total variation.\n\nThe residual sum of squares (RSS) is also known as the sum of squared estimate of errors (SSE).\n\nThe total sum of squares (TSS) measures how much variation there is in the observed data, while the residual sum of squares measures the variation in the error between the observed data and modeled values. In statistics, the values for the residual sum of squares and the total sum of squares (TSS) are oftentimes compared to each other.\n\nThe residual sum of squares can be zero. The smaller the residual sum of squares, the better your model fits your data; the greater the residual sum of squares, the poorer your model fits your data.\u00a0A value of zero means your model is a perfect fit.\n\nResidual sum of squares quantifies the discrepancy between observed data points and the predictions made by a regression model, calculated as the sum of the squared residuals. Minimizing RSS is a fundamental objective in regression analysis, as it represents the degree to which the model accurately captures the variability in the data.\n\nWorld Bank. \"GDP (Current US$) \u2013 European Union.\"\n\nWorld Bank. \"Final Consumption Expenditure (Current $) \u2013 European Union.\"",
