  "term": "Earnings Credit Rate (ECR): Understanding the Banking Metric",
  "definition": "The earnings credit rate (ECR) is a daily calculation of interest that\u00a0a bank pays on customer deposits. The earnings credit rate is often correlated with the U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) rate.\n\nECRs are rates that banks impute to offset service charges.\u00a0Because depositors leave balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, the bank will apply an ECR on those balances and use that as a credit for services.\u00a0For example, a corporate treasurer with a $250,000 collected balance receiving a 2% ECR would earn $5,000 to offset services.\u00a0ECR is often credited automatically.\n\nBanks may use ECRs to reduce fees customers pay for other banking services. These might include checking and savings accounts,\u00a0debit and credit cards,\u00a0business loans,\u00a0additional merchant services (such as credit card processing and check collection, reconciliation, and reporting),\u00a0and cash management services (e.g.,payroll).\n\nECRs are paid onidle funds, which reduce bankservice charges. Customers with larger deposits and balances tend to pay lower bank fees. ECRs are visible on most U.S. commercial account analyses and billing statements.\n\nBanks may have great discretion in determining the earnings allowance. While the earnings credit rate can offset fees, depositors must note that they are only being charged for services they use, not in\u00a0combination with others.\n\nThe notion of an earnings credit rate originated withRegulation Q (Reg Q), which prohibited banks from paying interest on deposits in checking accounts (set up for transactional purposes).Following the 1933Glass-Steagall Act, many hoped this practice would limit\u00a0loan sharking and other predatory actions.\n\nThe act subsequently supported consumers in releasing funds from checking accounts and shifting them to money market funds. Following Regulation Q, many banks decided to offer \u201csoft dollar\u201d credits on these non-interest-bearing accounts to offset banking services.\n\nFinancial instruments with a higher yield than ECRs include money-market funds or even relatively safe and liquidbond funds.\n\nTypically, the ECR is applied against\u00a0\"collected\" balances, not \"ledger\" or \"floating\" balances. Lockbox accounts and other depository accounts have float since it takes time for the deposits to clear. While these items are \"floating,\" the funds are not available. Collected balances are what you have cleared and have available to transfer or invest.\n\nWhen money market funds yield near zero (e.g., during the 2008 financial crisis), deposit accounts offering ECRs can become more attractive to corporate treasurers. Yet, in times of rising rates, these treasurers may look forfinancial instrumentswith a higher yield\u00a0than ECRs. These could include money-market funds or even relatively safe and liquid bond funds.\n\nHard interest rates are generally higher than ECRs. One reason is that ECRs are not taxable, whereas hard interest rates are.\n\nThe interest rate is a percent of your total deposits, paid to you as interest earned.\n\nThe earned credit rate is an interest rate many banks give their institutional customers on their balances.\n\nThe earnings credit rate (ECR) is a daily interest calculation\u00a0a bank pays on institutional customer deposits. It is usually calculated using the U.S. Treasury bill (T-bill) rate. The rate acts as an incentive for customers to deposit funds in non-interest-bearing accounts.\n\nU.S. Government Publishing Office. \"12 CFR 217-Capital Adequacy of Bank Holding Companies, Savings, and Loan Holding Companies, and State Member Banks (Regulation Q).\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Banking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall).\"",
