  "definition": "Education is the key to a successful financial future\n\nFinancial literacy is the set of skills needed to handle money wisely, invest effectively, and plan for a comfortable future.\n\nFinancial literacy is the essential foundation for a smart relationship with money. It is the start of a lifelong journey of managing the financial aspects of your life. Knowing the basics of money management, budgeting, saving, and investing contributes to a more successful and less stressful life.\n\nThe earlier you start to become financially literate, the better off you'll be.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nEarlier generations relied on cash, and only the relatively affluent had access to loans. Today's consumers face a world that is both more convenient and more hazardous.\n\nCredit cards, debit cards, and electronic transfers are now preferred over cash. Internet shopping made electronic payments routine. The COVID-19 pandemic virtually ended our reliance on cash, as consumers minimized human contact. Even in brick-and-mortar stores, in 2025, cash is used in only about 11% of transactions.\n\nMeanwhile, the average interest rate on credit cards is just under 23%.\n\nFinancial literacy means understanding the costs of using credit.\n\nBeing financially illiterate can lead to financial disaster, as it increases the likelihood of accumulating unsustainable debt burdens due to poor spending decisions or a lack of long-term planning. This, in turn, can lead topoor credit, bankruptcy, and housing foreclosure.\n\nThere are now more resources than ever for those wishing to educate themselves. One such resource is MyMoney.gov, a free online curriculum of financial education created by the U.S. government-sponsored Financial Literacy and Education Commission.\n\nFinancial literacy can protect people from becoming victims of financial fraud, a type of crime that is becoming more commonplace.\n\nThe range of skills that fall under the umbrella of financial literacy includes household budgeting, managing debt, evaluating financial products, choosing investments, and more.\n\nMany of these skills require at least a working knowledge of key financial concepts, such ascompound interestand thetime value of money.\n\nFinancial literacy can cover short- and long-term financial strategies. The strategy you use will depend on several factors, such as your age,\u00a0investment time horizon, andrisk tolerance.\n\nFinancial products such as mortgages, student loans, health insurance, and self-directed investment accounts have grown in importance. It is imperative to understand how to use them responsibly. It's also important to know which investment vehicles are best to use when saving for a financial goal like buying a home or for retirement.\n\nOther developments in finance, such as e-wallets, digital money, and P2P lending, can be convenient and cost-effective, but only if you know how to use them.\n\nDay-to-day living expenses, living within your means, short-term borrowing, and long-term budgeting are essential components of being financially sound. You need to be financially literate to manage these and other essential financial realities as you go through life.\n\nIt is important to plan and save enough to provide an adequate income in retirement while avoiding high levels of debt that might result in bankruptcy,\u00a0default, or foreclosure.\n\nIn its \"Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2022\" report, the U.S.\u00a0Federal Reserve System\u00a0Board of Governors found that many Americans are not prepared for retirement. Twenty-eight percent\u00a0indicated that they have no retirement savings, while about 31% of those not yet retired felt that their retirement savings were on track. Among those who have self-directed retirement savings, about 63% admitted to feeling low levels of confidence in making retirement decisions.\n\nLack of financial literacy has left millennials\u2014the largest share of the American workforce\u2014unprepared for a severe financial crisis, according to research by the TIAA Institute. Even among those who reported having a high\u00a0knowledge of personal finance, only 19% answered questions about fundamental financial concepts correctly.\n\nForty-three percent reported using expensive alternative financial services such aspayday loansand pawnshops. More than half lacked an\u00a0emergency fund\u00a0to cover three months' expenses, and 37% were financially fragile (defined as unable or unlikely to be able to come up with $2,000 within a month of an emergency).\n\nMillennials also carry large amounts of student loan and mortgage debt. In fact, 44% of them said they have too much debt.\n\nAlthough these may seem like individual problems, they can have a broad impact. A lack of personal financial awareness created widespread vulnerability to\u00a0predatory lending in the period leading up to the2008 financial crisis. Too many people were granted mortgages they couldn't afford and, inevitably, they defaulted. The impact was felt worldwide.\n\nIf you are a teen or young adult, retirement is decades away, but starting to save now is the best move you could make. The earlier you start, the longer your savings have to compound, and the more money you'll accumulate. An employer-sponsored retirement account, such as a401(k), or anindividual retirement account(IRA), are good tools to use.\n\nBroadly speaking, the benefit of financial literacy is that it empowers individuals to make smarter decisions about their finances. In addition:\n\nDeveloping financial literacy involves learning and practicing skills related tobudgeting, managing debt, paying off debts, and more. It means understanding and using credit and investment products wisely. The good news is that, no matter where you are in life and financially, it\u2019s never too late to start practicing good financial habits.\n\nHere are several practical strategies to consider.\n\nTrack how much money you receive each month and how much you spend. You can use an Excel spreadsheet, a budgeting app, or a piece of paper.\n\nYour budget should include income (paychecks, investments, alimony), fixed expenses (rent/mortgage payments, utilities, loan payments), discretionary spending (nonessentials such as eating out, shopping, and travel), and savings.\n\nPairing your budget with an expense-tracking app can help identify where you are spending each month and where you might be able to save.\n\nThis is areverse budgeting strategy. It's tempting to wait until the end of the month and hope there's money left over to save or invest. This method involves choosing and prioritizing a savings goal, such as paying for higher education.\n\nYou decide how much you want to contribute toward this goal each month. Set it aside before you divvy up the rest of your expenses, including discretionary spending.\n\nPaying bills late is a very expensive error to make.\n\nStay on top of monthly bills, making sure that your payments are always delivered on time.Automatic debits from a checking accountprevent slip-ups. Payment reminders (by email, phone, or text) can be useful.\n\nYour credit rating directly determines the interest rate you'll pay when you apply for a mortgage or a loan or open a credit card account.\n\nConsumers can request a free credit report once a year from each of the three majorcredit bureaus\u2014Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion\u2014through the federally created website AnnualCreditReport.com.\n\nReview these reports and dispute any errors by informing the credit bureau of inaccuracies. Consider spacing out your requests throughout the year to monitor your credit regularly.\n\nYou can easily track your credit rating online and for free. Keep an eye on your credit rating in your credit card account or on sites like CreditKarma.com.\n\nIn a 2024 survey by the Federal Reserve, 19% of adults in the U.S. reported they were \"just getting by\" financially. Another 8% were \"finding it difficult to get by.\"\n\nUse your budget to stay on top of debt by reducing spending and increasing repayment as needed.\n\nDevelop a debt reduction plan. One good strategy is to pay down the loan with the highest interest rate first.\n\nIf your debt is excessive, contact lenders to renegotiate repayment. Or, you can consolidate your loans or consult anon-profit debt counseling program.\n\nIf your employer offers a 401(k) retirement savings account, be sure to sign up and contribute at least the percentage necessary to get the fullemployer match.\n\nIf you don't have access to a 401(k), an individual retirement account (IRA) will get you similar benefits. They can be opened at most banks and brokerages.\n\nIf necessary, seek financial advice from professional advisors to help you determine how much money you will need to retire comfortably and develop strategies to reach your goal.\n\nEmma is a high school teacher who tries to inform her students about financial literacy through her curriculum. She educates them on the basics, such as personal budgeting, debt management, saving for college and retirement, insurance, investing, and even tax planning.\n\nEmma\u2019s students can and will use these concepts for things like renting an apartment, getting a first job, or even just paying for fun activities such as going to the movies.\n\nUnderstanding concepts such as credit cards, bank accounts, interest rates, opportunity costs,debt management, compound interest, and budgets will help her students start saving and manage the student loans that they might rely on to fund their college education. It could keep them from amassing dangerous levels of debt and threatening their credit scores.\n\nSimilarly, she expects that certain topics, such as income taxes and retirement planning, will eventually prove useful to all students, no matter what they end up doing after high school.\n\nFinancial literacy gives an individual the tools and resources they need to be financially secure for life.\n\nThe lack of financial literacy can lead to many pitfalls, such as overspending, an unsustainable debt burden, and a failure to save for retirement. These, in turn, can lead to poor credit, bankruptcy, housing foreclosure, and other negative consequences.\n\nAll the education you need is at your fingertips, and it's free.

Step 1 could be learninghow to create a budgetand stick to it.\n\nTwo commonly used personal budgeting methods are the50/20/30and 70/20/10 rules, and their simplicity is what makes them popular.\n\nThe first entails dividing your after-tax pay\u00a0into three areas: needs (50%), savings (20%), and wants (30%).\n\nThe 70/20/10 rule follows a similar blueprint, recommending that your after-tax, take-home income be divided into segments devoted to expenses (70%), savings or reducing debt (20%), and investments and charitable donations (10%).\n\nThere are five broad principles of financial literacy. Although other models may list different key components, the overarching goal of financial literacy is to teach individuals about earning, spending, saving, borrowing, and protecting their money.\n\nFinancial literacy is the knowledge of various aspects of personal finance and the ability to make smart decisions about money.\n\nIt includes preparing a budget, knowing how much to save, recognizing favorable (and unfavorable) loan terms, understanding what impacts your credit score, and choosing investment options that can be used to save for your long-term goals.\n\nCapital One. \"Cash vs Credit Card Spending Statistics.\"\n\nYahoo!
