  "term": "Internal Auditor (IA): Role and the Internal Auditing Process",
  "definition": "An internal auditor is a company employee who oversees its financial controls and recordkeeping processes and is responsible for identifying any deficiencies in them.\n\nAn internal auditor (IA) evaluates a company's financial controls and record-keeping processes for accuracy, efficiency, and compliance with relevant laws and regulations. The internal auditor is a company employee whose job is to identify and correct any deficiencies in its financial recordkeeping before they are discovered in an external audit.\n\nCompanies are not required to employ an internal auditor but many do so that problems can be prevented or addressed quickly.\n\nThe main job of an internal auditor (IA) is to identify problems and correct them before they are discovered during an external audit by an outside firm or regulatory agencies, such as theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC). One of the roles of the SEC is to regulate how companies report their financial statements to help ensure that investors have access to all of the necessary information before investing.\n\nAn internal audit generally performs the three tasks outlined below.\n\nTo achieve this goal,internal auditorswill typically perform a multitude of tasks, including examining financial statements, expense reports,inventory, financial data, budgeting and accounting practices, as well as creatingrisk assessmentsfor each department. Detailed notes are taken, interviews with employees are conducted, work schedules are supervised,physical assetsare verified, and financial statements are scrutinized to eliminate potentially damaging errors or falsehoods and find ways to boost productivity.\n\nOnce an internal auditor has completed the examination, the findings are presented in a formal report. The audit report describes how the audit was done, what it discovered and, if necessary, suggestions for what improvements could be made. It is usually presented to senior executives at the company.\n\nIf changes are recommended, it's common for an internal auditor to be asked to complete a follow-up audit to determine how well the advised changes have been executed.\n\nProperly managedpublicly traded companiesalso carry out internal audits to ensure that the company is complying with federal and state regulations, including those mandated by the SEC. However, companies must also ensure that their accounting practices follow the accounting guidelines as laid out by theGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).\n\nTheInstitute of Internal Auditors(IIA), established in 1941 and headquartered in Florida, is the international professionalorganization that sets standards, guidance, best practices, and code of ethics for practitioners.\n\nOn itswebsite, the IIA defines internal auditing as: \u201can independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations. It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness ofrisk management,control, and governance processes.\u201d\n\nSometimes, the role of internal andexternal auditorscan be confused. The main difference between the two is that internal auditors (IA) work on behalf of company management. Internal auditors are hired by the company, while external auditors are appointed by ashareholdervote.\n\nInternal auditors are employed to educate management and staff about how the business can function better. External auditors, on the other hand, have no such obligations. They are responsible for reviewing financial statements to ensure that they are accurate and conform to GAAP. Their findings are then reported back to shareholders, rather than management.\n\nAccording to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners,\u00a0the role of the external auditor is to: \u201cinspect clients\u2019 accounting records and express an opinion as to whether financial statements are presented fairly in accordance with the applicable accounting standards of the entity, such as Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) orInternational Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS).\u00a0They must assert whether financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\u201d\n\nIt is a legal requirement for all financial statements from public companies to be audited by a third-party accountant, in accordance with theSecurities Act of 1933and theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nMany companies choose to employ an internal auditor, despite not being legally obligated to do so. Robust internal audits are viewed as a key way to correct issues quickly, maintain a good reputation, and prevent money from being wasted. Reports filed by internal auditors (IA) can help companies to prosper and operate at maximum efficiency. For this reason, many executives view them as a necessary expense.\n\nThe job of an internal auditor is essentially to help catch and fix issues before an external auditor has the chance to so do. For this reason, many executives view them as a necessary expense.\n\nInstitute of Internal Auditors. \"About the IIA.\"\n\nAssociation of Certified Fraud Examiners. \"External Auditor.\"\n\nGovernment Publishing Office. \"Securities Exchange Act of 1934,\" Page 91.\n\nGovernment Publishing Office. \"Securities Act of 1933,\" Page 72.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"All About Auditors: What Investors Need to Know.\"",
