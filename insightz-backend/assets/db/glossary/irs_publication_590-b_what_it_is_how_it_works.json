But the biggest distinction isbetween the traditional and the Roth IRA:\n\nAn IRA distribution for higher education expenses or a first-time home purchase isn't subject to the 10% early withdrawal penalty.\n\nIRS Publication 590-B is organized to explain the different tax implications of the traditional and Roth types of IRA accounts:\n\nChapters 1 and 2 of IRS Publication 590-B explain all the rules for the traditional IRA and the Roth IRA, respectively. Chapter 1 covers when you can withdraw money and at what age you must withdraw money. It also includes penalties for early withdrawals from traditional IRAs.\n\nChapter 3 covers permitted early withdrawals used to pay for damage caused by natural disasters. As of the latest IRS Publication 590-B, for 2023 tax returns, a qualified disaster recovery distribution must meet certain criteria as described in theSECURE 2.0 Act of 2022. Section 331 of the latest SECURE Act allows victims of a\u00a0qualifiednatural disasterto withdraw up to $22,000 from their retirement account without penalty. The withdrawal is treated as gross income over three years without penalty (effective as of the passage of the bill). All such distributions require repayment of the money to avoid a penalty later.\n\nAn introductory section includes a table clarifying the differences between traditional and Roth IRAs, rules for required distributions, taxation of these accounts, and regulations for filingForm 8606for non-deductible IRAs.\u00a0This is the form that must be filed to report distributions from any type of IRA.\n\nA later section provides general information on getting help with tax-related issues.\n\nAppendix A is a worksheet for determining yourrequired minimum distribution (RMD), and Appendix B contains a life expectancy table needed to calculate RMDs.\n\nKeep an eye on the penalties detailed in Publication 590-B, and the exceptions to those penalties.\n\nFor example, most early distributions trigger a 10% penalty. The penalty goes up to 25% if money is withdrawn during the first two years of participation in a SIMPLE IRA.However, a withdrawal forqualified higher education expensesor first-time home purchase isn't subject to the penalty.\n\nThe IRS has numerous publications explaining the ins and outs of qualified retirement plans.\n\nIRSPublication 590-Bdetails the tax implications of taking money out of any type of IRA, before or after retirement.\u00a0It specifies when you can't withdraw money without paying a penalty and when you must withdraw money via required minimum distributions in retirement.\n\nThe IRS provides updates about related developments before a new version of Publication 590-B is published on a web page titled \"About Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\" These may include legislation enacted after the current edition was published.\n\n\"2023 IRS Publication 590-B,\" the latest edition available as of May 2024, has 69 pages.
