  "term": "Peer Group: Definition, How It's Used, Example, Pros & Cons",
  "definition": "The term peer group refers to a group of individuals or companies that share similar characteristics with one another. These characteristics may be age, education, ethnic background, size,industry, or sector. Peer groups are known for their influential nature as they are able to shape the decisions of members of the group. As such, peer groups often contain hierarchies, with clear leaders who sit at the top. Peer groups are often used in analysis in a number of academic and professional fields.\n\nAs noted above, peer groups contain a number of people or other entities that share one or more similar characteristics. Peer groups allow individuals to be grouped together by certain defining features, such as age,income, education, race, and/or gender. Qualities among members for corporate peer groups include size, industry,sector, and/or financial position.\n\nPeer groups are used in a number of different fields, such asfinanceandmarketing, as well as sociology. They are known for the influence they have among group members. They consist of hierarchies, which place one or a few individual group members at the top. These members can often shape the actions and decisions of the other group members.\n\nPeer group analysis or peer comparison involves an apples-to-apples comparison. This means the constituents of the peer group should be more or less similar to one another. Comparisons allow professionals to identify trends and anomalies in behavior and outcomes, and give them an opportunity to figure outefficienciesand opportunities:\n\nIf not immediately obvious, peer groups are sometimes\u00a0identified by a given company in its10-Kfiling and almost always in itsproxy filing, though the latter can be more expansive in terms of specific business sectors and is used to set executive compensation plans.\n\nInsurance companies compile peer groups to underwrite life or health insurance policies on certain demographics, such as age-related groups or those who do or don't smoke.\n\nPeer comparisonis one of the most widely used and accepted methods of equity analysis used by professional analysts, individual investors, and professionals.\n\nBecause companies in a peer group share similar traits, they lend themselves to relative value analysis. Peer group analysis establishes avaluationfor stocks in investment research, as long as the group consists of companies similar to the one being researched. This is especially key when it comes to business areas andmarket capitalization. Investors can use this analysis to spot valuationanomaliesfor certain stocks.\n\nFor example, a stock trading at anearnings multipleof 15x (compared with a 10x multiple for its peer group) may be consideredovervalued. Investors can uncover reasons for the higher earnings multiple and ultimately determine that it is deserved.\n\nRelative valuation among peers in a group can be efficient and effective, quickly showing which stocks may be\u00a0overvalued, and which might make good additions to a portfolio. While there are other methods to determine when a stock is worth buying, such as discountedcash flowortechnical analysis, peer comparison analysis remains a key tool for uncoveringundervaluedstocks.\n\nBecause the data necessary to conduct the analysis is generally public and readily accessible on financial websites, it is easy for anybody to begin employing this method of analysis in order to identify opportunities.\n\nPeer group comparisons are also called comparables or comps.\n\nPeer groups are important in advertising and marketing, especially in the age ofsocial media. Leaders in the group or those who are at the top of the hierarchical ladder are commonly known as influencers. Professionals study peer groups to show how they influence buying patterns and consumertrendsfor advertising and product development purposes.\n\nPeer group analysis helps shape many decisions in the financial and investment worlds. There are a number of different benefits to using peer groups, especially in investment analysis. But just like any other analytical tool, there are drawbacks to this form of analysis as well. We've listed some of the most common ones below.\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits of using peer group analysis is that it helps investors and analysts uncover undervalued stocks. This is often accomplished by analyzing different metrics, includingleverageandprofitabilityamong others. Doing so allows the individual to determine companies that should carry higher-than-average valuations. A stock may be considered a buying opportunity if the current valuation is lower than what seems reasonable.\n\nInvestors and professionals don't have to go far to get the information they need to perform peer group analysis. Data is easily available, either on company websites or through filings done with theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC). This means the individual doesn't need to do exhaustive research.\n\nConducting peer comparisons give investors a chance to determine certain anomalies and trends that arise with different companies and in the market in general.\n\nDoing apeer comparisonisn't as easy as it seems. That's because quantitative factors aren't the only considerations. In fact, there are qualitative issues that must be taken into account. This means that the analysis can be fairly subjective.\n\nPeer groups often come with certain biases, which can sway an analyst or investor's analysis. For example, some groups come withsurvivorship bias. This means that the peer group may not contain any companies that underperform. This type of analysis, therefore, doesn't take companies that have gone under or phased out of the group into account.\n\nThere may not be very many companies in the peer group. When this is the case, peer comparison becomes ineffective. In order for it to work, there needs to get a sizeable group of companies that can be compared to one another.\n\nHelps uncover buying opportunities for undervalued securities\n\nAccessing data is easily available for comparison\n\nAllows anomalies and trends to be identified\n\nMay be subjective because some investors also consider qualitative factors into account\n\nSurvivorship bias doesn't account for members that are phased out of the group\n\nMay not be enough companies in the group\n\nPeer groups refer to companies that are in the same industry or sector. These are competitors that are roughly the same size. Peer groups can be found in analyst research reports or an individual company's financial statements.\n\nLockheed Martin is an aerospace, defense, and security company headquartered in Maryland. According to the company's 2017 proxy statement, its peer group consists of other similar companies as its peers, including General Dynamics, Raytheon, and Northrup Grumman. It also lists Caterpillar, UPS, and 3M.\n\nThere are several different types of peer groups, including social groups (cliques, sports teams, etc). In investing and finance, peers may be grouped by industry or sector (consumer staples, retail, telecoms), size (usually by market cap), financial health (profitability, capital structure), or business factors (business models, location, seasonality).\n\nPeer group analysis is a process involving the comparison of entities that share similar characteristics. It is an apples-to-apples comparison of subjects that are fairly similar to one another. This kind of analysis allows for the identification of trends and anomalies in behavior and outcomes.\n\nA peer group index is one that groups individual companies together into a single, benchmark index. For instance, theS&P 500can be considered a peer group index. This index is comprised of 500 of the largest public companies in the United States and is generally considered the best gauge of U.S. large-cap equities.\n\nA peer group average is considered one of the most effective and efficient ways to determine the valuation of a security. Put simply, investors can use certain metrics drawn from corporate financial statements to assess a certain company's stock price compared to its peers.\n\nCompanies are grouped into peer groups for ratio analysis as part of fundamental analysis. It allows researchers to determine individual company liquidity, efficiencies, as well as profitability. This is done by examining each company's past and current financial statements and comparing them with one another. Some of the most popular ratios includeprice-to-earnings (P/E),price-to-book, and price-to-dividend ratios.\n\nPeer groups consist of similar entities that share one or more characteristics in common. They serve a very important purpose in many different fields of study. They can be one of the most useful tools when it comes to equity analysis for investors and financial professionals. Anyone can perform peer group comparisons using information that is widely available on corporate websites or through the SEC.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide investment advice.
