  "definition": "Accounting profit is a company's totalearnings, calculated according togenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP). It includes theexplicit costsof doing business, such as operating expenses, depreciation, interest,and taxes.\n\nProfitis a widely monitored financialmetricthat is regularly used to evaluate the health of a company.\n\nFirms often publish various versions of profit in theirfinancial statements. Some of these figures take into account allrevenueandexpenseitems,laid out in the income statement. Others are creative interpretations put together by management and their accountants.\n\nAccounting profit, also referred to as bookkeeping profit or financial profit, isnet incomeearned after subtracting all dollar costs from total\u00a0revenue. In effect, it shows the amount of money a firm has left over after deducting the\u00a0explicit costs\u00a0of running the business.\n\nThe costs that need to be considered include the following:\n\nLike accounting profit, economic profitdeducts explicit costs from revenue. Where they differ is that economic\u00a0profit also usesimplicit costs; the various opportunity costs a company incurs when allocating resources elsewhere.\n\nExamples of implicit costs include:\n\nFor example, if a person invested $100,000 to start a business and earned $120,000 in profit, their accounting profit would be $20,000.Economic profit, however, would add implicit costs, such as theopportunity costof $50,000, which represents the salary they would have earned if they kept their day job. As such, the business owner would have an economic loss of $30,000 ($120,000 - $100,000 - $50,000).\n\nEconomic profit\u00a0is more of a theoretical calculation based on alternative actions that could have been taken, while accounting profit calculates what actually occurred and the measurable results\u00a0for the period. Accounting profit has many uses, including for tax declarations. Economic profit, on the other hand, is mainly just calculated to help management make a decision.\n\nCompanies often choose to supplement accounting profit with their own subjective take on their profit position. One such example is underlying profit. This popular, widely-used metric often excludesone-time chargesor infrequent occurrences and is regularly flagged by management as a key number for investors to pay attention to.\n\nThe goal of underlying profit is to eliminate the impact that random events, such as a natural disaster, have on earnings. Losses or gains that do not regularly crop up, such asrestructuring chargesor the buying or selling of land or property, are usually not taken into account because they do not occur often and, as a result, are not deemed to reflect the everyday costs of running the business.\n\nCompany A operates in the manufacturing industry and sells widgets for $5. In January, it sold 2,000 widgets for a total monthly revenue of $10,000. This is the first number entered into its income statement.\n\nThecost of goods sold(COGS) is then subtracted from revenue to arrive at gross revenue. If it costs $1 to produce a widget, the company's COGS would be $2,000, and its net sales would be $8,000, or ($10,000 - $2,000).\n\nAfter calculating the company's gross revenue, all operating costs are subtracted to arrive at the company's operating profit, or earnings before interest, taxes,depreciation, andamortization(EBITDA). If the company's only overhead was a monthly employee expense of $5,000, its operating profit would be $3,000, or ($8,000 - $5,000).\n\nOnce a company derives its operating profit, it then assesses allnon-operating expenses, such as interest, depreciation, amortization, and taxes. In this example, the company has no debt but has depreciating assets at astraight line depreciationof $1,000 a month. It also has a corporate tax rate of 35%.\n\nThe depreciation amount is first subtracted to arrive at the company's earnings before taxes (EBT) of $1,000, or ($2,000 - $1,000). Corporate taxes are then assessed at $350, to give the company an accounting profit of $650, calculated as ($1,000 - ($1,000 * 0.35).",
