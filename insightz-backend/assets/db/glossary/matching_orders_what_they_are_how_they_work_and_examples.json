  "term": "Matching Orders: What They Are, How They Work, and Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nMatching orders is the process by which a securitiesexchangepairs one or more unsolicited buy orders to one or more sell orders to make trades. This can be contrasted withrequests for a quote(RFQ) in a security to proceed with a trade.\n\nIf one investor wants to buy a quantity of stock and another wants to sell the same quantity at the same price, their orders match, and a transaction is effected. The work of pairing these orders is the process of order matching whereby exchanges identify buy orders, orbids, with corresponding\u00a0sell orders, orasks, to execute them. Over the past decade, this process has become almost entirely automated.\n\nMatching the orders of buyers and sellers is the primary work of specialists andmarket makersin the exchanges. The matches happen\u00a0when compatible buy orders and sell orders for the samesecurityare submitted in close proximity in price and time.\n\nGenerally, a buy order and a sell order are compatible if the maximum price of the buy order matches or exceeds the minimum price of the sell order. From there, the computerized, order-matching systems of different exchanges use a variety of methods to prioritize orders for matching.\n\nToday, most exchanges matchordersusing computer algorithms; but historically, brokers matched orders through face-to-face interactions on a trading floor in an open-outcry auction.\n\nQuick, accurate order matching is a critical component of an exchange. Investors, particularly active investors andday traders, will look for ways to minimize inefficiencies in trading from every possible source. A slow order-matching system may cause buyers or sellers to execute trades at less-than-ideal prices, eating into investors\u2019 profits. If some order-matching protocols tend to favor buyers, and others favor sellers, these methods become exploitable.\n\nThis is one of the areas wherehigh-frequency trading(HFT) was able to improve efficiency. Exchanges aim to prioritize trades in a way that benefits buyers and sellers equally so as to maximize order volume\u2014the lifeblood of the exchange.\n\nAll major markets have transitioned to electronic matching. Each securities exchange uses its own specific algorithm to match orders. Broadly, they fall under two categories:first-in-first-out(FIFO) andpro-rata.\n\nUnder a basic FIFO algorithm, or price-time-priority algorithm, the earliest active buy order at the highest price takes priority over any subsequent order at that price, which in turn takes priority over any active buy order at a lower price. For example, if a buy order for 200 shares of stock at $90 per share precedes an order for 50 shares of the same stock at the same price, the system must match the entire 200-share order to one or more sell orders before beginning to match any portion of the 50-share order.\n\nUnder a basic pro-rata algorithm, the system prioritizes active orders at a particular price, proportional to the relative size of each order. For example, if both a 200-share buy order and a 50-share buy order at the same price are active when a compatible 200-share sell order arrives, the system will match 160 shares to the 200-share buy order and 40 shares to the 50-share buy order.\n\nSince the sell order is not large enough to fulfill both buy orders, the system will partially fill both. In this case, the pro-rata matching algorithm fills 80 percent of each order.",
