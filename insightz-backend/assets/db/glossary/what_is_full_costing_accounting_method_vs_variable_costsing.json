  "term": "What Is Full Costing? Accounting Method Vs. Variable Costsing",
  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nFull costing is anaccounting methodused to determine the complete end-to-end cost of producing products or services.\n\nAlso known as \"full costs\" or \"absorption costing,\u201d it is required in most common accounting methodologies, includinggenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP),International Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS), and reporting standards for income tax purposes.\n\nWhen using the full costing method, alldirect,fixed, andvariable overheadcosts are assigned to the end product.\n\nIn full costing accounting, these various expenses move with the product (or service) throughinventory accountsuntil the product is sold. Theincome statementwill then recognize these as expenses undercosts of goods sold(COGS).\n\nThe alternative to the full costing method is known asvariableor direct costing. The treatment of fixed manufacturing overhead costs, such as salaries and building leases, isthe primary difference between these two different accounting styles.\n\nCompanies that use variable costing separate theseoperating expensesfrom production costs. In short, they seek to establish the expenses incurred during the manufacturing process, independent of the everyday costs of running a business.\n\nUnder the variable costing method, fixed manufacturing overhead costs are expensed during the period they are incurred. In contrast, the full costing approach recognizes fixed manufacturing overhead costs as an expense when goods or services are sold. Choosing one method over another can have sizable effects on the reporting offinancial statements.\n\nIn practice, neither costing method is right or wrong.\u00a0Some organizations will find variable costing more effective, while others will prefer full costing. The usefulness of method selection boils down to managerial attitude, behavior, andorganizational designas it relates to accurate input cost capture and valuation.\n\nAs more businesses move tojust-in-time(JIT) or related streamlined production procedures and inventory systems, in many ways, direct or full costing methods lose their significance, because fewer costs and expenses are tied up in production processes.\n\nCompliant With Reporting Rules:One of the biggest benefits of full costing is that it complies with GAAP. Even if a company decides to use variable costing in-house, it isrequired by law to use full costingin any external financial statements it publishes. Full costing is also the method that a company is required to use for calculating and filing its taxes.\n\nAccounts for All Production Costs:Factoring in all expenses provides investors and management with a complete picture of how much itcosts a company to manufactureits products. Establishing the totalcost per unithelps businesses to determine suitable pricing for goods and services.\n\nEasier to Track Profits:Full costing presents a more accurate idea of profitability than variable costing if all of the products are not sold during the sameaccounting periodwhen they are manufactured. This can be especially important for a company thatramps upproduction well in advance of an anticipated seasonal increase in sales.\n\nDifficult to Compare Product Lines:Full costing also has several drawbacks. For example, taking into account all expenses, including those not directly associated with production, may make it slightly harder for management to compare the profitability of different product lines.\n\nImpacts Efforts to Improve Operational Efficiency:Management teams using full costing will also find it more challenging to runcost-volume-profit(CVP) analysis, which is used to determine how many products a company must manufacture and sell to reach the point of profitability, and improve operational efficiency. If fixed costs are an especially large part of totalproduction costs, it is difficult to determine variations in costs that occur at different production levels.\n\nCan Skew Profit:Another major flaw of full costing is that it can potentially mislead investors. Fixed costs\u00a0are not deducted from revenues unless all of the company's manufactured products are sold, meaning that a company's profit level can appear better than it actually is during a specified accounting period.",
