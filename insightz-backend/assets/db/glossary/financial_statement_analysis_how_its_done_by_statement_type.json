  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nFinancial statement analysis is the process of analyzing a company\u2019sfinancial statementsfor decision-making purposes. External stakeholders use it to understand the overall health of an organization and to evaluate financial performance and business value. Internal constituents use it as a monitoring tool for managing the finances.\n\nThe financial statements of a company record important financial data on every aspect of a business\u2019s activities. As such, they can be evaluated on the basis of past, current, and projected performance.\n\nIn general, financial statements are centered aroundgenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)in the United States. These principles require a company to create and maintain three main financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement. Public companies have stricter standards for financial statement reporting. Public companies must follow GAAP, which requires accrual accounting.Private companies have greater flexibility in their financial statement preparation and have the option to use either accrual or cash accounting.\n\nSeveral techniques are commonly used as part of financial statement analysis. Three of the most important techniques arehorizontal analysis,vertical analysis, andratio analysis. Horizontal analysis compares data horizontally, by analyzing values of line items across two or more years. Vertical analysis looks at the vertical effects that line items have on other parts of the business and the business\u2019s proportions. Ratio analysis uses important ratio metrics to calculate statistical relationships.\n\nCompanies use the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement to manage the operations of their business and to provide transparency to their stakeholders. All three statements are interconnected and create different views of a company\u2019s activities and performance.\n\nThe balance sheet is a report of a company\u2019s financial worth in terms of book value. It is broken into three parts to include a company\u2019sassets,liabilities, andshareholder equity. Short-term assets such as cash and accounts receivable can tell a lot about a company\u2019s operational efficiency; liabilities include the company\u2019s expense arrangements and the debt capital it is paying off; and shareholder equity includes details on equity capital investments and retained earnings from periodic net income. The balance sheet must balance assets and liabilities to equal shareholder equity. This figure is considered a company\u2019sbook valueand serves as an important performance metric that increases or decreases with the financial activities of a company.\n\nThe income statement breaks down the revenue that a company earns against the expenses involved in its business to provide a bottom line, meaning the net profit or loss. The income statement is broken into three parts that help to analyze business efficiency at three different points. It begins with revenue and the direct costs associated with revenue to identifygross profit. It then moves tooperating profit, which subtracts indirect expenses like marketing costs, general costs, and depreciation. Finally, after deducting interest and taxes, thenet incomeis reached.\n\nBasicanalysis of the income statementusually involves the calculation of gross profit margin, operating profit margin, and net profit margin, which each divide profit by revenue. Profit margin helps to show where company costs are low or high at different points of the operations.\n\nThe cash flow statement provides an overview of the company\u2019scash flowsfrom operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. Net income is carried over to the cash flow statement, where it is included as the top line item for operating activities. Like its title, investing activities include cash flows involved with firm-wide investments. The financing activities section includes cash flow from both debt and equity financing. The bottom line shows how much cash a company has available.\n\nCompanies and analysts also use free cash flow statements and other valuation statements toanalyze the value of a company. Free cash flow statements arrive at anet present valueby discounting the free cash flow that a company is estimated to generate over time. Private companies may keep a valuation statement as they progress toward potentially going public.\n\nFinancial statements are maintained by companies daily and used internally for business management. In general, both internal and external stakeholders use the same corporate finance methodologies for maintaining business activities and evaluating overallfinancial performance.\n\nWhen doing comprehensive financial statement analysis, analysts typically use multiple years of data to facilitate horizontal analysis. Each financial statement is also analyzed with vertical analysis to understand how different categories of the statement are influencing results. Finally,ratio analysis can be used to isolatesome performance metrics in each statement and bring together data points across statements collectively.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of some of the most common ratio metrics:\n\nThemain point of financial statement analysisis to evaluate a company\u2019s performance or value through a company\u2019s balance sheet, income statement, or statement of cash flows. By using a number of techniques, such as horizontal, vertical, or ratio analysis, investors may develop a more nuanced picture of a company\u2019s financial profile.\n\nMost often, analysts will use three main techniques for analyzing a company\u2019s financial statements.\n\nFirst, horizontal analysis involves comparing historical data. Usually, the purpose of horizontal analysis is to detect growth trends across different time periods.\n\nSecond, vertical analysis compares items on a financial statement in relation to each other. For instance, an expense item could be expressed as a percentage of company sales.\n\nFinally, ratio analysis, a central part of fundamental equity analysis, compares line-item data. Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, earnings per share, or dividend yield are examples of ratio analysis.\n\nAn analyst may first look at a number of ratios on a company\u2019s income statement to determine how efficiently it generates profits and shareholder value. For instance, gross profit margin will show the difference between revenues and the cost of goods sold. If the company has a higher gross profit margin than its competitors, this may indicate a positive sign for the company. At the same time, the analyst may observe that the gross profit margin has been increasing over nine fiscal periods, applying a horizontal analysis to the company\u2019s operating trends.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cCash Versus Accrual Basis of Accounting: An Introduction,\u201d Page 3 (Page 7 of PDF).\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 538 (01/2022), Accounting Periods and Methods: Methods You Can Use.\u201d",
