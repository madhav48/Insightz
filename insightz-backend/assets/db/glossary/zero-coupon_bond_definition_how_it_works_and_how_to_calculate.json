  "term": "Zero-Coupon Bond: Definition, How It Works, and How to Calculate",
  "definition": "Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value is the investor's return.\n\nA zero-coupon bond is an investment in debt that doesn't pay interest. It instead trades at a deep discount. The profit is realized at its maturity date when the bond is redeemed for its full face value.\n\nA zero-coupon bond is also known as an accrual bond.\n\nSome bonds are issued as zero-coupon instruments. Others are transformed into zero-coupon instruments after a financial institution strips them of their coupons and repackages them as zero-coupon bonds.\n\nThey offer payment at face value at maturity so zero-coupon bonds tend to fluctuate in price on the secondary market much more thancoupon bonds.\n\nA bond is a tool for a company or a government to borrow money. Investors who purchase bonds are effectively acting as lenders to the issuing entity. The investors earn a return in the form ofcoupon paymentsthat are made semiannually or annually throughout the life of the bond.\n\nThe bondholder is repaid an amount equal to theface valueof the bond when thebond matures. The par or face value of a corporate bond is typically stated as $1,000.\n\nInvestors can purchase the bond below its par value if a corporate bond is issued at a discount. An investor who purchases a bond for $920 at a discount will receive $1,000 when it reaches its maturity date. The $80 return plus coupon payments are the investor's earnings for holding the bond.\n\nNot all bonds have coupon payments, however. Those that do not are referred to as zero-coupon bonds.\n\nZero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount, and they repay the par value at maturity. The difference between the purchase price and the par value represents the investor's return. The payment received by the investor is equal to the principal invested plus the interest earned, compounded semiannually at a stated yield.\n\nThe interest earned on a zero-coupon bond is animputed interest. It's an estimated interest rate for the bond and not an established interest rate. A bond with a face value of $20,000 that matures in 20 years with a 5.5% yield may be purchased for roughly $6,855. The investor will receive $20,000 at the end of the 20 years.\n\nThe difference between $20,000 and $6,855 is $13,145. This represents theinterest that compoundsautomatically until the bond matures. Imputed interest is sometimes referred to as \"phantom interest.\"\n\nThe imputed interest on the bond is subject to federalincome tax.No coupon payments are made on zero-coupon bonds until maturity but investors may still have to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on the imputed interest that accrues each year.\n\nPurchasing a municipal zero-coupon bond, buying zero-coupon bonds in a tax-exempt account, or purchasing a corporate zero-coupon bond that has tax-exempt status are a few ways to avoid paying income taxes on these securities.\n\nThe price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated like this:\n\nAn investor would be willing to pay the following if they wanted to make a 6% return on a bond with a $25,000 par value that's due to mature in three\u00a0years:\n\nThe bond would be sold to the investor at $20,991 / $25,000 = 84% of the face value if the debtor accepted this offer. The investor gains $25,000 - $20,991 = $4,009 at maturity. This translates to 6% interest per year.\n\nThe greater the length of time until the bond matures, the less the investor pays for it, and vice versa.\n\nThe maturity dates on zero-coupon bonds are usually long-term with initial maturities of at least 10 years. These long-term maturity dates let investors plan for long-range goals such as saving for a child\u2019s college education. An investor can put up a small amount of money that grows over time with the bond's deep discount.\n\nZero-coupon bonds can be issued from a variety of sources including the U.S. Treasury, state and local government entities, and corporations. Most zero-coupon bonds trade on the major exchanges.\n\nPayment of interest or coupons is the key difference between a zero-coupon and a regular bond.\n\nRegular bonds are also called coupon bonds. They pay interest over the life of the bond and then repay the principal at maturity.\n\nA zero-coupon bond doesn't pay interest but instead trades at a deep discount. This gives investors a profit at maturity when they redeem the bond for its full face value.\n\nThe primary factor to consider is the imputed interest rate that the investor will earn at maturity. The price of a zero-coupon bond can be calculated using this equation:\n\nZero-coupon bond price = Maturity value \u00f7 (1 + required interest rate)^number years to maturity.\n\nImputed interest, sometimes referred to as \"phantom interest,\" is an estimated interest rate. The imputed interest on the bond is subject to income tax. The IRS uses an accretive method when calculating the imputed interest onTreasury bonds. It sets a minimum interest rate relative to imputed interest and the original price discount.\n\nZero-coupon bonds are an alternative to better-known coupon bonds that pay regular interest to their investors. Zero-coupon bonds pay no interest, but they're purchased at a deep discount and repaid at full price.\n\nMost zero-coupon bonds are long-term issues. Ten or more years is common. They're often used to finance a long-range goal such as paying for a child's college education.\n\nOne big thing to consider: The owners of zero-coupon bonds pay a \"phantom interest\" tax on the bonds' earnings through the years they hold them.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Zero Coupon Bond.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Topic No. 403, Interest Received.\"",
