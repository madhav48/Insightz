  "definition": "An investment center is a business unit in a firm that can utilize capital to contribute directly to a company's profitability.\u00a0You may compare and contrast some parallels like the terms \"profit center\" or \"cost center.\"\n\nCompanies evaluate the performance of an investment center according to therevenuesit brings in through investments incapital assetscompared to the overall expenses.\n\nAn investment center is sometimes called an investment division.\n\nThe different departmental units within a company are categorized as either generating profits or running expenses. Organizational departments are classified into three different units:cost center,profit center, and investment center. A cost center focuses on minimizing costs and is assessed by how much expenses it incurs.\n\nExamples of departments that make up the cost center are the human resource and marketing departments. A profit center is evaluated on the amount of profit that is generated and attempts to increase profits by increasing sales or reducing costs. Units that fall under a profit center include the manufacturing and sales department. In addition to departments, profit and cost centers can be divisions, projects, teams,subsidiarycompanies, production lines, or machines.\n\nAn investment center is a center that is responsible for its own revenues, expenses, andassetsand manages its ownfinancial statementswhich are typically abalance sheetand anincome statement. Because costs, revenue, and assets have to be identified separately, an investment center would usually be a subsidiary company or a division.\n\nOne can classify an investment center as an extension of the profit center where revenues and expenses are measured. However, only in an investment center are the assets employed also measured and compared to the profit made.\n\nInstead of looking at how much profit or expenses a unit has as with a firm's profit centers, the investment center focuses on generating returns on the fixed assets orworking capitalinvested specifically in the investment center.\n\nUnlike a profit center, an investment center might invest in activities and assets that are not necessarily related to the company's operations. It could be investments oracquisitionsof other companies enabling diversification of the company's risk. A new trend is the proliferation of venture arms within established corporations to enable investments in the next wave of trends through acquiring stakes instartups.\n\nIn simpler terms, the performance of a department is analyzed by examining the assets and resources given to the department and how well it used those assets to generate revenues compared with its overall expenses. By focusing onreturn on capital, the investment center philosophy gives a more accurate picture of how much a division is contributing to the economic well-being of the company.\n\nUsing this approach of measuring a department\u2019s performance, managers have insight as to whether to increase capital to increase profits or whether to shut down a department that is inefficiently making use of its invested capital. An investment center that cannot earn a return on invested funds in excess of the cost of those funds is deemed not economically profitable.\n\nAn investment center is different from a cost center, which does not directly contribute to the company\u2019s profit and is evaluated according to the cost it incurs to run its operations. Moreover, unlike a profit center, investment centers can utilize capital in order to purchase other assets.\n\nBecause of this complexity, companies have to use a variety of metrics, includingreturn on investment(ROI),residual income, andeconomic value added(EVA) to evaluate the performance of a department. For example, a manager can compare the ROI to the cost of capital to evaluate a division\u2019s performance. If the ROI is 9% and the cost of capital is 13%, the manager can conclude that the investment center is managing its capital or assets poorly.",
