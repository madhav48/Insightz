  "term": "Portfolio Management: Definition, Types, and Strategies",
  "definition": "Portfolio management is the art of selecting and overseeing a group of investments that meet the long-term financial objectives and risk tolerance of a client, a company, or an institution.\n\nPortfolio management is the process ofbalancing risk against performance, determining the right mix of assets to optimize returns for the amount of risk you're willing to accept.\n\nWhile many people manage their own investment portfolios, many rely on professional portfolio managers. Regardless of approach, successfully managing a portfolio requires an in-depth understanding of the key building blocks that drive investment success, including thoughtful asset allocation,proper diversification, and disciplined rebalancing practices.\n\nProfessional licensed portfolio managers work on behalf of clients, while individuals can build and manage their portfolios. In either case, the portfolio manager's ultimate goal is to maximize the investments' expected return within an appropriate level of risk exposure.\n\nPortfolio management requires the ability to weigh the strengths and weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of a spectrum of investments. These choices involve trade-offs, from debt versus equity to domestic versus international and growth versus safety.\n\nPortfolio management is a critical investment practice used by two types of entities: individual andinstitutional investors. These categories have distinct strategies, goals, and resources. Understanding the different approaches and needs of these two types of investors can provide greater insight into how portfolio management techniques are applied across the financial spectrum.\n\nIndividual investors often focus onpersonal wealth and future needs, managing smaller amounts of money with varying degrees of professional assistance. In contrast, institutional investors manage large-scale assets with a professional approach tailored to fulfill specific financial obligations and institutional goals. Both groups, however, aim to improve their returns by managing their portfolios to suit specific circumstances and financial objectives.\n\nIndividual investors have a range of personal goals, risk preferences, and resources. Their objectives include saving for retirement, accumulating wealth for large purchases, funding education for children, or building an emergency fund. Each goal requires a different strategy or risk profile.\n\nIndividual investors' risk tolerance andinvestment knowledgevary greatly. Their approach to managing investments can range from highly engaged active trading and rebalancing to relying on automated or professional management. As financial markets have evolved and technology has widened access to investment information, individual investors have had wider prospects to tailor their investment strategies to meet their financial objectives.\n\nInstitutional investors are entities that pool large sums of money and invest those funds into various financial instruments and assets: pension funds, endowments, foundations, banks, and insurance companies. Each has specific objectives and constraints that influence its portfolio management strategies. Many institutional investors have long-term financial obligations that cause them to focus on long-term growth and sustainability over short-term gains.\n\nIn addition, institutional investors are often under strict regulatory oversight to ensure they manage their beneficiaries' funds responsibly. Moreover,ethical and social governanceissues increasingly influence their investment decisions. Risk management is a crucial part of the work of an institutional portfolio manager since these entities must balance the need for profitability with the imperative of preserving capital to meet future liabilities.\n\nInstitutional investors' investment approaches are typically conservative compared with individual investors, focusing on long-term stability, capital preservation, and meeting future obligations. Indeed, each type of institutional investor has distinct strategies and objectives, but all share the common goal of responsibly managing large pools of capital to meet the needs of their stakeholders.\n\nPortfolio management can be either passive or active.\n\nPerformance: Historically, over long periods, underperforms\n\nPerformance: Historically, over long periods, performs like the market\n\nPassive management is the set-it-and-forget-it long-term strategy. It may involve investing in one or more ETFs. This is commonly referred to as indexing orindex investing. Those who build indexed portfolios may use modern portfolio theory to help them optimize the mix.\n\nActive management involves attempting to beat an index's performance by actively buying and selling individual stocks and other assets. Closed-end funds and many mutual funds are generally actively managed. Active managers may use any of a wide range of quantitative or qualitative models to aid in their evaluation of potential investments.\n\nInvestors who use an active management approach have fund managers or brokers to buy and sell stocks in an attempt to outperform a specific index, such as the\u00a0Standard & Poor's 500\u00a0Index or the Russell 1000 Index. Often, these investors will also useportfolio management softwareto help them track their investments.\n\nAn actively managed investment fund has an individual portfolio manager, co-managers, or a team of managers actively making investment decisions for the fund. The success of an actively managed fund depends on a combination of in-depth research, market forecasting, and the expertise of the portfolio manager or management team.\n\nPortfolio managers engaged in active investing pay close attention tomarket trends, shifts in the economy, changes to the political landscape, and news that affects companies. This data is used to time the purchase or sale of investments to take advantage of market irregularities. Active managers claim that these processes will boost\u00a0the potential for returns higher than those achieved by simply tracking the holdings on a particular index.\n\nTrying to beat the market inevitably involves market risk. Indexing eliminates this particular risk, as there is less probability of human error in selecting the index stocks. Index funds are also traded less often, which means that they incur lower expense ratios and are more tax-efficient than actively managed funds.\n\nPassive portfolio management, also known as index fund management, aims to duplicate the return of a particular market index or benchmark. Managers buy the same stocks listed on the index, using the same weighting that they represent in the index.\n\nA passive strategy portfolio can be structured as an ETF, a mutual fund, or a\u00a0unit investment trust. Index funds are branded as passively managed because each has a portfolio manager whose job is to replicate the index rather than select the assets bought or sold.\n\nManagement fees\u00a0assessed on passive portfolios or funds are typically far lower than those of active management strategies.\n\nAnother critical element of portfolio management is the concept ofdiscretionary and non-discretionary management. This approach dictates what a third party may be allowed to do regarding your portfolio.\n\nA discretionary or non-discretionary management style is only relevant if you have an independent broker managing your portfolio. If you want the broker to execute trades that you have explicitly approved, you must opt for a non-discretionary investment account. The broker may advise you on strategy and suggest investment moves. However, without your approval, the broker is simply an advisor who must follow your instructions.\n\nMeanwhile, some investors would prefer to leave all decisions to their broker or financial manager. In these situations, the financial advisor can buy or sell securities without the investor's approval. However, the advisor still has afiduciary responsibilityto act in the client's best interest when managing their portfolio.\n\nThe key to effective portfolio management is thelong-term mix of assets. Generally, that means stocks, bonds, and cash equivalents such as certificates of deposit. There are others, called alternative investments, such as real estate, commodities, derivatives, and cryptocurrency.\n\nAsset allocation is based on the understanding that different types of assets do not move in concert, and some are more volatile than others. A mix of assets provides balance and protects against risk.\n\nInvestors with a more aggressive profile weigh their portfolios more toward volatile investments such as growth stocks. Investors with a conservative profile weigh their portfolios toward stabler investments such as bonds andblue chip stocks.\n\nRebalancing captures recent gains and opens new prospects while keeping the portfolio in line with its original risk-return profile.\n\nThe only certainty in investing is that it is impossible to consistently predict winners and losers. The prudent approach is to create a basket of investments that provides broad exposure across different assets.\n\nDiversification involves spreading therisk and rewardof individual securities within an asset class or between asset classes. Because it is difficult to know which subset of an asset class or sector is likely to outperform another, diversification seeks to capture the returns of different sectors over time while reducing volatility.\n\nReal diversification is made across various classes of securities, sectors of the economy, and geographical regions.\n\nRebalancing returns a portfolio to its original target allocation at regular intervals, usually annually. It reinstates the original asset mix when market movements push it out of kilter.\n\nFor example, a portfolio that starts with a 70% equity and 30% fixed-income allocation could, after an extended market rally, shift to an 80/20 allocation. Investors have made a good profit, but the portfolio now has more risk than investors with that balance can tolerate.\n\nRebalancing generally involves selling high-priced securities and investing the money in lower-priced and out-of-favor securities. This annual exercise allows investors to capture gains and expand their chances for growth in high-potential sectors while keeping the portfolio aligned with the original risk-return profile.\n\nA potentially material aspect of portfolio management relates to how your portfolio is shaped to minimize taxes over the long term. This is relevant for retirement accounts, as well as how long you plan to hold certain assets and which ones you choose.\n\nFor example, certain bonds may be tax-exempt. This means that any interest earned is not subject to taxes. Meanwhile, the IRS has different tax rules for short-term and long-term capital gains. For single filers and married couples filing separately earning less than $48,350 in 2025, their capital gains rate may be $0. Meanwhile, a long-termcapital gains taxof 15% applies if your income is above this threshold but below $533,400 for single filers. For incomes above $533,400 (single filers) or $600,050 (married filing jointly), the rate increases to 20%.\n\nPortfolios include investments across cash accounts, 401(k)s, IRAs, and other retirement accounts.\n\nEvery investor's specific situation is unique. Therefore, while some investors may be risk-averse, others may be inclined to pursue the greatest returns (while also incurring the greatest risk). Very broadly speaking, here are several common portfolio management strategies an investor can consider:\n\nWhen building and managing investment portfolios, it's crucial to understand the regulatory environment that governs financial advice. One significant aspect of this landscape is the Department of Labor's April 2024 fiduciary rule, known as theRetirement Security Rule, which has been undergoing legal challenges since its introduction.\n\nThe Retirement Security Rule was finalized in April 2024 and originally scheduled to take effect on Sept. 23, 2024. However, in July 2024, two Federal District Courts in Texas issued orders blocking implementation, ruling that industry trade groups would likely prevail in their argument that the DOL exceeded its authority. The Department of Justice filed an appeal to the Fifth Circuit, but following the change in presidential administrations in January 2025, the DOL filed a motion to pause the litigation, effectively putting the rule's future in doubt.\n\nAs such, the financial services industry remains subject to the previous five-part test from a 1975 DOL regulation. Under this standard, professionals are considered fiduciaries when providing investment advice if they meet all of the following criteria:\n\nThis standard has been criticized for being too narrow, potentially allowing some financial professionals to avoid fiduciary responsibility even when providing important investment recommendations.\n\nThese developments underscore the importance of individual investors understanding the nature of their relationship with financial advisors. It's crucial to know whether your advisor is acting as a fiduciary and what standards of care they are required to meet when providing investment advice, particularly for retirement accounts.\n\nWhatever strategy is chosen, portfolio management always faces several hurdles that often can't be eliminated entirely. Even if an investor has a foolproof portfolio management strategy, investment portfolios are subject tomarket fluctuationsand volatility. The best management approach can still suffer from significant losses.\n\nThough diversification is an important aspect of portfolio management, it can also be challenging to achieve. Finding the right mix of asset classes and investments to balance risk and return requires an in-depth understanding of the market and the investor's risk tolerance. Buying a wide range of securities may also be expensive to meet the desired diversification.\n\nTo devise the best portfolio management strategy, an investor must first know their risk tolerance,investment horizon, and return expectations. This requires a clear short-term and long-term goal. Because life circumstances can quickly and rapidly change, investors must be mindful of how some strategies limit liquidity or flexibility. In addition, the IRS may change tax regulations, forcing you to change your investment strategy.\n\nLastly, portfolio managers charge fees. The portfolio manager must often meet specific regulatory reporting requirements, and managers may not have the same views of the market as you do.\n\nThis is influenced by your financial goals, investment time horizon, income, and personal comfort with risk. Tools likerisk tolerance questionnairescan help quantify your risk tolerance by asking about your reactions to hypothetical market scenarios and your investment preferences. In addition, thinking back to your past investment experiences and consulting with a financial advisor can provide a clearer understanding of the kinds of investments that are right for you in terms of your risk tolerance.\n\nAsset allocation involves spreading the investor's money among different asset classes so that risks are reduced and opportunities for profit are maximized. Stocks, bonds, and cash are the three most common asset classes, but others include real estate, commodities, currencies, and crypto. Within each of these are subclasses that play into aportfolio allocation.\n\nIf this happens, it's important to avoidpanic sellingand instead assess the situation calmly. Start by reviewing your investment strategy to ensure it still aligns with your long-term goals and risk tolerance. Consider whether the losses are because of market volatility or fundamental changes in the assets you hold. Rebalancing your portfolio might be necessary to maintain your desired asset allocation. Diversifying your investments can also help mitigate future risks. Consulting with a financial advisor can give you guidance and help you make informed decisions about how to recover from your losses and adjust your strategy if needed.\n\nEvaluating the performance of your portfolio involves comparing its returns against benchmarks (typically indexes that offer a mix like you're aiming for in your portfolio) and considering your investment goals. Data to review includetotal return, your risk-adjusted return, and the performance of individual assets relative to their respective indexes. It's also important to review the consistency of your returns over time and whether your portfolio is making progress toward your objectives.\n\nAnyone who wants to grow their money has choices to make. You can be your own investment portfolio manager, or you can hire a professional to do it for you. You can choose apassive management strategyby putting your money in index funds. You can also try to beat the markets by actively managing your portfolio.\n\nYou'll want to pay attention to the basics of portfolio management: pick a mix of assets to lower your overall risk, diversify your holdings to maximize your potential returns, and rebalance your portfolio regularly to keep the mix right.\n\nS.K.
