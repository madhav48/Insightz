In addition to constructing new production facilities, these projects can also include building new distribution centers, offices, and housing for employees. The parent company chooses to create new operations in the foreign country rather than buying or partnering with an existing business there.\n\nThe term \"greenfield investment\" gets its name from a company\u2014usually amultinational corporation(MNC)\u2014launching a venture from the ground up, plowing and prepping a green field. These projects are foreign direct investments\u2014known simply as direct investments\u2014that provide the highest degree of control for the sponsoring company.\n\nAnother method of FDI includesforeign acquisitionsor buying a controlling stake in a foreign company.\u00a0However, when a business takes the acquisition route, it may face regulations or difficulties that can hinder the process.\n\nGreenfield investments carry the same high risks and costs associated with building new factories or manufacturing plants.\n\nIn a greenfield project, a company\u2019s plant construction, for example,\u00a0is done to its specifications, employees are trained to company standards, and fabrication processes can be tightly controlled.\n\nThis type of involvement is the opposite of indirect investment, such as the purchase of foreign securities. If companies use indirect investment, they may have little or no control over operations, quality control, sales, and training.\n\nSplitting the distance between a greenfield project and an indirect investment is abrown-field investment. With brown-field investing, a corporation leases existing facilities and land and adapts them to suit its needs. Renovation and customization usually result in relatively lower expenses and a quicker turn-around than building from scratch.\n\nDeveloping countries tend to attract prospective companies with offers of tax breaks, subsidies, or other incentives to set up a greenfield investment. While these concessions may result in lower corporate tax revenues for the foreign community in the short run, theeconomic benefitsand the enhancement of local human capital can deliver positive returns for the host nation over the long term.\n\nGreenfield investments have greatly benefited developing economies. For example, between 2003 and 2020, Bangladesh received $34.9 billion in greenfield FDI, which led to new businesses in key sectors like manufacturing, textiles, and power.In Ghana, hundreds of multinational companies launched 500 greenfield projects, which boosted job creation in sectors like consumer products, food and beverages, industrial equipment, and non-automotive transport. For every $1 million invested, 0.445 jobs were created.\n\nAs with any startup, greenfield investments entail higher risks and costs for building new factories or manufacturing plants. Setting up operations from scratch in a new country also requires navigating unfamiliar foreign environments, which can lead to uncertainty. Companies face political, economic, and market risks.\n\nTax breaks, financial incentives\n\nEverything done to specifications\n\nAs a long-term commitment, one of the greatest risks in greenfield investments is the relationship with the host country\u2014especially a politically unstable one. Any circumstances or events that result in the company needing to pull out of a project at any time can be financially devastating for the business.\n\nGreenfield investments can be measured in billions of dollars. For example, total planned expenditures for investments in the U.S. initiated in 2023 exceeded $148 billion, including first-year and future expenditures. The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) tracks greenfield investments involving foreign entities establishing new businesses in the U.S. or expanding existing foreign-owned businesses.\n\nAccording to the BEA, the Southeast U.S. continues to attract the highest levels of greenfield investment, driven by its favorable business environment and infrastructure. Florida, in particular, stands out as a leading state for FDI-related investment in the U.S., supporting over 417,000 jobs and nearly $100 billion in foreign-owned property, plant, and equipment. Companies from Europe, Canada, and Asia boost Florida\u2019s economy, creating jobs in key sectors such as manufacturing, real estate, and retail.\n\nHistorically, Mexico has been viewed as an attractive country for greenfield investments due in large part to its low labor and manufacturing costs and proximity to markets in the United States. Private sector investment in Mexico reached $38.2 billion from January to May 2024, according to the economy ministry. This marks a 35% increase from the same period in 2023 when investment totaled $29 billion. The biggest investment came from Evergo, an electric vehicle charger manufacturer based in the Dominican Republic, which is investing $200 million to install 15,000 charging stations throughout Mexico.\n\nThe name comes from the fact that these developments are taking place in previously undeveloped areas, such as green fields. This can be true both literally and figuratively. The development might literally take place in a previously green field. Figuratively, it might be taking place in an area with no other such developments.\n\nBrown-field investments involve redeveloping areas where industry already has existed. In some cases, it might involve redeveloping a previously developed property that has gone unused for some time.\n\nAs a new development, a greenfield project brings jobs to the nation where the development is taking place. This benefits the local economy directly and also benefits the local population, which gains income from the jobs as well as professional experience.\n\nGreenfield investments involve companies building new facilities from the ground up in other nations. The companies benefit because they often get tax breaks for developing in those nations. Those nations benefit from the new jobs that will boost their economies. These investments differ from brown-field investments, which involve companies building on land that has already been developed or used for industry.\n\nAli Raza et al. \"Is Greenfield Investment Improving Welfare: A Quantitative Analysis for Latin American and Caribbean Developing Countries.\"Heliyon. 2023 Oct; 9(10): e20703.\n\nAi-Jun, Guo, et al. \"Relationship Between Greenfield Investment and Economic Growth: Evidence from Bangladesh.\"Heliyon,vol. 9, no. 7,\u00a0July 2023, e17547.\n\nAssamah, Daniel, and\u00a0Shaoyu Yuan. \"Greenfield Investment and Job Creation in Ghana: A Sectorial Analysis and Geopolitical Implications of Chinese Investments.\"Humanities and Social Sciences Communications,vol. 11, 2024, Article number 487.\n\nOzbek, Orhan V, \"Effects of International Experience and Legitimacy on the Performance of Greenfield Investments\".School of Business: Faculty Scholarship, 2018.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \"New Foreign Direct Investment in the United States, 2023.\"\n\nSelect Florida. \"Foreign Direct Investment in Florida.\"\n\nFreightWaves. \"Borderlands Mexico: Private Sector Investment in Mexico $39B So Far in 2024.\"",
