  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nSocial science is the study of how people interact with one another. The branches of social science include anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology.\n\nSocial scientists study how societies work, exploring everything from the triggers of economic growth and the causes of unemployment to what makes people happy. Their findings inform public policies, education programs, urban design, marketing strategies, and many other endeavors.\n\nSocial science as a field of study is separate from the natural sciences, which covers topics such as physics, biology, and chemistry.\n\nSocial science examines the relationships between individuals and societies as well as the development and operation of societies, rather than focusing on the physical world. The academic disciplines involved in the social sciences rely more heavily on interpretation andqualitativeresearch methodologies than do the natural sciences.\n\nThere are many fields within social science. The five main ones are anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology, although some people also include history, criminology, and geography.\n\nOpinions vary on which branches of study are included under social science. However, most observers agree that the following five fields fall into the category:\n\nHistory is also sometimes regarded as a branch of social science, although many historians often consider the subject to share closer links to the humanities. Both humanities and social science study human beings. What separates them is the technique applied: Humanities are viewed as more philosophical and less scientific.Law, too, has some ties to social science, as does geography.\n\nAnthropology, the study of the origin and\u00a0development\u00a0of human societies and\u00a0cultures, has been a focal point for centuries. The field gained importance in Europe's\u00a0Age of Enlightenment, which flourished in the 17th and 18th centuries. During that period, there was a pronounced focus on advancing society and knowledge, and understanding human behavior was seen as a key to achieving that goal.\n\nThe history of economic thought goes back all the way to ancient Greek philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Xenophon. Their works laid the foundation of nearly all social science, economics included.\n\nAs travel became easier in the 15th to 18th centuries, and more nations were able to partake in international trade, the economic system ofmercantilismgrew. The economic actions of many nations were suddenly motivated by the belief that a country should maximize exports and minimize imports.\n\nThis predominating school of thought was challenged by writers such asAdam Smith, commonly known as the father of modern economics. Smith\u2019s ideas, along with those of Rousseau andJohn Locke, promoted the idea of a self-regulating economy and introduced the concept of what is known asclassical economics. Smith\u2019s bookThe Wealth of Nationsis still studied today and admired by many politicians.\n\nTwo other important economists who have shaped the way we think of economics areKarl MarxandJohn Maynard Keynes. Marx famously challenged capitalism as an appropriate economic model by placing an emphasis on thelabor theory of value. While Marx\u2019s ideas are by no means widely endorsed by most of today\u2019s politicians, his critique of capitalism has had a huge impact on many thinkers.\n\nTheKeynesian school of economics, meanwhile, is very popular among today\u2019s economists. Keynesian economics is considered ademand-sidemacroeconomic theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run. It was the first to separate the study of economic behavior and markets based on individual incentives from the study of broad national economic aggregate variables and constructs.\n\nThe origins of political science can be traced back to ancient Greece. Back then, the philosopher Plato wrote various dialogues about politics, justice, and what constitutes good government.\n\nPlato\u2019s early contributions would gradually take on a more scientific approach, led by thinkers including Aristotle, Thomas Hobbes, Marx, and Max Weber. Centuries of research into politics helped to boost democracy and assist politicians in making popular policy choices and get voted into power.\n\nPsychology is one of the fastest growing fields of social science. It began as a medical field of study in the late 1800s and grew popular in the Western world throughout the 20th century, thanks in part to the work of Sigmund Freud.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 20.3% of adults had received some form of mental health treatment in 2020.Although many still use psychiatric medicine to treat their mental health issues, more people in recent years are seeking alternative treatments, such as mindfulness training and yoga in addition to traditional talk therapy.\n\nNeuroscience, drug treatments, and a growing variety of approaches to psychotherapy are adding to the options for psychological treatment. Research on animal learning, social psychology, and economic psychology are other branches of the field.\n\nSociology as a science developed in Europe in the mid-1800s, a period of rapid social change. Political revolutions and theIndustrial Revolutiondrastically altered how many people lived, which wasn't always for the better. This prompted early sociologists to wonder how to maintain stability when so much in life was shifting so fast.\n\nThe first sociology course in the U.S. was taught at Yale University by 1875. In the years that followed, other colleges added sociology to the curriculum and the subject arrived in high schools in 1911.\n\nIn the United States, education in the social sciences begins in elementary school and progresses throughout middle and high school. There is an emphasis on aspects of core social sciences such as economics and political science. At the collegiate level, more specialized disciplines are offered.\n\nNowadays, colleges and universities offer numerous social science programs. For example, the University of California, Berkeley has 15 academic departments categorized as social sciences. They are:\n\nMaster\u2019s degree\u00a0and Ph.D. programs at colleges and universities\u00a0offer opportunities for deeper specialization.\n\nEconomists and social workers are among the most sought-after employees in the U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\n\nTypical careers in social science include working as an advertiser, psychologist, teacher, lawyer, manager, social worker, andeconomist.\n\nThe subject matter of social science\u2014human behavior, relationships, attitudes, and how these things have changed over time\u2014is useful information for any successful business to possess. The concepts of social science, such as demography, political science, and sociology, are frequently applied in many different business contexts.\n\nFor example, advertising and marketing professionals often use theories of human behavior from these fields to more efficiently market their products to consumers.\n\nNaturally, the field of economics is key to the business sector. Many industries use economic analysis and quantitative methods to study and forecast business, sales, and other market trends.\n\nIn fact, economists are some of the most sought-after workers in the U.S., especiallybehavioral economists, who use psychology to analyze and predict the economic decision-making processes of individuals and institutions.\n\nAccording to the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the projected change in employment for economists from 2022 to 2032 is 6%, about the same as the average 3% projection for all occupations.Social workers, too, are expected to see a similar level of demand, with the BLS predicting employment in this particular field to grow by 7% from 2022 to 2032.\n\nThe BLS also reports that those with a social science degree generally command higher salaries than their peers with other types of degrees but it can depend heavily on the field of employment they enter into.\n\nAccording to BLS research, the median wage for a social worker was $58,380 in May 2023 while the median pay for an economist was $115,730 at that time.\n\nThe origins of social science can be traced back to the ancient Greeks.The lives they led, as well as their early studies of human nature, the state, and mortality, helped to shape Western civilization.\n\nSocial science as an academic field of study developed out of the aforementioned Age of Enlightenment (or Age of Reason). Smith, Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Denis Diderot, Immanuel Kant, and David Hume were among the major intellectuals at the time who laid the foundation for the study of social science in the Western world.\n\nIndividuals began to take a more disciplined approach to quantifying their observations of society. Over time, similar aspects of society, such as linguistics and psychology, were separated into unique fields of study.\n\nThe social sciences are important because they help people understand how to analyze not only their own behavior but also the behavior and motivations of their peers. The social sciences also give us a better understanding of how to create more inclusive and effective societal institutions.\n\nTypically, the path to obtaining a career in the social sciences begins by getting a four-year university degree in one of the social science subjects. If you\u2019re interested in pursuing a career in social work or psychology, these careers often require additional schooling, certificates, and licenses.\n\nA degree in the social sciences can help land you a job as an economist, psychologist, or survey researcher, as well as open up opportunities in sectors such as law, government, politics, and academia.\n\nSocial science helps us to gain knowledge of ourselves, our peers, and the society in which we live. Human behavior is important, and having a decent grasp of it should, in theory, lead to greater efficiencies and quality of life for everyone.\n\nUniversity of South Florida, Digital Commons. \u201cSocial Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices,\u201d Pages 10-11.\n\nUniversity of South Florida, Digital Commons. \u201cSocial Science Research: Principles, Methods, and Practices,\u201d Page 14.\n\nThomas Hylland Eriksen and Finn Sivert Nielsen, via Google Books. \u201cA History of Anthropology,\u201d Pages 11\u201319.
