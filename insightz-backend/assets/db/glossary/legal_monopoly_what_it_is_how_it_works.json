  "term": "Legal Monopoly: What it is, How it Works",
  "definition": "A legal monopoly refers to a company that is operating as amonopolyunder a government mandate. A legal monopoly offers a specific product or service at a regulated price. It can either be independently run and government regulated, or both government-run and government regulated. A legal monopoly is also\u00a0known as a \"statutory monopoly.\"\n\nA legal monopoly is initially ordered because it is perceived as the best option for both a government and its citizens. For example, in the U.S., AT&T operated as a legal monopoly until 1982 because it was deemed vital to have cheap and reliable service that was readily available to everyone. Railroads and airlines have also been operated as legal monopolies, throughout different periods in history.\n\nA legal monopoly materially differs from a \"de facto\" monopoly, which refers to a monopoly that is not created by a government entity.\n\nThe prevailing idea behind instituting legal monopolies is\u00a0that if too many competitors invest in their own deliveryinfrastructure, prices across the board, in a given industry, would climb to unreasonably high levels. While this idea has merit, it does not sustain itself indefinitely, because in most cases,capitalismeventually wins\u00a0out over legal monopolies. As technologies advances and economies evolve, playing fields typically level out, all on their own. Consequently, costs drop and barriers to entry diminish. In other words: competition ultimately benefits consumers, more-so than legal monopolies do.\n\nThroughout history, various governments have\u00a0imposed legal monopolies on\u00a0a variety ofcommodities, including salt, iron, and\u00a0tobacco. The very earliest iteration of a legal monopoly is the\u00a0Statute of Monopolies\u00a0of 1623, an act by England's Parliament. Under this statute, patents evolved fromletters patent, which is written orders issued by a monarch, granting title to an individual or a corporation.\n\nThe\u00a0Dutch East India Company,\u00a0British East India Company, and similar national trading companies were granted exclusive trade rights by their respective national governments. Private freelance traders operating outside the scope of those two companies\u00a0were subject to criminal penalties. Consequently, those\u00a0companies fought wars in the 17th century, in an effort to define and defend their monopoly territories.\n\nLegal monopolies on\u00a0alcohol\u00a0remain fairly common, both as a source of public revenue and as a means of control. Meanwhile,\u00a0monopolies on\u00a0opium\u00a0and\u00a0cocaine\u2014once important revenue sources\u2014were converted or re-instituted during the twentieth century, to curb the abuse of\u00a0controlled substances. For example,\u00a0Mallinckrodt Incorporated\u00a0is the only legal supplier of cocaine in the\u00a0United States.\n\nThe regulation of\u00a0gambling\u00a0in many places includes a legal\u00a0monopoly, with\u00a0respect to national\u00a0or\u00a0state lotteries.\u00a0Where private operations are allowed with businesses like horse racing tracks,\u00a0off-track betting venues, and\u00a0casinos, the authorities may license only one operator.",
