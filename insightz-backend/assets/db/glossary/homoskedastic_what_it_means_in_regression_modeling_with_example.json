  "definition": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups.\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nHomoskedastic (also spelled \"homoscedastic\") refers to a condition in which the variance of the residual, orerror term, in a regression model is constant. That is, the error term does not vary much as the value of the predictor variable changes. Another way of saying this is that the variance of the data points is roughly the same for all data points.\n\nThis suggests a level of consistency and makes it easier to model and work with the data through regression. A lack of homoskedasticity may suggest that the regression model may need to include additional predictor variables to explain the performance of the dependent variable.\n\nHomoskedasticity is one assumption oflinear regressionmodeling, and data of this type work well with theleast squares method. If the variance of the errors around the regression line varies much, the regression model may be poorly defined.\n\nThe opposite of homoskedasticity is heteroskedasticity (just as the opposite of \"homogenous\" is \"heterogeneous\").Heteroskedasticity(also spelled \u201cheteroscedasticity\u201d) refers to a condition in which the variance of the error term in a regression equation is not constant.\n\nA simple regression model, or equation, consists of four terms. On the left side is the dependent variable. It represents the phenomenon the model seeks to \"explain.\" On the right side are a constant, a predictor variable, and a residual term, also known as an error term. The error term shows the amount of variability in the dependent variable that is not explained by the predictor variable.\n\nSuppose you wanted to explain student test scores using the amount of time each student spent studying. In this case, the test scores would be the dependent variable and the time spent studying would be the predictor variable.\n\nThe error term would show the amount of variance in the test scores that was not explained by the amount of time studying. If thatvarianceis uniform, or homoskedastic, then that would suggest the model may be an adequate explanation for test performance\u2014that is, that the amount of time spent studying explains the test scores.\n\nBut the variance may be heteroskedastic. A plot of the error term data may show a large amount of study time corresponded very closely with high test scores but that low study time test scores varied widely and even included some very high scores.\n\nThis would indicate that the variance of scores was not well-explained simply by the one predictor variable of the amount of time studying. In this case, some other factor is probably at work. The model would likely need to be enhanced to identify it or them.\n\nWhen considering that variance is the measured difference between the predicted outcome and the actual outcome of a given situation, determining homoskedasticity can help to determine which factors need to be adjusted for accuracy.\n\nFurther investigation may reveal other factors that impacted scores, such as:\n\nTo improve on the regression model, the researcher would have to try out other explanatory variables that could provide a more accurate fit to the data. If, for example, some students had seen the answers ahead of time, theregression modelwould then have two explanatory variables: time studying and whether the student had prior knowledge of the answers.\n\nWith these two variables, more of the variance of the test scores would be explained and the variance of the error term might then be homoskedastic, suggesting that the model was well-defined.\n\nHeteroskedasticity in statistics is the error variance. This is the dependence of scattering that occurs within a sample with a minimum of one independent variable. This means that the standard deviation of a predictable variable is non-constant.\n\nYou can tell if a regression is homoskedastic by looking at the ratio between the largest variance and the smallest variance. If the ratio is 1.5 or smaller, then the regression is homoskedastic.\n\nHomoskedasticity is important because it identifies dissimilarities in a population. Any variance in a population or sample that is not even will produce results that are skewed or biased, making the analysis incorrect or worthless.\n\nIn a linear regression model, homoskedasticity occurs when the variance of the error term is constant.\u00a0This indicates that the model is well-defined, meaning that the dependent variable is adequately defined by the predictor variable.\n\nIf there is too much variance in the error term, the model isn't well-defined. This is known as heteroskedasticity. Too much variance indicates that there are other factors influencing the dependent variable. These factors need to be considered through further investigation or modeling.",
