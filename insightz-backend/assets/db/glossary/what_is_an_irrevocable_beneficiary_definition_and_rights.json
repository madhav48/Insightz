  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn irrevocable beneficiary is a person or entity designated to receive the assets in alife insurancepolicy or asegregated fundcontract. What is irrevocable is the beneficiary status. You can\u2019t choose on your own to change the beneficiary or the terms of the policy, and you can\u2019t cancel the policy without the beneficiary\u2019s consent. The beneficiary must agree to any and all changes in the rights to compensation from these entities.\n\nAn irrevocable beneficiary has certain guaranteed rights to assets held in the policy or fund. It\u2019s a more ironclad status than that of arevocable\u00a0beneficiary, whose right to assets can be denied or amended under certain circumstances.\n\nWith a life insurance policy, the policyholder may designate either an irrevocable or revocable beneficiary to receive a payout in the event of the insured\u2019s death. If someone is listed as an irrevocable beneficiary, then denial of income from the policy after the death of the insured is not possible, nor are any changes made to policy payout terms\u2014unless the beneficiary agrees to them.\n\nFor example, a spouse who is an irrevocable beneficiary has the right to a policy payout even after a divorce. The ex-spouse must agree to changes in the policy before or after the death of the insured. Even the insured cannot\u00a0change the status of an irrevocable beneficiary once they are named. Irrevocable beneficiaries also have to be notified if either the policy lapses or an attempt is made to cancel it.\n\nIn some states, an irrevocable beneficiary has the right to veto any changes to an insurance policy, including cancellation. In other states, they may only challenge items that directly affect them, such as a payout.\n\nThe main advantage to naming an irrevocable beneficiary is that it ensures that money goes where you want it to go. Difficult to change during your life and virtually impossible to alter after your death, it\u2019s for the bequests that you\u2019re 100% sure of and don\u2019t want to have to worry about keeping up to date.\n\nChildren are often named irrevocable beneficiaries.\u00a0If a parent wanted to guarantee money to a child, then the parent could designate that child as an irrevocable beneficiary, thus ensuring the child will receivedeath benefitsfrom the life insurance policy or segregated fund\u00a0contract. A parent might also make their spouse an irrevocable beneficiary to ensure that they have the means to support their offspring properly and not be dependent on someone else.\n\nAs a way to safeguard an inheritance, making a beneficiary irrevocable can be especially important in this era of multiple marriages and blended families. A stepparent can\u2019t cut off a child from a previous marriage or alter or challenge a policy after the death of the insured. In case of a messy divorce, naming a child rather than a spouse as the policy\u2019s irrevocable beneficiary could be preferable.\n\nA beneficiary designation means that the funds in question don\u2019t have to go through probate, so the recipient gets them faster.\n\nBeneficiaries can protect assets in other ways. A beneficiary designation overrides any sort of bequest made in a will, and it doesn\u2019t have to go through probate. The recipient will get funds faster this way.\n\nIrrevocable beneficiaries can also play a role in estate planning. If you name a beneficiary on a life insurance policy and then put that policy in anirrevocable life insurance trust\u00a0(ILIT), the proceeds are then considered removed from your estate\u2014thus avoiding potential estate andgift taxesafter your death.An appointed trustee can supervise the\u00a0trust\u00a0and distribute the assets, which can be helpful in the case of irresponsible beneficiaries or when the beneficiary is a minor.\n\nAlthough irrevocable beneficiaries are pretty well-shielded to begin with, irrevocable trusts offer an additionallayer of protection against legal challenges. A beneficiary can\u2019t be sued by a creditor for these funds because the money is owned by the trust, not the individual, while the beneficiary doesn\u2019t own the money until the payout.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of having an irrevocable beneficiary is inflexibility. You can\u2019t make any changes without the beneficiary\u2019s consent. Life has a way of surprising us, so you need to be very sure that circumstances won\u2019t make you regret your choice.\n\nAs to irrevocable trusts, an additional disadvantage is that you lose control of the assets in the trust, ceding that control to a trustee. If you suddenly need to access the funds due to an emergency, you don\u2019t have it.\n\nA policyholder can be ordered by a court to designate their ex-spouse as a designated beneficiary. Most often, this is seen in cases where there are dependent children, child support, or alimony involved.\n\nIn such a case, the ex-spouse can work with a divorce lawyer to persuade a court to make the policyholder designate the ex-spouse as an irrevocable beneficiary to secure child support. However, the court can also have the policy amended if it\u2019s deemed that the payout is excessive in regard to what is needed to support the child or at a time when the children are no longer seen as\u00a0dependents.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note, however, that state law ultimately decides the rights of beneficiaries to an insurance policy, whether they are revocable or irrevocable beneficiaries.\u00a0Policyholders should be clear with any beneficiary as to what theterms and conditions of a life insurance policywill be.\n\nSome financial planners, including insurance companies themselves, recommend that you review your beneficiaries annually. That might be unnecessary, especially if you have named irrevocable beneficiaries. However, whenever a major life change occurs\u2014marriage, divorce, the birth of a child, or death\u2014you definitely should look over your beneficiaries.\n\nIrrevocable beneficiaries will always beprimary beneficiaries. They take priority over revocable beneficiaries, forcing those others intosecondaryor tertiary status. It would be extremely rare for an irrevocable beneficiary to take second place.\n\nYou can\u2019t without difficulty. The point of irrevocable beneficiary status is its permanency. Generally speaking, an irrevocable beneficiary can only be removed if the beneficiary agrees to be displaced, voluntarily surrendering their status.\n\nABA Section of Taxation NewsQuarterly. \u201cIrrevocable Life Insurance Trusts: An Effective Estate Tax Reduction Technique,\u201d Page 1.",
