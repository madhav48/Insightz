  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nTax season is the period between Jan. 1 and about April 15 of each year when taxpayers get ready to report their taxable income for the previous year.\n\nTax season is the period of time, generally between Jan. 1 and about April 15 of each year, when taxpayers prepare to report their taxable income to the federal government and, in most cases, to the government of the state where they live.\n\nTax day in the U.S. is usually April 15. If that date falls on a weekend, the deadline is delayed until the following Monday.The deadline has sometimes been extended for some or all filers. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) keepsa list of delayed deadlines due to natural disasterson its website.\n\nTax returns submitted after the deadline are subject to late penalty fees and interest charges.Extensions are available but they delay only the filing of the paperwork, not the payment of any taxes owed.\n\nThe current tax season began on Jan. 1, 2025, with a filing deadline of Tuesday, April 15, 2025.\n\nNobody expects you to spend three and a half months working on your taxes. Tax season is meant to provide time for employers, banks, financial services providers, and other entities to collate and distribute all of the information taxpayers need to file their returns.\n\nThe deadline for employers to sendW-2sto their employees is Jan. 31.Businesses that hireindependent contractorsmust send these \"nonemployees\"Form\u00a01099-NEC. This form replaced1099-MISC, which remains in effect for income received from rent and prizes, among other sources.\n\nIndependent contractors must file a return and payself-employment taxeson any net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.\n\nThe IRS advises that all taxpayers keep copies of their tax returns for at least three years. In the event of an IRS audit, a taxpayer will be required to present the last three years of their documents. In extreme cases, such as suspicion of fraud, they will be expected to show seven years of documents.\n\nMany taxpayers wait to file until just before the deadline, but there is no need to put it off until the last minute. Indeed, filing an early tax return can make sense for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe best reason is that manytaxpayersget money back from the government.If you file early, you'll get your money back early. Wait until the last minute and your return will wait for processing in a very large pile of returns.\n\nThe IRS began accepting and processing 2024 tax year returns on Jan. 27, 2025. Even if you don't file early, there are reasons to begin preparation as soon as you can.\n\nStarting your filing process early gives you the time you need to collect the evidence needed to claim all of your deductions. You will avoid the headache of the middle of the night stress over figures and receipts. Your accountant will have a more flexible schedule and will probably be able to start working on your accounts immediately. Also, by filing early, you will short-circuit would-be identity thieves.\n\nThe IRS began accepting 2024 returns on Jan. 27, 2025.\n\nIf you plan to file directly, you might consider creating an account atIRS.gov/account, where you'll find useful information about filing.\n\nThe IRS says that almost all single and married taxpayers, regardless of income, can now file their federal tax returns electronically free of charge using the IRS.gov website or the IRS2Go app.\n\nThrough an agreement with the IRS, taxpayers with income below certain levels can use any of a number of tax return software programs.\n\n(State taxes are a separate matter, and state rules apply.)\n\nThe IRS states that most tax refunds are distributed within 21 calendar days of filing. You'll get your refund fastest if you file early.\n\nTax season is the period when individuals, couples, and some businesses prepare their documents for filing taxes, which are generally due on or about April 15 of each year. Most people and businesses start receiving the needed documents to fill out their tax forms in January. Therefore, tax season is usually considered to be between Jan. 1 and April 15.\n\nDuring this time, taxpayers gather together their paperwork and complete their tax forms, with the use of tax preparation software or directly through IRS.gov. Whichever method you choose, it's important to get the paperwork in by the deadline (along with the money due, if any) to avoid penalties and interest charges.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"When to File.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Failure to File Penalty.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 752, Filing Forms W-2 and W-3.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"General Instructions for Certain Information Returns, (Forms 1096, 1097, 1098, 1099, 3921, 3922, 5498, and W-2G).\" Page 27.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 554, Self-Employment Tax.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 305, Recordkeeping.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Season Rapidly Approaching: Get Ready Now to File 2023 Federal Income Tax Returns in Early 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Free File: Do your Taxes for Free.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Season Refund Frequently Asked Questions.\"",
