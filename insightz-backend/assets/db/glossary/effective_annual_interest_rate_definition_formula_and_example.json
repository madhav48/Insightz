  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate is the compounded interest rate paid on an investment or the real rate of interest paid on a debt.\n\nThe\u00a0effective annual interest rate is the actual return on a savings account or other interest-bearing investment when the effects of compounding are considered. It also is the real percentage rate paid in interest on a loan or other debt.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate is sometimes called the effective rate or the annual equivalent rate (AER).\n\nThe effective annual interest rate describes the actual interest rate that's associated with a financial product or loan. The most important aspect of effective annual interest rates is that they account for the fact that more frequent compounding periods will lead to a higher effectiveinterest rate.\n\nSuppose you have two loans, each with an interest rate of 10%. One compounds annually and the other compounds twice yearly. They both have a stated interest rate of 10% but the effective annual interest rate on the loan that compounds twice a year will be higher.\n\nThis bar chart shows how different compound periods make a difference over 10 years with 10% on an initial $1,000.00.\n\nThe following formula is used to calculate the effective annual interest rate:\n\nEffectiveAnnualInterestRate=(1+in)n\u22121where:i=Nominal\u00a0interest\u00a0raten=Number\u00a0of\u00a0periods\\begin{aligned} &Effective\\ Annual\\ Interest\\ Rate=\\left ( 1+\\frac{i}{n} \\right )^n-1\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &i=\\text{Nominal interest rate}\\\\ &n=\\text{Number of periods}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bEffectiveAnnualInterestRate=(1+ni\u200b)n\u22121where:i=Nominal\u00a0interest\u00a0raten=Number\u00a0of\u00a0periods\u200b\n\nConsider these two offers: Investment A pays 10% interest, compounded monthly. Investment B pays 10.1%,\u00a0compounded semiannually. Which is the better offer?\n\nThe advertised interest rate is the nominal interest rate in both cases. The effective annual interest rate is calculated by adjusting the nominal interest rate for the number of compounding periods for the compounding product. That period is one year in this case. These are the formula and calculations:\n\nInvestment B has a higher stated nominal interest rate but the effective annual interest rate is lower than the effective rate for investment A because Investment B compounds fewer times over the year.\n\nLet's assume that you invest $5 million. The annual compounding result for Investment A is $523,500 in this example: $5 million \u00d7 10.47%.\n\nThe result for Investment B is $518,000: $5 million \u00d7 10.36%.\n\nThe wrong decision (choosing Investment B instead of Investment A) would effectively cost $5,500 ($523,500 minus $518,000) if an investor were to put $5 million into one of these investments.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate is important because borrowers might underestimate the true cost of a loan without it. Investors need it to project the actual expected return on an investment, such as acorporate bond.\n\nEAR is also crucial for borrowers because it reveals the actual cost of a loan by accounting for compounding periods. A higher EAR means more frequent compounding, leading to higher overall interest costs than the nominal rate suggests. This affects the total amount repayable.\n\nFocusing on the EAR rather than the nominal rate is essential for borrowers comparing loan offers. It ensures a more accurate comparison of loan costs, highlighting the impact of different compounding frequencies on the total interest paid over time. This ultimately aids in making more informed financial decisions.\n\nThe effective annual interest rate increases as the number ofcompounding periodsincreases. Quarterly compounding produces higher returns than semiannual compounding. Monthly compounding produces higher returns than quarterly and daily compounding produces higher returns than monthly.\n\nThis is a breakdown of the results of these different compound periods with a 10% nominal interest rate:\n\nThere's a ceiling to the effects of compounding. The limit of compounding is reached if compounding occurs an infinite number of times, not just every second or microsecond, but continuously.\n\nThecontinuously compoundedeffective annual interest rate is 10.517% with 10%. The continuous rate is calculated by raising the number \u201ce\u201d (about 2.71828) to the power of the interest rate and subtracting one. It would be 2.71828(0.1)\u2013 1 in this example.\n\nEAR is best for industries that want to boast higher rates. Nominal rates are best for industries that want to downplay costs. Pay attention to which is being used when you look at marketing materials.\n\nThe primary difference between an effective annual interest rate and a nominal interest rate is the compounding periods. The nominal interest rate is a stated interest rate that doesn't take the effects of compounding interest orinflationinto account. It's sometimes also referred to as the \"quoted\" or \"advertised\" interest rate for this reason.\n\nThe EAR accounts for the effects of compounding interest. It's the true annual interest rate after accounting for the impact of compounding interest which is typically higher than the nominal interest rate.\n\nThe EAR may be used rather than the nominal rate when communicating rates in an attempt to lure business. The effective annual interest rate will be higher than 5% if a bank offers a nominal interest rate of 5% per year on a savings account and compounds interest monthly. The bank might therefore consider promoting the account at the EAR because that rate will appear higher.\n\nAccounts for compounding periods\n\nTypically higher than the nominal rate\n\nEffective annual interest rates are used in several financial calculations and transactions.\n\nEAR is broadly used across the financial sector, but it has several downsides. The EAR calculation assumes that the interest rate will be constant throughout the entire period and that there are no fluctuations in rates. Interest rates can change frequently and rapidly, however, and this often impacts the overall rate of return. Most EAR calculations don't consider the impact of transaction, service, or account maintenance fees, either. These can also affect the total return.\n\nEAR calculations usually don't consider the impact of taxes on returns. Taxes can significantly reduce the actual returns on investments or savings, and it's important to factor them into any analysis. An individual may truly earn at the EAR, but their true return can be reduced by 20% or more based on theirtax bracket.\n\nEAR quotes are often unsuitable for short-term investments because there are fewer compounding periods. EAR is used for long-term investments more often because the impact of compounding can be significant. This approach may limit the vehicles in which EAR is calculated or communicated.\n\nThe EAR calculation is a single rate, so it doesn't calculate, communicate, or convey the risks of an investment or loan. Higher returns often come with higher risk, and it's important to consider the risk associated with an investment or loan before deciding.\n\nYou might seecertificates of deposit, savings accounts, or loan offers advertised with both their nominal interest rates and their effective annual interest rates. The nominal interest rate doesn't reflect the effects of compounding interest or the fees for these financial products, so it's unlikely to give you a fully accurate picture of how much you can potentially earn. Effective annual interest rates are real returns or interest payments.\n\nEffective annual interest rates are essential. They allow you to compare various offers accurately.\n\nThe discount yield is the annualized return on a discount bond, such as aTreasury bill. It's calculated as the difference between the face value and the purchase price divided by the face value and adjusted for the number of days to maturity.\n\nThis is the total return expected on abondif it's held until maturity. It accounts for all coupon payments received over the bond's life and any capital gain or loss.\n\nSavers or investors should have a higher EAR but it's worse for borrowers. The EAR will likely be higher than the nominal rate in either case, however. It may be more strategic to understand how the EAR has changed and what trends look like when you're evaluating future transactions.\n\nBanks and other financial institutions typically advertise theirmoney marketrates using the nominal interest rate which doesn't consider fees or compounding. The effective annual interest rate does take compounding into account and it results in a higher rate than the nominal. The more compounding periods there are, the higher the ultimate effective interest rate will be.\n\nConsumers should pay attention to the effective annual interest rate, not the headline-grabbing nominal interest rate when they're comparing interest rates on a deposit or loan.\n\nRober Parrino et al. \"Fundamentals of Corporate Finance.\" Sections 14-20,John Wiley & Sons, 2022.\n\nSunil Parameswaran. \"Fundamentals of Financial Instruments: An Introduction to Stocks, Bonds, Foreign Exchange, and Derivatives.\" Pages55\u201357 and 62.John Wiley & Sons, 2022.\n\nSunil Parameswaran. \"Fundamentals of Financial Instruments: An Introduction to Stocks, Bonds, Foreign Exchange, and Derivatives.\" Pages146\u2013153.John Wiley & Sons, 2022,",
