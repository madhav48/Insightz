  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nDeep in the money is an option that has an exercise or strike price significantly below (for acall option) or above (for aput option) the market price of the underlying asset. The value of such an option is nearly all intrinsic value and minimal extrinsic or time value. Deep in the money options have deltas at or close to 1.00 (or 100%), which means the price of the option is expected to increase or decrease nearly in unison with the change in market price of the underlying security.\n\nDeep in the money options can be contrasted with those deep out of the money, which instead have nointrinsic valueand also minimalextrinsicvalue. These options have deltas close to zero.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service(IRS) defines deep in the money options as either:\n\nAn option is usually said to be \"deep in the money\" if it isin the money(ITM) by more than $10. So, if a call\u00a0option is deep in the money, it means that the strike price\u00a0is at least $10 less than the underlying asset, or $10 higher for a put option. For\u00a0lower-priced\u00a0equities, $5 or less may be the level necessary to be deep in the money.\n\nThe most important characteristic of this type of option is its considerable intrinsic value. To calculate the value of a call option, one must subtract the strike price from the underlying asset'smarket price. For a put option, you would add the strike price to the underlying asset price.\n\nDeep in the money options have a very highdeltalevel, meaning that the options will move\u00a0nearly\u00a0in lock-step with the underlying asset.\n\nAs a call option moves deeper into the money, its delta will approach 100%. At this delta, every point change ofunderlying assetprice results in an equal, simultaneous option price change in the same direction.\n\nFor this reason, deep in the money options are an excellent strategy for long-term investors, especially compared toat the money(ATM) andout of the money(OTM) options. Investing in the option is similar to investing in the underlying asset, except the option holder will have the benefits of lower capital outlay, limited risk,leverage, and greater profit potential.\n\nDeep in the money options allow the investor to profit the same or nearly the same from a stock's movement as the holders (orshort sellers) of the actual stock, despite costing less to purchase than the underlying asset. While the deep money option carries\u00a0a lower capital outlay and risk; they are not without risk.\n\nBecause options have a limited lifespan, unlike stocks, the investor (the buyer of the option) needs the underlying stock to move in the desired direction (higher for calls and lower for puts) within the specified period to make a profit. There is always the possibility that the stock will move in the opposite of the desired direction, leading the option to lose value and even potentially fall OTM. In that case,intrinsic value declinesor completely disappears, leaving only\u00a0thepremium, which is at the mercy oftime decay.\n\nTraders will often look to close out deep in the money options byexercising them early, which is only allowed forAmerican options\u2014European options can only be exercised when they expire. Doing so can help clean up a trader's options position, while also capturing more favorable interest rates (in the case of deep puts) or dividends (in the case of deep calls).\n\nThis is because owning a deep put is effectively the same as being short the stock\u2014but without being credited the short proceeds that can earn interest. Likewise, beinglonga deep call is effectively the same as being long the stock, but contract holders would not receive thedividendspaid unless they owned the shares instead.\n\nSuppose an investor buys a May call option for stock ABC with a strike price of $175 on Jan 1, 2019. The closing price for ABC was $210 on Jan 1, 2019, and strike prices for May call options on the same day were: $150, $175, $210, $225, and $235.\n\nBecause the option term is more than 90 days, the call option with a strike price of $150 (two strikes less than $210) is a deep in the money option. At the same time, these options both probably have deltas somewhere in the high 0.90s.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
