  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nModus operandi is a Latin term used in English-speaking circles to describe an individual's or group's habitual way of operating, which forms a discernible pattern. The term is primarily used when discussingcriminal behavior, but it is not exclusively uttered in this context. Modus operandi can also be defined as a specific method of operation.\n\nFor example, military strategists refer to an enemy's modus operandi when predicting the next threatening move in an armed conflict. Synonymous with the term \"operating mode,\" modus operandi is routinely shortened to the initials \"M.O.,\" in both written and verbal usage.\n\nGroups of people or different societies often exhibit thought patterns or behavioral patterns that are specific to those cultures. These M.O.s may vary widely across cultural or geographic boundaries. Furthermore, M.O.s are fluid, in that they may change as values evolve or as demographic breakdowns shift within a particular society.\n\nIndividuals also often behave in the same way that they have done before, exhibiting similar patterns throughout their lifetime. Studying individuals and their decisions over time can lead one to predict an individual or business's next move.\n\nFor example,Warren Buffetthas stuck to a similarinvestingpattern his whole life, which he has made well known through speaking engagements, interviews, and books he has written. If one were to study all of this material and eventually understand Buffett's investing M.O., they would be able to guess his investing moves in certain economic conditions and perhaps apply the same strategies to their ownportfolios.\n\nM.O., however, is most often attributed to criminals and crime syndicates and used to stop crime. Investigators, the FBI, and police organizations can utilize patterns in preventing crime and apprehending those that have or seek to commit it.\n\nAn enemy's M.O. can be used by security experts to prevent an attack while it's still in the preparation stages. Known as \"predictive profiling,\" this behavior is an extension of an M.O. that was developed by Israeli security forces to anticipate the actions of resistance fighters, based on observing a group's or an individual's behavioral patterns. However, predictive profiling has been criticized as a technological facade for old-fashioned racial profiling.\n\nPredictive profiling is used for observing potential threats, examining situations or objects surrounding said threats, and developing an operational profile of the suspects to predict the next threat. If a person regularly meets with a known criminal element, at a certain house, at a particular time of day, the operational profile may predict the time and location of that person's next visit.\n\nPredictive profiling's goal is the prevention of a crime. Undercover security forces may confront suspects at locations far from home to gather more information. If someone who poses a threat comes face to face with an authority figure, they may become too scared to execute their intended criminal activity.\n\nWhen a company is operating at \"business as usual\" it is in its modus operandi. For investors and other stakeholders, this means stability. In this state, employees are carrying out their routines, customers are making purchases, and vendors are being paid.\n\nDisruptions to the modus operandi instead introduce question marks and increases volatility. Predictions and forecasts are harder to make when the modus operandi is interrupted, and losses may be incurred as a result.\n\nModus operandi can also be taken with a negative connotation in business. If a company is merely operating habitually, it cannot grow, innovate, and adapt. As such, there needs to be a balance between maintaining \"business as usual\" and seeking new opportunities.\n\nBusinesses can utilize predictive profiling to identify potential customer segments and create targeted advertising and marketing campaigns based on their M.O.s.\n\nAs an example, aPonzi scheme's M.O. involves taking money from new investors and using it to pay off existing investors, to create the appearance that the latter group of individuals is drawing impressive returns on their capital investments.\n\nA straight-A student's M.O. might be to complete homework assignments before they are due, achieve a perfect attendance record, and visit with professors weekly during their office hours.\n\nAn individual's daily routine may be considered an M.O. where someone follows the same order of activities, in an effort to regulate their lifestyles and live as efficiently as possible. M.O.s may also apply to business protocol. For example, when meeting a new contact, an M.O. might be to shake hands and make eye contact in order to establish a connection.\n\nModus operandi is Latin, where it may be translated literally as \"way of operating.\"\n\nModus operandi is sometimes abbreviated as M.O. Therefore, one's M.O. refers to their usual patterns of behaviors or habits.\n\nModus operandi, or M.O. was popularized in the context of criminal investigations. Suspects could be identified and captured based on understanding their usual habits, hangouts, and contacts. Because of that, the phrase may still carry negative connotations. That said, a modus operandi can also be neutral or even positive when used to describe non-criminal activities.\n\nModus operandi refers to the typical patterns of behavior, interactions, and locales of an individual or organization. From the Latin, meaning \"way of operating\" modus operandi can be used to predict outcomes based on these patterns of behavior and has been used by law enforcement and regulators to identify criminal activities. Predictive profiling can also be used by businesses to identify potential customer segments and create targeted advertising and marketing campaigns.\n\nMIT Technology Review. \"Predictive Profiling Is Still Racist\u2014Whatever Data It Uses.\"",
