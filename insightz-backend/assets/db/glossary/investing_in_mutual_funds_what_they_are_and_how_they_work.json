  "term": "Investing in Mutual Funds: What They Are and How They Work",
  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA mutual fund is a financial vehicle in which shareholders put their money together to invest in securities (e.g., stocks, bonds, money market instruments). A fund manager chooses the best investments, and every investor shares in the profits if the investments do well.\n\nA mutual fund gathers money from many investors to purchase a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. For millions of Americans, these funds are the cornerstone of their retirement savings, offering professional management and built-indiversificationthat would be difficult to achieve on their own.\n\nIn a mutual fund, investors pool their money to buy assets together, benefiting from shared costs and professional expertise. Rather than buying individual stocks or bonds, you buy shares in the fund itself, becoming partial owners of all its holdings.\n\nWhen you invest in a mutual fund, you\u2019re essentially hiring professional money managers to make investment decisions on your behalf. These managers research opportunities, select securities, and monitor performance according to the fund\u2019s stated objectives\u2014whether that\u2019s aggressive growth, steady income, or matching a market index.\n\nMutual funds are portfolios of investments funded by all those who have bought shares in the fund. When someone buys shares in a mutual fund, they gain part-ownership of all of the fund\u2019s underlying assets. The fund\u2019s performance depends on its assets\u2014if it\u2019s full of stocks going up, it will go up. If they\u2019re going down, so will the fund.\n\nWhile a mutual fund manager oversees the portfolio, deciding how to divide money across sectors, industries, companies, etc., based on the fund\u2019s strategy, many mutual funds are so-called index orpassive funds, with portfolios that shouldn\u2019t need too much management. They simply mirror the assets of indexes like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nThe biggest fund managers areVanguard and Fidelity.\n\nThe reason mutual funds are so often the default for retirement accounts like 401(k)s is that they let you instantly diversify across hundreds of securities with a relatively modest amount of money.\n\nThe number of American households invested in mutual funds has increased significantly since they were introduced about half a century ago, from about 6% of households in 1980 to about 53% in the mid-2020s, including about 35% of Gen Z households.Together, American households own about 88% of all mutual fund assets.\n\nMutual funds give everyday investors access to a diverse investment menu they likely couldn\u2019t build on their own. Rather than putting all your money into one stock or bond\u2014which can be risky\u2014a mutual fund spreads your investments across many different securities.\n\nInvesting in mutual funds is relatively straightforward, involving the following steps:\n\nThere are many types among the more than 8,800 mutual funds in the United States, with most in four main categories: stock, money market, bond, and target-date funds.\n\nTarget-date fundsoffer a straightforward approach to retirement investing by automatically adjusting their mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets based on when you plan to retire. These mutual funds, which often have years like \u201c2045\u201d or \u201c2050\u201d in their names, start with aggressive growth strategies and gradually become more conservative as you approach retirement.\n\nThese funds requireactive management\u2014but not from you. Earlier in your career, the fund might invest 90% of your money in stocks for growth potential. As you near retirement, it shifts more money into bonds and cash to help protect your nest egg from market swings.\n\nFor example, a 30-year-old planning to retire in 2065 might choose a \u201c2065 Target Date Fund.\u201d Initially, this fund would primarily hold stocks. Over time, it automatically rebalances to include more conservative investments, cutting down on risk when you can least afford major losses.\n\nHowever, target-date funds aren\u2019t one-size-fits-all. Their fees can vary significantly, and their investment strategies\u2014known asglide paths\u2014differ among fund companies. Some funds maintain significant stock exposure even after retirement, while others take a moreconservativeapproach.\n\nMore than 90% of employee retirement plans in the U.S. use target-date funds as their default.\n\nThis type of fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are assorted subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: firms with small-sized, midsized, or large-sizedcapitalization. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, and value. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in U.S. stocks or foreign equities. To understand how these strategies and sizes of assets can combine, you can use an equity-style box like the example below.\n\nValue fundsinvest in stocks their managers see as undervalued while aiming at long-term appreciation when the market recognizes the stocks\u2019 true worth. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book ratios, and dividend yields. Meanwhile, growth funds look to companies with solid earnings, sales, and cash flow growth. These companies typically have high price-to-earnings ratios and do not pay much in dividends.A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a \u201cblend.\u201d These funds invest in a mix of growth and value stocks to give a risk-to-reward profile somewhere in the middle.\n\nLarge-cap companies havemarket capitalizationsof over $10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically for blue-chip firms whose names are recognizable. Small-cap stocks have a market cap between $250 million and $2 billion. These companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Midcap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap.\n\nA mutual fund may combine different investment styles and company sizes. For example, a large-cap value fund might include in its portfolio large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall; these would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). The opposite of this would be a small-cap growth fund that invests in startup technology companies with high growth prospects. This kind of fund is in the bottom right quadrant above (small and growth).\n\nA mutual fund that generates a consistent and minimum return is part of thefixed-incomecategory. These mutual funds focus on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and otherdebt instruments. The bonds should generate interest income that\u2019s passed on to the shareholders, with limited investment risk.\n\nThere are also actively managed funds that look for relatively undervalued bonds to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds will likely pay higher returns but aren\u2019t without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities.\n\nBecause there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where and when they invest, and all bond funds haveinterest rate risk.\n\nMost mutual funds are part of larger investment companies orfund familiessuch as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer.\n\nIndex mutual fundsare designed to replicate the performance of a specific index, such as the S&P 500. This passive strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so fewer expenses are passed on to investors through fees, and these funds are designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.\n\nThey also frequently outperform actively managed mutual funds and thus potentially are the rare combination in life of lower costs and better performance.\n\nBalanced funds invest across different securities, whether stocks, bonds, themoney market, or alternative investments. The objective of these funds, known as an asset allocation fund, is to cut risk through diversification.\n\nThe money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. The returns on them aren\u2019t substantial. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regularchecking or savings accountand a little less than the averagecertificate of deposit (CD). Money market mutual funds are often used as a temporary holding place for cash that will be used for future investments or an emergency fund.\n\nWhile low risk, they aren\u2019t insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) like savings accounts or CDs.\n\nIncome fundsare meant to disburse income on a steady basis, and are often seen as the mutual funds for retirement investing. They invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may rise in value, the primary goal is to offer a steady cash flow\u200b.\n\nAninternational mutual fund, or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investor\u2019s home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere worldwide. Their volatility depends on where and when the funds are invested.\n\nSector mutual fundsaim to profit from the performance of specific industries, such as finance, technology, or healthcare. Theme funds can cut across sectors. For example, a fund focused on artificial intelligence (AI) might have holdings in firms in healthcare, defense, and other areas employing and building out AI beyond the tech industry.\n\nSocially responsible investinginvests only in companies and sectors that meet preset criteria. For example, somesocially responsible fundsdon\u2019t invest in industries like tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power.Sustainable mutual fundsinvest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling.\n\nThere are also funds that reviewenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG)factors when choosing investments. This approach focuses on the company\u2019s management practices and whether they tend toward environmental and community improvement.\n\nBelow are five large mutual funds that represent a range of the types of funds listed above:\n\nThe oldest such mutual fund, VFIAX tracks theS&P 500 Index, making it a way to invest in 500 of America\u2019s largest companies with a single purchase. With a very low 0.04% expense ratio (meaning you pay 40 cents annually per $1,000 invested), it requires a $3,000 minimum investment. Since its launch half a century ago, the fund has returned an average of about 8.19% annually.\n\nLike Vanguard\u2019s offering, it charges even less: just 0.015% in annual expenses (15 cents per $1,000 invested) and has no minimum investment requirement. The fund invests in technology, financial, healthcare, and consumer companies, closely matching the S&P 500 Index while maintaining flexibility to invest up to 20% outside the index.\n\nThis actively managed fund focuses on companies that consistently pay and increase their regular cash payments to shareholders. While its 0.64%expense ratiois higher than index funds, the strategy targets stable, financially healthy companies. The minimum investment is $2,500.\n\nFor investors seeking global diversification, this fund offers exposure to non-U.S. companies with no fees, a 0% expense ratio. The fund focuses on established international companies to help manage risk while providing worldwide investment exposure.\n\nThis fund provides broad exposure to U.S. bonds, primarily government, and high-quality corporate debt. With a 0.04% expense ratio and a $3,000 minimum investment, it\u2019s designed to provide steady income and help balance out the stock market\u2019s risks.\n\nWhile many mutual funds are \u201cno-load,\u201d you can frequently avoid brokerage fees and commissions anyway by purchasing a fund directly from the mutual fund company instead of going through an intermediary.\n\nThe value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities it invests in. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, you get a part of its portfolio value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund differs from investing in stock shares. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders voting rights. And unlike exchange-traded funds (ETFs), you can\u2019t trade your shares throughout the trading day.\n\nMutual fund share prices come from the net asset value (NAV) per share, sometimes listed asNAVPS. A fund\u2019s NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the number of shares outstanding.\n\nMutual fund shares are typically bought or redeemed at the fund\u2019s NAV, which doesn\u2019t fluctuate during market hours but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled.\n\nInvestors typically earn returns from a mutual fund in three ways:\n\nWhen researching the returns of a mutual fund, you\u2019ll typically come upon a figure for the \u201ctotal return,\u201d or the net change in value (either up or down) over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund has generated, along with the change in its market value during a given period. In most cases, total returns are given for one-, five-, and 10-year periods, as well as from the day the fund opened.\n\nThere are many reasons why mutual funds have been theretail investor\u2019s vehicle of choice, with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in particular, has long paid very close attention to how these funds are run, given their importance to so many Americans and their retirements.\n\nDiversification: A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. A mutual fund can achieve diversification faster and more cheaply than buying individual securities.\n\nEase of Access: Since they trade on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, for certain types of assets, like foreign equities orexotic commodities, mutual funds are often the most workable\u2014sometimes the only\u2014way for individual investors to participate.\n\nEconomies of Scale: Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could.\n\nProfessional Management: A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums, providing a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management.\n\nTransparency: Mutual funds are subject to industry regulations meant to ensure accountability and fairness for investors. In addition, the component securities of each mutual fund can be found across many platforms.\n\nMutual fund managers are legally obligated to follow the fund\u2019s stated mandate and to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.\n\nLiquidity, diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options. However, there are drawbacks:\n\nNo FDIC Guarantee: Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund willdepreciate. Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the fund\u2019s portfolio. The FDIC does not guarantee mutual fund investments.\n\nCash Drag: To maintain liquidity and the ability to accommodate withdrawals, mutual funds typically have to keep a larger percentage of their portfolio as cash than other investments. Because this cash earns no return, it\u2019s called a \u201ccash drag.\u201d\n\nHigher Costs: Fees that reduce your overall payout from a mutual fund are assessed regardless of the fund\u2019s performance. Failing to pay attention to the fees can cost you, since actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate and compound year over year.\n\nDilution:Dilutionis also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds with solid track records, the manager could have trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use.\n\nThe SEC requires that funds have at least 80% of their assets in the particular type of investment implied by their title.How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the categories that qualify for 80% of the assets can be vague and wide-ranging.\n\nEnd-of-Day Trading Only: A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash anytime. However, unlike stocks and ETFs that trade throughout the day, mutual fundredemptionscan only take place at the end of the trading day.\n\nTaxes: When the mutual fund manager sells a security, a capital gains tax is triggered, which can be extended to you. ETFs, for example, avoid this through their creation and redemption mechanism. Your taxes can be lowered by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a401(k)orindividual retirement account (IRA).\n\nAbility to buy and sell shares relatively quickly\n\nMinimal investment requirements\n\nFees, commissions, and other expenses\n\nLarge cash presence in portfolios\n\nLack of transparency in holdings\n\nWhen investing in mutual funds, it\u2019s essential tounderstand the fees associated with them, since these costs will significantly affect your investment returns over time. Here are some common mutual fund fees:\n\nExpense ratio: This is an annual fee that covers the fund\u2019s operating expenses, including management fees, administrative costs, and marketing expenses. Theexpense ratiois given as a percentage of the fund\u2019s average net assets and is deducted from the fund\u2019s returns. Pressured by competition from index investing and ETFs, mutual funds have lowered their expense ratios by more than half over the last 30 years (see below).\n\nSales charges or loads: Some mutual funds charge sales fees, known asloads, when you buy or sell shares. Front-end loads are charged when you buy shares, while back-end loads (or contingent and deferred sales charges) are assessed if you sell your shares before a certain date. Sometimes, however, management firms offerno-load mutual funds, which don\u2019t have commission or sales charges.\n\nRedemption fees: Some mutual funds charge aredemption feewhen you sell shares within a short period (usually 30 to 180 days) after purchasing them, which the SEC limits to 2%.This fee is designed to discourage short-term trading in these funds for stability.\n\nOther account fees: Some funds or brokerage firms may charge extra fees for maintaining your account or transactions, especially if your balance falls below a certain minimum.\n\nResearching and comparing fundscan be more difficult than for other securities. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, sales growth,earnings per share, or other important data. A mutual fund\u2019s NAV can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely\u00a0comparable.\n\n\u201cDiworsification\u201d\u2014a play on words that defines the concept\u2014is an investment term for when too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to overcomplicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are too similar and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification.\n\nIndex funds are mutual funds that aim to replicate the performance of a market benchmark or index. For example, an S&P 500 index fund tracks that index by holding the 500 companies in the same proportions. A key goal of index funds is minimizing costs to mirror their index closely.\n\nBy contrast, actively managed mutual funds try to beat the market by stock picking and shifting allocations. The fund manager seeks to achieve returns greater than a benchmark through their investing strategy and research.\n\nIndex funds offer market returns at lower costs, while active mutual funds aim for higher returns through skilled management that often comes at a higher price. When deciding between index or actively managed mutual fund investing, investors should consider costs,time horizons, andrisk appetite.\n\nMutual funds and ETFs are pooled investment funds that offer investors a stake in a diversified portfolio. \u200bHowever, there are some crucial differences.\n\nAmong the most important is that ETF shares are traded on stock exchanges like regular stocks, while mutual fund shares are traded only once daily after markets close. This means ETFs can be traded anytime during market hours, offering more liquidity, flexibility, and real-time pricing. This flexibility means you can short-sell them or engage in the many strategies you would use for stocks.\n\nAnother significant difference is pricing and valuation. ETF prices, like stocks, fluctuate throughout the day according to supply and demand. Meanwhile, mutual funds are priced only at the end of each trading day based on the NAV of the underlying portfolio. This also means that ETFs have the potential for larger premiums/discounts to NAV than mutual funds.\n\nCompared with mutual funds, ETFs tend to have certain tax advantages and are often more cost-efficient.\n\nAll investments involve some degree ofriskwhen purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds\u2014and the actual risk of a particular mutual fund will depend on its investment strategy, holdings, and manager\u2019s competence. Unlike deposits at banks and credit unions, the money invested in mutual funds isn\u2019t FDIC- or otherwise insured.\n\nYes. Mutual funds are generally highly liquid investments, meaning you can redeem your shares on any business day. However, there may be fees or penalties associated with early withdrawals, such asredemption feesor short-term trading fees, which some funds impose to discourage people from frequently trading in and out of the funds.\n\nWithdrawing funds may have tax implications, particularly if the investment has appreciated in value, which means you\u2019ll have to pay taxes on the capital gains.\n\nYes, many make money for retirement and other savings goals through capital gains distributions, dividends, and interest income.As securities in the mutual fund\u2019s portfolio increase in value, the value of the fund\u2019s shares typically rises, leading to capital gains. However, returns are not guaranteed, and the performance of a mutual fund depends on market conditions, the fund\u2019s management, what assets it holds, and its investment strategy.\n\nDepending on the assets they hold, mutual funds carry several investment risks, includingmarket, interest rate, andmanagement risk. Market risk arises from the potential decline in the value of the securities within the fund. Interest rate risk affects funds holding bonds and other fixed-income securities, as rising interest rates can decrease bond prices. Management risk is linked to the performance of the fund\u2019s management team. You are putting your money in their hands, and poor investment decisions will negatively impact your returns.\n\nMutual funds are versatile and accessible for those looking to diversify their portfolios. These funds combine money from investors for stocks, bonds, real estate, derivatives, and other securities\u2014all managed for you. Key benefits include access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios and the ability to choose funds tailored to different objectives and risk tolerances. However, mutual funds come with fees and expenses, including annual fees, expense ratios, and commissions, that will help determine your overall returns.\n\nInvestors can choose from many types of mutual funds, such as stock, bond, money market, index, and target-date funds, each with its own investment focus and strategy. The returns on mutual funds come from dividends or interest and selling fund shares at a profit.\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \u201cInvestment Company Fact Book.\u201d\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \u201cThe New Face of Fund Ownership: A Bigger and More Diverse Marketplace.\u201d\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \u201cMajority Of American Households Rely on Mutual Funds to Save and Invest.\u201d\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \u201c2024 Investment Company Fact Book.\u201d\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \u201cQuick Facts On Target Date Funds.\u201d\n\nVanguard, Institutional Investors. \u201cA Look Back On 20 Years of Vanguard Target Retirement Funds.\u201d\n\nMorningstar. \u201cMorningstar\u2122 Style Box.\u201d Page 1.\n\nMorningstar, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cLarge Growth Funds.\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cMarket Cap Explained.\u201d\n\nVanguard, Personal Investors. \u201cVFIAX: Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares.\u201d\n\nFidelity, Mutual Funds Research. \u201cFXAIX: Fidelity\u00ae 500 Index Fund.\u201d\n\nT.
