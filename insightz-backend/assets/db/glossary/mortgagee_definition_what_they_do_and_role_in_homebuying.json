  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA mortgagee is a lender, specifically an entity that lends money to a borrower to purchase real estate. In amortgagetransaction, the lender serves as the mortgagee, and the borrower is known as the mortgagor.\n\nMost people take out amortgageto finance the purchase of a residence or commercial building. To limit its risk in the investment, the lender in the transaction creates a priority legal interest in the property's value, substantially lowering the probability that it, the mortgagee, will not be repaid in full if the borrower defaults on the loan. This is done through aperfected lienand title ownership.\n\nA mortgagee represents the interests of the lending financial institution in a mortgage deal. Lending institutions can offer a variety of products to borrowers, representing a significant portion of loan assets for both individuallendersand the credit market overall.\n\nMortgagees can structure mortgage loans with either a fixed or variable rate of interest. Most mortgage loans follow anamortization schedulethat provides steady monthly cash flow to the lending institution in the form of installment payments until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. Standard fixed-rate installment mortgage loans are generally the most common type of mortgage loan issued by lenders. Adjustable-rate mortgage loans can also be offered as avariable-ratemortgage product.\n\nLenders can also issue non-amortizing loans. However, these products are not typicallyqualified mortgagesand carry much higher risk. Non-amortizing loans may have either fixed or variable rates. They are loans that defer principal cash flows for the borrower to one lump sum payment. During the duration of the loan, interest payments may or may not be required. Popular types of non-amortizing mortgage loans are balloon payment loans andinterest-onlyloans.\n\nMortgage loans are one of the most popular types of secured loans in the credit market.\n\nIn a mortgage loan, the mortgagee has rights to the real estate collateral associated with the loan. This provides the lender with protection againstdefault. However, certain provisions must be made for seizing collateral assets if default occurs. For this reason, mortgagees include a perfected lien and integrate title rights into a mortgage lending contract.\n\nA lender\u2019s legal counsel drafts a perfected lien to allow a mortgagee to easily obtain the real estate associated with a mortgage loan if themortgagordefaults. A perfected lien is alienthat has been filed and recorded with the appropriate agency, giving the mortgagee the right to obtain real estate collateral more easily. In a secured mortgage loan, the mortgagee is also the named real estate property owner on the property\u2019s title. With the lien and property title, a mortgagee can easily obtain legal rights and institute specific procedures for vacating a property to be taken over in foreclosure.\n\nThe term \"mortgagee\" refers to a lender, so the terms can be used interchangeably. A borrower might also be referred to as the mortgagor.\n\nSince the mortgagee is the lender, its job is to provide funds for the borrower, in this case, the buyer looking for a mortgage.\n\nA mortgagee is the bank or lender that lends money to the borrower. A mortgagee is not a person who owns the property.\n\nA mortgagee is simply the lender or bank financing a mortgage. Mortgage loans use fixed or variable interest rates, and they usually follow an amortization schedule to provide steady payments to the lender. Protections are put into place so the mortgagee won't lose out if the borrower defaults on the loan.\n\nCornell Law School: Legal Information Institute. \"Mortgage.\"\n\nNorth Carolina General Assembly. \"Chapter 44A Statutory Liens and Charges,\" Pages 17\u201322, 35.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Understanding Loan Options.\"\n\nUniversity of California: Office of Loan Programs. \"Loan Terminology Glossary.\"\n\nMcKinsey & Company. \"Five Trends Reshaping the US Home Mortgage Industry.\"",
