  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS) is a service provided by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The service allows taxpayers to make tax payments either by telephone or online. This system is accessible every day of the week, 24 hours a day.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nEFTPS can be utilized by corporations or individuals seeking to make payments on personal income taxes. The primary function is the convenience of allowing\u00a0secure payments around personal schedules and avoiding the need to make payments in person or through the mail.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIndividuals or businesses wishing to submit tax payments to theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)may use the\u00a0EFTPS. However, users must plan ahead if using EFTPS. The service can only be used for payments after enrollment, a process that can take up to a week. While the system makes secure tax payments simple, it requires users to take a few steps beforehand. The\u00a0initial online registration is followed by physical mail sent to the address provided at registration. The mail includes verification of the bank account for the debiting of payments and a uniquepersonal identification number (PIN).\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe IRS recommends using the\u00a0EFTPS to makeestimated taxpayments.\ufeff\ufeff Taxpayers may schedule advance payments, which can be modified later if unexpected changes occur.\ufeff\ufeff Such changes can include a shortage of funds in the funding account.\n\nUsing an electronic password, taxpayers may access their personal and business tax records and accounts. If EFTPS is not working correctly or is unavailable for any reason, taxpayers still must make timely payments in person or through the mail.\u00a0As of Jan. 2020, taxpayers may access the\u00a0EFTPS\u00a0voice response system at 1-800-555-3453, speak to a customer service agent at 1-800-555-4477, or log on to\u00a0EFTPS.gov.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe EFTPS website uses a secure server, complete with internal security policies and firewalls, to prevent unwanted and unintended parties from gaining access to users\u2019 financial information.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOnly explicitly scheduled or authorized\u00a0payments can be processed by the site. Furthermore, the EFTPS website requires enrollees to input their PIN received as part of the enrollment process. Also, theirtaxpayer identification numberand password must be entered to access the site and perform functions connected to sensitive financial information.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe most significantrisk when using EFTPSis the potential forphishingscams that occur outside of the EFTPS website. In the past, fraudulent emails were sent that targeted EFTPS users, indicating that identification numbers were rejected or prompting users to follow an embedded link to change personal information. Such a link, instead, installed malware on users\u2019 computers and was used to intercept banking information. All users are advised to contact EFTPS if any suspicious emails are received.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"About EFTPS.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Estimated Taxes.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"EFTPS: The Electronic Federal Tax Payment System.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"Contact Us.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"Welcome to EFTPS.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"Security.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Beware of E-Mail Scams about Electronic Federal Tax Payments.\" Accessed Jan. 29, 2020.",
