  "term": "House Maintenance Requirements: What it is, How it Works",
  "definition": "A house maintenance requirement is the level of minimummargin accountequity that is required by a brokerage firm. House maintenance requirement levels are based on the standards set out inRegulation Tof theFederal Reserve.\n\nAlthough Regulation T specifies the minimum maintenance requirements permitted by law,brokerage firmsare free to adjust their own \u201chouse\u201d maintenance requirements, provided that their standards are more rigorous than the minimum requirements set out in Regulation T.\n\nThe purpose of maintenance requirements is to ensure that investors using margin accounts to makeleveraged investmentsdo not find themselves unable to repay theirmargin loans. In this manner, maintenance requirements are intended to reduce credit risk for the brokerage firms. By extension, they aim to reduce thesystemic riskthat might otherwise arise from widespreaddefaultsby margin traders.\n\nHouse maintenance requirements typically range between 30% and 50%. Whilestocksare thesecuritymost commonly purchased in a margin account, many other securities such as mutual funds, Treasuries, corporate bonds, and options may be purchased \"on margin\" subject to varying purchase and maintenance requirements.\n\nAccording to Regulation T, margin traders must maintain equity levels of at least 25% of the value of their investments. If they fail to maintain this level, they may find themselves subject to amargin callby their broker.\n\nIn this situation, the trader would be required to promptly deposit additionalcollateralinto their account. If they fail to do so, their broker canliquidatetheir investment positions in order to pay back their margin. Any outstanding balance of the loan would then need to be repaid separately by the margin trader.\n\nDuringbull markets, margin traders may find their maintenance requirements to be unduly restrictive. When asset prices are generally rising, it can be tempting to leverage as much as possible in order to maximizereturn on equity (ROE).\n\nHowever, the danger of this quickly reveals itself once the market begins to turn. During bear markets or periods of sudden financial shock such as occurred in the2007\u20132008 financial crisis, margin traders are often faced with significant risk.\n\nThe decline in portfolio values, combined with the need to repay large margin loans on short notice due to margin calls, can sometimes force margin traders into significant financial duress.\n\nOften, these traders will forfeit all of the gains made in previous years, and may even be forced to liquidate other personal assets in order to repay their margin loans. Therefore, from this perspective, the need for maintenance requirements becomes much more clear.\n\nIf the equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the broker issues a margin call.\n\nThe house maintenance requirement will often be higher than themaintenance marginset out by the Federal Reserve's Regulation T, which stipulates that an equity level of at least 25% must be maintained.\n\nIn addition to maintaining higher, more stringent house maintenance requirements than the 25% mandated by Regulation T, brokerage firms often also have different house maintenance requirements for different account holders. Typically, this stratification is based on the size,creditworthiness, or perceived sophistication of the client.\n\nFor example, smaller and less experienced margin traders may be required to adhere to a 40% house maintenance requirement, while larger and more experienced clients may receive a 30% threshold.\n\nThe type of investment can also have an impact. For example, small, more volatile stocks may carry higher margin requirements than an investment in a big, well-established S&P 500 company.\n\nThe minimum maintenance requirement by law is 25%, which was set out by Regulation T. However, brokers are free to be more rigorous and most are.\n\nA maintenance requirement of 30% means an investor borrowing on margin must have at least 30% of the total market value of the securities in their margin account at all times.\u00a0 So, if the securities that you borrowed money to buy are valued at $20,000, the maintenance requirement would be $6,000.\n\nThe same maintenance requirements are not uniformly applied to everyone and everything. Some securities can carry higher maintenance requirements because they are deemed riskier. That's usually the case with more volatile or less liquid investments.\n\nA house maintenance requirement is the minimum equity an investor must hold in their margin account after making a purchase. Once a security is bought on margin, the requirement kicks in.\n\nRegulation T demands that at least 25% of the total market value of the securities be in the account at all times. However, brokers tend to demand even more than that.\u00a0It\u2019s very important to pay attention to these requirements. If you fall below them and don\u2019t act fast when prompted, your broker could liquidate your investment positions to claw the money back.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations. \"Part 220\u2014Credit by Brokers and Dealers (Regulation T).\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Know What Triggers a Margin Call.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Brokerage Accounts: Margin Accounts.\"\n\nTD Ameritrade. \"Margin Handbook,\" Page 6.\n\nCharles Schwab. \"The Charles Schwab & Co.
