  "definition": "MRP II is a resource planning system used to optimize the manufacturing process.\n\nManufacturing resource planning (MRP II) is a process used by businesses to determine and allocate the resources needed for efficient manufacturing.\n\nIt combines the data gathering and input efforts of a company's personnel with the processing advantage of a computer system.\n\nMRP II is designed to centralize, integrate, and process information for effective decision-making related to the scheduling, design engineering,inventory management, andcost controlrequired for manufacturing.\n\nMRP II is a computer-based system that can create detailed production schedules using real-time data.\n\nThese are then used to coordinate the arrival of component materials with machine and labor availability. This ensures a smooth-running manufacturing process.\n\nMRP II is an extension of the previous MRP (materials requirement planning), which was one of the first software-based integrated information systems designed to improveproductivityfor businesses.\n\nThe MRP\u00a0information system was a sales forecast\u2013based system used to schedule raw materialdeliveriesand quantities based on assumptions about the machine and labor units required to fulfill a sales forecast.\n\nBy the 1980s manufacturers realized they needed software that could also tie into their accounting systems and forecast inventory requirements. MRP II was the solution.\n\nMRP II is used on its own or as a module within a more extensiveenterprise resource planning (ERP)system.\n\nERP is a process by which a company, often a manufacturer, coordinates and manages the essential parts of its business to achieve its company-wide objectives as effectively as possible. Both MRP and MRP II are seen as predecessors to ERP.\n\nAn ERP management information system integrates planning, purchasing, inventory, sales, marketing, finance, andhuman resources.\n\nERP is most frequently used in the context of software, and manylarge applicationshave been developed to help companies implement it.\n\nMRP II evolved beyond the original MRP system's planning for required materials by adding workforce planning, capacity scheduling, and cost management.\n\nMRP II is not proprietary software and thus is offered by a variety of providers:\n\nMRP II has effectively replaced MRP software, as most MRP II systems deliver all of the MRP functionality and more.\n\nIn addition to offering master production scheduling, bill of materials (BOM), and inventory tracking, MRP II provides functionality within logistics, marketing, and general finance.\n\nMRP II is able to account for variables that MRP didn't, including machine and personnel capacity. It provides a more realistic and holistic representation of a company\u2019s operating capabilities.\n\nMany MRP II solutions also offer simulation features that allow operators to enter variables and see the downstream effect. Because of its ability to provide feedback on a given operation, MRP II is sometimes referred to as a\u201cclosed-loop\u201d system.\n\nMRP included the following three major functionalities:\n\nMRP II includes those three, plus the following:\n\nMRP II systems are still in wide use by manufacturing companies today and can either be found as stand-alone solutions or as part of an ERP system, which is regarded as the successor to MRP II software.\n\nERP suites include applications well outside the scope of manufacturing. These can include everything from human resources and customer relationship management to enterprise asset management.\n\nMRP II incorporates all the MRP system functionality and more. As a result, it has replaced MRP.\n\nYes. All MRP II systems are run by software. But employees collaborate by gathering and entering data for MRP II to use. They also monitor results.\n\nAn ERP system is broader based than an MRP II system in that it includes subjects outside the purview of manufacturing, such as human resources and customer relations. It incorporates MRP II as just one of its components.\n\nMRP II is a resource planning system used by manufacturing businesses to implement a delay-free, efficient, and successful manufacturing process.\n\nIt replaced MRP, a previous and simpler system, and is incorporated into even broader-based ERP systems as one component.\n\nMISys Manufacturing. \"What Is MRP?
