  "definition": "How to divide and conquer your target market\n\nMarket segmentation separates a large group of prospective buyers into smaller groups for more focused marketing.\n\nMarket segmentation is a powerful strategy by which businesses design and market their products and services more effectively for the results they seek. It can be crucial to their sales and financial success.\n\nMarket segmentation starts with categorizing potential customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as demographics, behaviors, geography, or psychographics.\n\nBusinesses can then develop differentmarketing strategies\u2014and often different products\u2014for each segment, according to their needs and tastes, to improve customer engagement and conversion rates.\n\nIn addition, a well-conceived and well-designed market segmentation process can give a company an advantage over its competitors. It can increase the satisfaction of customers by making them feel that their personal preferences are being directly addressed.\n\nCompanies also use market segmentation in product pricing and choice of distribution channels.\n\nThe most common types of characteristics used to segment are briefly described below.\n\nDemographicsegmentation categorizes potential customers based on common demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, income, education, occupation, and family size.\n\nGeographic segmentation is based on a simple truth: People who live in different places have different tastes or needs.\n\nSo, it only makes sense for companies to market differently to different regions and, in many cases, design entirely different products.\n\nBehavioral segmentation classifies potential consumers according to such things as their purchasing habits, the number of brand interactions, and decision-making patterns.\n\nWhile traditional market segmentation targeted broad categories, online advertising has revolutionized how businesses target customers based on browsing history, app usage, and online shopping patterns.\n\nPsychographic segmentation classifies consumers based on their psychological traits, such as their values, beliefs, interests, and social status.\n\nThis helps companies to better understand potential customers' motivations and to refine their marketing strategies accordingly.\n\nFirmographic segmentation is the business-to-business version of demographic segmentation.\n\nPotential business customers are categorized according to such characteristics as industry, company size, location, revenue, growth stage, and organizational structure.\n\nAn effective market segmentation strategy offers businesses many benefits that ultimately add up to designing, producing, and marketing the right products to the right people.\n\nThis is achieved by understanding and targeting specific types of customers rather than a large, ill-defined, general group of them.\n\nSome of the specific benefits gained from market segmentation include:\n\nThere are five basic steps to market segmentation:\n\nWhile market segmentation can be a powerful tool, it involves plenty of challenges. Below, we touch on some of the most common:\n\nSegmenting markets can give businesses a competitive advantage by helping them define target markets and then design and market products and services to those specific groups.\n\nBy dividing the larger market into well-defined and deeply researched segments, companies can create more effective marketing strategies, improve customer experience, and maximize profits.\n\nThey can also take what they've learned back to the product design stage to tailor their offerings to other distinct groups.\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"A Brief Primer on the Economics of Targeted Advertising.\"\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Rediscovering Market Segmentation.\"\n\nNielsen IQ. \"Market Segmentation Examples.\"\n\nMcDonald's. \"The Wholesome McAloo Tiki Burger.\"\n\nMcDonald's. \"Teriyaki Chicken Filet-O.\"\n\nPatagonia.Patagonia: Take Action.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Why Identifying Your Target Audience Is Important to Your Marketing Strategy.\"\n\nQualtrics. \"Market Segmentation: Definition, Types, Benefits, & Best Practices.\"",
