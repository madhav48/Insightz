  "term": "What Is a Qualifying Disposition and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAndy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nQualifying disposition refers to a sale, transfer, or exchange of stock that qualifies for favorable tax treatment. Individuals typically acquire this type of stock through an incentive stock option (ISO), or through a qualifiedemployee stock purchase plan (ESPP). A qualified ESPP requires shareholder approval before it is implemented. Furthermore, all plan members must have equal rights in the plan.\n\nTo be a qualifying disposition, the employee must sell their position at least one year after exercising the stock, and two years after theincentive stock option (ISO)was granted, or two years after the beginning of the ESPP offering period.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nFor example, suppose Cathy\u2019s ISO options were granted September 20, 2018, and she exercises them September 20, 2019. In this scenario, Cathy must wait until September 20, 2020, before she may report a long-term capital gain.\n\nThe capital gains treatment for a qualifying disposition applies to the amount of the sale represented by the difference between the exercise price of the option's stock, and the market price at which the stock sold. For example, if Tim exercises 1,000 ISO options at $10 per share, and sells them for $30 per share, he consequently will report a capital gain of $20,000 ($20 x 1000 shares).\ufeff\ufeff\n\nNon-statutory stock options (NSOs) do not qualify for capital gains tax treatment and are taxed at ordinary income rates.\ufeff\ufeff Issuing a compensation package that includes ISOs and a qualified ESPP helps companies attract and retain top-tier personnel. It also aligns a company\u2019s management and key employees with its shareholders, as they all want the company to succeed and increase its share price.\n\nSome companies do not offer ISOs, because contrary to non-statutory (or non-qualified) option plans there is no tax deduction for the company when the options are exercised.\ufeff\ufeff\n\n\u201cBargain element\u201d refers to an option that can be exercised below the current market price, which provides the employee with an immediate profit. An employee who exercises a non-statutory option must report the bargain element as earned income, which is subject to income tax. It should be noted that employees who hold ISOs are not mandated to report the bargain element, until after they sell their shares.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe bargain element is reported as ordinary income if the shares were immediately sold after they were exercised (a disqualifying disposition). By contrast, the bargain element is reported as a long-term capital gain if the sale was executed one year after exercising the options, and two years after the grant date (qualifying disposition).\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe bargain element for NSOs is added to an individual\u2019s alternative minimum taxable income, which has a flat tax meant to ensure everyone pays their fair share of taxes despite tax minimization strategies.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nA disqualifying distribution is the sale or exchange of shares received from an ISO or ESPP before the holding period has been met. The ISO holding period is one year from the exercise date and two years from the grant date or two years from the ESPP offering date. Gains or losses realized in a disqualifying disposition are taxed at a higher rate.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIf ESPP or ISO shares are sold in a qualifying disposition, the bargain amount is taxed at the capital gains rate. Disqualifying dispositions are recorded at theincome taxrate, which is generally higher than the capital gains tax.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nU.S. Office of the Law Revision Counsel. \"26 USC 423: Employee Stock Purchase Plans.\" Accessed Feb. 28, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 427 Stock Options.\" Accessed Feb. 28, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 525 (2020), Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\" Accessed Feb. 28, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Equity (Stock) - Based Compensation Audit Techniques Guide (August 2015).\" Accessed Feb. 28, 2021.",
