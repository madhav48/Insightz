  "term": "What Is the Debt Ratio?",
  "definition": "The debt ratio is a financial metric that measures a company's leverage by comparing its debt to its assets.\n\nThe term \"debt ratio\" refers to a financial ratio that identifies a company\u2019sleverage, or how much borrowing is used as a source of funding.\n\nThe debt ratio is defined as the ratio oftotal debt to total assets, expressed as a decimal or percentage. It can be interpreted as the proportion of a company\u2019s assets that are financed by debt. This is information that's important to sizing up a company's financial health.\n\nA ratio greater than 1 means that a considerable amount of a company's assets is funded by debt. In fact, it indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets.\n\nA high ratio indicates that a company may be at risk of defaulting on its loans if interest rates suddenly rise. A ratio below 1 means that a greater portion of a company's assets is funded by equity.\n\nAs noted above, a company's debt ratio is a measure of theextent of its financial leverage. This ratio varies widely across industries. Capital-intensive businesses, such as utilities and pipelines\u00a0tend to have much higher debt ratios than other companies in, for instance, thetechnology sector.\n\nThe formula for calculating a company's debt ratio is:\n\nDebt\u00a0ratio=Total\u00a0debtTotal\u00a0assets\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Debt ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Total debt}}{\\text{Total assets}} \\end{aligned}\u200bDebt\u00a0ratio=Total\u00a0assetsTotal\u00a0debt\u200b\u200b\n\nSo if a company has total assets of $100 million and total debt of $30 million, its debt ratio is 0.3 or 30%. Is this company in a better financial situation than one with a debt ratio of 40%? The answer depends on theindustry.\n\nA debt ratio of 30% may be too high for an industry with volatilecash flows, in which most businesses take on littledebt. A company with a high\u00a0debt ratio relative to its peers would probably find it expensive to borrow and could find itself in a crunch\u00a0if circumstances change.\n\nConversely, a debt level of 40% may be easily manageable for a company in a sector such as utilities, where cash flows are stable and higher debt ratios are the norm.\n\nA debt ratio greater than 1.0 (100%) tells you that a company has more debt thanassets. A debt ratio of less than 1.0 indicates that a company has more assets than debt. Used in conjunction with other measures of financial health, the debt ratio can help investors determine a company'srisklevel.\n\nThe concept of comparing total assets to total debt also relates to entities that may not be businesses. For example, the United States Department of Agriculture keeps a close eye on how the relationship between farmland assets, debt, and equity change over time.\n\n1. The debt ratio is a simple ratio that is easy to compute and comprehend.\n\n2. It quickly provides an overview of how much debt a firm has in comparison to all of its assets\u2014what it owes compared to what it owns.\n\n3. Because public companies must report these figures as part of their periodic external reporting, the information you need to obtain the debt ratio is readily available.\n\n4. The debt ratio aids in determining a company's capacity to service its long-term debt commitments. As discussed earlier, a lower debt ratio signifies that the business is more financially solid and has a lower chance of insolvency due to unpaid debt.\n\nWith this information, investors can use historical data to make more informed investment decisions about the company's potential for financial success.\n\n5. Last, businesses in the same industry can be contrasted using their debt ratios. They're a way to determine whether one company's debt levels are higher or lower than those of its competitors.\n\nAs is the story with most financial ratios, you can take a company's debt ratio and see how it changes over time, how it compares to competitors', and how it compares tobenchmarks.\n\n1. There are several downsides to the debt ratio as well. It doesn't reveal the type of debt or how much it costs. The terms and interest rates of various debts may differ, which can have a substantial effect on a company's financial stability.\n\n2. In addition, the debt ratio depends on accounting information which may be construed or manipulated by a company for external reports.\n\n3. The debt ratio does not take a company's profitability into account. If its assets provide large earnings, a highly leveraged corporation may have a low debt ratio, making it less hazardous.\n\nContrarily, if the company's assets yield low returns, a low debt ratio does not automatically translate intoprofitability.\n\n4. It's great to compare debt ratios across companies; however, capital intensity and debt needsvary widely across sectors. The financial health of a firm may not be accurately represented by comparing debt ratios across industries.\n\nBear in mind that certain industries may necessitate higher debt ratios due to the initial investment needed.\n\n5. Last, the debt ratio is a constant indicator of a company's financial standing at a certain moment in time. Acquisitions, sales, or changes in asset prices are just a few of the variables that might quickly affect the debt ratio.\n\nAs a result, conclusions purely based on historical debt ratios that don't take into account future predictions may mislead analysts.\n\nA simple ratio that can be easily calculated\n\nDraws from easily accessible public company information\n\nProvides useful insight into the quality of a company's long-term financial health\n\nCompares leverage for one company over different periods, different companies, or company-to-benchmarks\n\nDifferent types of debt or loan terms don't affect ratio\n\nDoes not consider or reflect on a company's profitability\n\nNot useful for comparisons of companies in different industries\n\nMay not appropriately consider future implications of business decisions\n\nSome sources consider the debt ratio to be totalliabilitiesdivided by total assets. This reflects a certain ambiguity about the terms \"debt\" and \"liabilities\". (To be clear, liabilities encompass a company's financial obligations and can reflect transactions other than debt.)\n\nThedebt-to-equity ratio, for example, is closely related to and more common than the debt ratio, but it uses total liabilities as the numerator.\n\nFinancial data providers calculate it using onlylong-termandshort-term debt(includingcurrent portions of long-term debt), excluding liabilities such asaccounts payable,negative goodwill, and others.\n\nIn the consumer lending and mortgage business, two common debt ratios used to assess a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan or mortgage are the grossdebt serviceratio and thetotal debt service ratio.\n\nThe gross debt service ratio is defined as the ratio of monthly housing costs (includingmortgage payments, home insurance, and property costs) to monthly income.\n\nThe total debt service ratio is the ratio of monthly housing costs plus other debt such as car payments and credit card borrowings to monthly income. Acceptable levels of the total debt service ratio range from the mid-30s to the low-40s in percentage terms.\n\nThe higher the debt ratio, the more leveraged a company is, implying greater potential financial risk. At the same time, leverage is an important tool that companies use for growth, and many businesses find sustainable uses for debt.\n\nWhile the\u00a0debt ratio (total debt to total assets)\u00a0includes all debts, thelong-term debt to assets ratioonly takes into account long-term debts.\n\nThe debt ratio takes into account both long-term debts, such as mortgages and securities, and current or short-term debts such as rent, utilities, and loans maturing in less than 12 months.\n\nBoth ratios, however, encompass all of a business's assets, including tangible assets such as equipment and inventory, and intangible assets such as copyrights and owned brands.\n\nBecause the debt ratio includes more of a company's liabilities, this metric\u00a0is almost always higher than a company's long-term debt to assets ratio.\n\nLet's look at a few examples from different industries to contextualize the debt ratio.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) listed $1.92 million in short-term and current portion of long-term debt on its balance sheet for the fiscal year ended Oct. 2, 2022, and $13.1 billion in long-term debt. The company's total assets were $28 billion.SoStarbuck's debt ratiois $15 billion \u00f7\u00a0$28 billion = 0.5357, or 53.6%.\n\nTo assess whether this is high, we should consider thecapital expendituresthat go into opening a Starbucks, including leasing commercial space, renovating it to fit a certain layout, and purchasing expensive specialty equipment, much of which is used infrequently.\n\nThe company must also hire and train employees in an industry with exceptionally high employee turnover, and adhere to food safety regulations for its approximately 18,253 stores.\n\nPerhaps 53.6% isn't that bad when you consider that the industry average was 79% in 2022.The result is that Starbucks had an easy time borrowing money\u2014creditors trusted that it was in a solid financial position and could be expected to pay them back in full.\n\nWhat about a technology company? For the fiscal year ended Dec. 31, 2022, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, reported:\n\nUsing these figures, Meta's debt ratio can be calculated as $26.59 billion \u00f7 $185.7 billion = 0.143, or 14.3%. The company borrowed $10.5 billion from thecorporate bondmarket in 2022 for a variety of purposes, including to invest in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCommon debt ratios include debt-to-equity, debt-to-assets, long-term debt-to-assets, and leverage and gearing ratios.\n\nWhat counts as a good debt ratio will depend on the nature of a business and its industry. Generally speaking, a debt-to-equity or debt-to-assets ratio below 1.0 would be seen as relatively safe, whereas ratios of 2.0 or higher would be considered risky. Some industries, such as banking, are known for having much higher debt-to-equity ratios than others.\n\nA debt-to-equity ratio of 1.5 would indicate that the company in question has $1.50 of debt for every $1 of equity. To illustrate, suppose the company had assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.2 million. Since equity is equal to assets minus liabilities, the company\u2019s equity would be $800,000. Its debt-to-equity ratio would therefore be $1.2 million divided by $800,000, or 1.5.\n\nYes, it can. If a company has a negative debt ratio, it means that the company has negative shareholder equity. In other words, the company's debt is greater than its assets. In most cases, this indicates that the company may be at risk of bankruptcy.\n\nThe debt ratio is a metric that measures a company's total debt, as a percentage of its total assets. A high debt ratio indicates that a company is highly leveraged, and may have borrowed more money than it can easily pay back.\n\nInvestors and accountants use the debt ratio to assess the risk of a company defaulting on its debts.\n\nAccounting Tools. \"Debt Ratio.\"\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture. \"Farm Sector Income & Finances\u2014Assets, Debt, and Wealth.\"\n\nServus Credit Union. \"What's My Debt Service Ratio.\"\n\nMy Accounting Course. \"Long Term Debt to Total Asset Ratio.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended October 2, 2022, Starbucks Corporation,\" Page 43.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended October 2, 2022, Starbucks Corporation,\" Page 6.\n\nReadyRatios. \"Eating and Drinking Places: Average Industry Financial Ratios for U.S. Listed Companies.\"\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Meta Platforms, Inc.
