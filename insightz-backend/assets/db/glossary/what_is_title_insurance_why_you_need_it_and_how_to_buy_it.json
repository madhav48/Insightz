  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nTitle insurance is a form ofindemnity insurancethat protects lenders and homebuyers from financial loss sustained fromdefects in a titleto a property. The most common type of title insurance is lender\u2019s title insurance, which the borrower purchases to protect the lender. The other type is owner\u2019s title insurance, which is often paid for by the seller to protect the buyer\u2019s equity in the property.\n\nAclear titleis necessary for any\u00a0real estate\u00a0transaction. Title companies must do a search on every title to check for claims or liens of any kind against them before they can be issued.\n\nA title search is an examination of public records to determine andconfirm a property\u2019s legal ownershipand determine whether there are any claims on the property. Erroneous surveys and unresolved building code violations are two examples of blemishes that can make the title \u201cdirty.\u201d\n\nTitle insurance protects both lenders and homebuyers against loss or damage occurring from liens, encumbrances, or defects in a property\u2019s title\u00a0or actual ownership. Common claims filed against a title are back taxes, liens (from mortgage loans,home equity lines of credit (HELOCs),easements), and conflicting wills.\u00a0Unlike traditional insurance, which protects against future events, title insurance protects against claims for past occurrences.\n\nA basic owner\u2019s title insurance policy typically covers the following hazards:\n\nIn lieu of title insurance, some private transactions can involve awarranty of title, which is a guarantee by a\u00a0seller\u00a0to a buyer that the seller has the right to transfer ownership and no one else has rights to the property.\n\nThere are two types of title insurance: lender\u2019s title insurance and owner\u2019s title insurance (including extended policies). Almost all lenders require the borrower to purchase a lender\u2019s title insurance policy to protect the lender in the event that the seller was not legally able to transfer the title of ownership rights. A lender\u2019s policy only protects the lender against loss. An issued policy signifies the\u00a0completion of a\u00a0title search, offering some assurance to the buyer.\n\nSincetitle searchesare not infallible and the owner remains at risk of financial loss, there is a need for additional protection in the form of an owner\u2019s title insurance policy. While lender\u2019s title insurance is required for you to get your mortgage loan, owner\u2019s title insurance, which is purchased by the seller to protect the buyer against defects in the title, is optional.\n\nYou might consider owner\u2019s title insurance once you own your home since, as you continue to pay down your mortgage, you now own a greater percentage of your property. As a result, you have more to lose if a claim comes up. This is especially important if you plan on spending a long period of time in your home.\n\nAnescrowor closing agent initiates the insurance process upon completion of the property purchase agreement. There are four major U.S. title insurance underwriters: Fidelity National Financial Inc., First American Title Insurance Co., Old Republic National Title Insurance Co., and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. There are also regional title insurance companies from which to choose.\n\nThe cost of owner\u2019s title insurance ranges from $500 to $3,500, depending on the state where you live, the insurance provider you choose, and the purchase price of your home.\n\nOften, a lender\u2019s policy and an owner\u2019s policy are required together to guarantee that everyone is adequately protected.\u00a0At closing, the parties purchase title insurance for a one-time fee. TheReal Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA)prohibits sellers from requiring purchase from a specific title insurance carrier to prevent abuse.\n\nWhile your lender, lawyer, or real estate agent may recommend a title insurance company, it\u2019s always a good idea to comparison shop.\n\nHaving no title insurance exposes transacting parties to significant risk in the event that a title defect is present.\u00a0Consider a homebuyer searching for the house of their dreams only to find, after closing, unpaidproperty taxesfrom the prior owner.\u00a0Without title insurance, the financial burden of this claim for back taxes rests solely with the buyer.\u00a0They will either pay the outstanding property taxes or risk losing the home to the taxing entity.\n\nUnder the same scenario with title insurance, the coverage protects the buyer for as long as they own\u2014or have an interest in\u2014the property.\n\nSimilarly, lender\u2019s title insurance covers banks and other mortgage lenders from unrecorded liens, unrecorded access rights, and other defects. In case of a borrower\u2019sdefault, if there are any issues with the property\u2019s title, a lender would be covered up to the mortgage amount.\n\nReal estate investors should make sure that a\u00a0property\u00a0does not have a badtitlebefore proceeding with any purchase. Homes inforeclosure, for example, may have a number of outstanding issues. Buyers may consider purchasing owner\u2019s title insurance to protect themselves against unforeseen claims against the title.\n\nThere are two types of title insurance: lender\u2019s title insurance and owner\u2019s title insurance (including extended policies).

The two types of title insurance are lender's title insurance and owner's title insurance.\n\nLender's title insurance is purchased by the borrower to protect the lender from these claims, and is the most common type of title insurance. Lenders almost always require the borrower to buy lender's title insurance. That's because the risk of not having this type of coverage is too great, leaving the\u00a0buyer potentially vulnerable to financial risk if there's a problem with the title. Owner's title insurance is usually bought by the seller to protect the buyer against defects in the title, and is less frequently purchased.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cWhat Is Owner\u2019s Title Insurance?\u201d\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \u201cTitle Insurance.\u201d\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cWhat Is Lender\u2019s Title Insurance?\u201d\n\nZillow. \u201cWhat Is Title Insurance and Do I Need It?\u201d\n\nGovInfo.com. \u201cPublic Law 93-533\u2014Dec. 22, 1974,\u201d Page 1728 (Page 5 of PDF).",
