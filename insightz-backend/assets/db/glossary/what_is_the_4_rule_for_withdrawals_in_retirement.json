  "term": "What Is the 4% Rule for Withdrawals in Retirement?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe 4% rule for retirement budgeting suggests that a retiree should be able to withdraw 4% of the balance in their retirement account(s) in the first year after retiring, and then withdraw the same dollar amount, adjusted forinflation, every year thereafter for approximately 30 years.\n\nSince this rule allows for safe withdrawals for about 30 years, this means it may not provide sustainable income for individuals who retire early.\n\nThe 4% rule is intended to supply a steady stream of income while maintaining an adequate account balance for future years. Assuming a reasonable rate ofreturn on investment, the withdrawals\u00a0will consist\u00a0primarily of interest and dividends.\n\nExperts disagree on whether the 4% rule is the best option. Many, including the creator of the rule, say that 5% is a better rule for all but the worst-case scenario. Others caution that 3% is safer.\n\nThe 4% rule is a guideline used by some financial planners and retirees toestimate a comfortable but safe incomefor retirement.\n\nAn individual'slife expectancyplays an important role in determining whether the rate will be sustainable. Retirees who live longer or retire early need their portfolios to last longer, and theirmedical costsand other expenses can increase with age.\n\nThe concept of the 4% rule\u00a0is attributed to Bill Bengen, a financial adviser in Southern California who created it in the mid-1990s. Some people say that the rule has been over-simplified, because he actually said that the 4% rule was based on a \"worst-case\" scenario and that 5% would be a more realistic number.\n\nThe rule was created using historical data onstockandbondreturns over the 50-year period from 1926 to 1976, focusing heavily on the severe market downturns of the 1930s and early 1970s.\n\nBengen concluded that, even during untenable markets, no historical case existed in which a 4% annual withdrawal rate exhausted a retirement portfolio in fewer than 33 years.\n\nWhile some retirees who adhere to the 4% rule keep their withdrawal rate constant, the rule allows retirees to increase the rate to keep pace with inflation. Possible ways to adjust for inflation include setting a flat annual increase of 2% per year, which is theFederal Reserve'starget inflation rate, or adjusting withdrawals based on actual\u00a0inflation rates. The former method provides steady and predictable increases, while the latter method more effectively matches\u00a0income to cost-of-living\u00a0changes.\n\nWhile the 4% rule recommends maintaining a balanced portfolio of 50% common stocks and 50% intermediate-term Treasury bonds, some financial experts say that you should maintain a different allocation, such as reducing exposure to stocks in retirement in favor of a mix of cash, bonds, and stocks.\n\nWhile following the 4% rule can make it more likely that your retirement savings will last the remainder of your life, it doesn\u2019t guarantee it.\u00a0The rule is based on the past performance of the markets, so it doesn't necessarily predict the future. What was considered a safe investment strategy in the past may not be a safe investment strategy in the future if market conditions change.\n\nThere are several scenarios in which the 4% rule might not work for a retiree. A severe or protracted market downturn can erode the value of a high-risk investment vehicle much faster than it can a typical retirement portfolio.\n\nFurthermore, the 4% rule does not work unless a retiree remains loyal to it year in and year out. Violating the rule one year to splurge on a major purchase can have severe consequences down the road, as this reduces theprincipal, which directly impacts thecompound interestthat you will depend on for sustainability.\n\nHowever, there are obvious benefits to the 4% rule. It is simple to follow and provides for a predictable, steady income. And if it is successful, the 4% rule will protect you from running short of funds in retirement.\n\nProvides predictable, steady income\n\nProtects you from running out of money in retirement\n\nRequires strict adherence (doesn't respond to lifestyle changes)\n\nIs based on a 'worst-case' scenario of portfolio performance\n\n5%, not 4%, may be a more realistic number\n\nAccording to Michael Kitces, a financial planner, the 4% rule was developed to take the worst economic situations into account, such as 1929, and has held up well for those who retired during the two most recent financial crises.\u00a0As Kitces points out:\n\nThis is, of course, not a reason to go beyond it. Safety is a key element for retirees. So even if following the 4% rule may leave those who retire in calmer economic times \"with a huge amount of money left over,\" Kitces notes, \"in general, a 4% withdrawal rate is really quite modest relative to the long-term historical average return of almost 8% on a balanced (60/40) portfolio!\"\n\nMeantime, some experts\u2014pointing to the recent low interest rates on bonds and savings\u2014suggest that 3% might be asafer withdrawal rate. The best strategy is to review your situation with a financial planner, starting withhow much you have saved, what your current investments are, andwhen you plan to retire.\n\nRead about Investopedia's10 Rules of Investingby picking up a copy of our special issue print edition.\n\nThe 4% rule was created to meet the financial needs of an average retiree over an approximately 30-year period, and as such is subject to adjustment depending on market conditions and a retiree's portfolio diversification, tax status, and expenses. Increasing the withdrawal rate to 5% allows for a more comfortable lifestyle, but also adds more risk. Reducing the rate to 3% may make funds last longer, but means you have less spending flexibility.\n\nThe 4% rule is intended to make your retirement savings last for approximately 30 years. In Bengen's original research, each 50-year time horizon sampled managed to sustain at least 33 years of withdraws at 4%. This rate of withdrawals means that most of the money used will be theinterestandgainson investments, not principal, assuming a reasonably healthy marketreturn.\n\nThe 4% rule allows for safe withdrawals for approximately 30 years, which means it may not provide sustainable income for individuals who retire early. If you're hoping to retire early or expect to keep working past age 65, your long-term financial needswill be different.\n\nFor most people, managing retirement savings is a balancing act. If you withdraw too much too fast, you'll risk running out of money.Not withdrawing enough moneycan deny you the full benefit of your hard-earned savings.\n\nFor those who want a rule of thumb to follow, the 4% rule is an imperfect but easy-to-use choice.\n\nCorrection\u2014Sept. 24, 2024:This article has been corrected to state that the 4% rule applies to approximately 30-year retirements and may not be sustainable for early retirements with a retirement horizon greater than 30 years.\n\nMarketWatch. \"The Inventor of the '4% Rule' Just Changed It.\"\n\nFinancial Advisor Magazine. \"How Much Is Enough?\"\n\nMichael Kitces.com. \"How Has The 4% Rule Held Up Since the Tech Bubble and the 2008 Financial Crisis?\"",
