  "term": "Liability-Driven Investment (LDI): What It Is and Examples of Strategies",
  "definition": "Liz Manning has researched, written, and edited trading, investing, and personal finance content for years, following her time working in institutional sales, commercial banking, retail investing, hedging strategies,\u00a0futures, and day trading.\n\nA liability-driven investment (LDI) is an investment in assets that can generate the cash to pay for financial obligations (liabilities).\n\nThis type of investing is common withdefined-benefitpension plans because companies and pension funds are obligated to provide the guaranteed income promised to thebeneficiaries. With the largest pension\u00a0plans, liabilities frequently climb to billions of dollars.\n\nThe goal of investing in LDIs is to make sure that an investor with long-term financial commitments such as a pension fund orinsurance companyhas the income-generating assets it needs to satisfy its financial obligations (e.g., payouts to plan participants and customers making claims).\n\nThus liability-driven investing focuses on matching the cash flow generated by assets to the cash flow required by liabilities and then minimizing risks that could affect returns, such as those associated with interest rate fluctuations and market volatility. Hedging strategies involvingderivativescan be used to help reduce this risk.\n\nBecause the objective of these portfolios is to generate income and mitigaterisk, the returns typically are lower than those offered by portfolios with a more aggressive, higher-risk approach to investing.\n\nInvestment professionals who construct liability-driven investment portfolios must examine their firm's or client's liabilities, propose the rightasset allocation, select the appropriate investments, and monitor theportfolioscarefully, being sure to make changes when necessary.\n\nThese investments must be able to provide the income required by the liabilities as well as potential protection againstinterest rate risk, market volatility, and the risk posed byinflation. Types of liability-driven investments include:\n\nFor a retiree, a liability-driven investment\u00a0strategy starts with\u00a0estimating\u00a0the amount of income they'll need for each future year. All potential income, includingSocial Security,is deducted from the yearly amount that the retiree needs. Any shortfall equals what the retiree will have to withdraw\u00a0from their retirement portfolio annually.\n\nThe yearly withdrawals then become the liabilities that the LDI\u00a0strategy must focus on. The retiree must invest in a manner that provides the necessary cash flow, accounting for extra or unexpected spending, inflation, and other incidental expenses that may arise.\n\nThe interest in liability-driven investing took hold with urgency when more common investment strategies failed during the various financial upheavals of the early 2000s.\n\nFor an institution such as a pension fund orpension plan, the focus must be placed on investments that generate enough cash flow to satisfy liabilities, which are the payments guaranteed to retirees. The strategy must also include ways to minimize risk.\n\nSome strategies that involve mitigating risk and capturing greater returns include the following.\n\nDuration matching involves building a portfolio of assets with adurationthat aligns with the duration of the liabilities. If interest rates move in a direction that hurts the value of the assets, that can be mitigated by the effect on the liabilities. Duration matching thus can help reduce the sensitivity of the portfolio's value to changes in\u00a0interest rates.\n\nImmunization takesanother approachto duration matching, with the same goal of mitigating the effect of a change in interest rates on the value of a portfolio and on an investor's liabilities.\n\nInterest rate hedging involves the use of financial instruments such as financial futures orinterest rate swapsto safeguard the value of a portfolio from the effect of interest rate movements.\n\nFor example, an interest rate swap can exchange a fixed interest rate for a floating rate (or vice versa) to reduce a portfolio's exposure to changes ininterest rates.\n\nTo counteract the value-eroding effect of inflation, a portfolio can include investments such as inflation-linked bonds, real estate, and infrastructure. These are assets that can perform well during periods of increasing inflation and protect portfolio returns.\n\nBy including fixed-income securities such as corporate bonds and other debt securities that have a higher risk than Treasuries, investors may be able to capture higher yields.\n\nThe objective of liability-driven investments isn't necessarily a high return, but rather a return from assets that matches the financial obligations of liabilities.\n\nIf an investor needs an additional $10,000 in annual income beyond what Social Security benefits provide, they can implement an\u00a0LDI\u00a0strategy by purchasing bonds that will provide at least $10,000 in annual interest payments.\n\nAlternately, an investor can use a liability-driven investing approach that splits investment into two buckets; one, a fixed-income investment for consistent returns and the other, a higher risk equity investment. The greater returns offered by equities could be moved into the fixed income allocation over time.\n\nLiability-driven investing goes back to the day when defined-benefit pension plans were in abundance and companies had to meet their financial guarantees to the beneficiaries of those plans.\n\nIn addition to pension funds, other investors that use liability-driven investing include foundations, endowments, insurance companies, and even individual investors who want to ensure guaranteed income for their retirement and manage investment risk.\n\nEquities can be included depending on the investor'stolerance for riskbut many portfolios don't have them, due to their greater risk. The main goal of liability-driven investing is to match assets to liabilities and manage risk so that income is available to satisfy specific financial obligations. Investments that offer high returns can potentially interfere with with that goal, if their risk is too great.\n\nA liability-driven investment is an investment that can ensure that financial obligations can be met. Liability-driven investing involves matching assets, which produce cash flow, to the liabilities requiring cash.\n\nBoth pension funds and individual investors can put liability-driven investing to good use.\n\nSociety of Actuaries. \"Liability-Driven Investment Benchmark Model.\"",
