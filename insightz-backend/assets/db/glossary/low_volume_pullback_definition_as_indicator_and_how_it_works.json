  "term": "Low Volume Pullback: Definition as Indicator and How It Works",
  "definition": "A low volume pullback is atechnical correctiontoward an area of support that occurs on lower-than-average volume. Since the move occurs on low volume, traders often attribute the pullback toweak longslocking in profits rather than areversal.\n\nFrequent moves that occur in the opposite direction of atrend, which are accompanied by lowvolume, are normal fluctuations and generally deemed to be insignificant. On the other hand, a large spike in volume in the opposite direction of the trend could be used to signal that the smart money is starting to look for the exits and\u00a0the trend is getting ready to reverse. These significant moves lower are known as high volume pullbacks.\n\nMany technical traders will try to enter a position on the short-term weakness seen in alow volume pullbackbecause it increases therisk/reward ratioas stop losses are closer to majorsupport levels.\u00a0Long term investors may also take these opportunities to add to their positions at a lower price and decrease the cost basis of their overall long positions, which creates an opportunity for more upside.\n\nTraders will use indicators, such as theon-balance volume(OBV), to find situations where the trend and the volume are diverging. If the trend is moving higher and volume is decreasing, trades may look for a potentially longer-term reversal to occur since there are fewer longs responsible for pushing the stock higher. High volumepullbacksare also a sign that the market may be ready to reverse. In these instances, long traders may exit their positions and long-term investors may lock in some profits.\n\nTraders often look at many different factors when determining if a pullback is temporary or long-term. While volume is a reliable indicator, it's also important to look at chart patterns, such as key support andresistance levels, and technical indicators, like therelative strength index(RSI) ormoving average convergence-divergence(MACD), to confirm these sentiments.\n\nHere's an example of a series of low volume pullbacks in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY):\n\nThe chart shows three low volume pullbacks occurring within a significantuptrendbefore a high volume pullback that signaled a more prolonged reversal in price. Each low volume pullback was followed by a subsequent resumption of the overall trend, as weak traders took profits off the table before more bullish investors entered the market. By comparison, the high volume pullback lasted for several days and theETFwas considerably more volatile in the aftermath as investors questioned whether the long-term trend was still in place.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
