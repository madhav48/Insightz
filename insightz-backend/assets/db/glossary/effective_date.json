  "term": "Effective Date",
  "definition": "In contract law, the effective date is the date that an agreement or transaction between or among signatories becomes binding. For aninitial public offering (IPO), it is the date when shares can first be traded on an exchange.\n\nBoth parties to a contract usually need to agree on an effective date before a contract is signed.\n\nBusiness agreements and transactions are documented with effective dates, which are the times when parties to the contract begin their obligations to perform under the contract. These contracts can be in the form of employment agreements, credit or loan agreements, or commercial transaction deals. As far as the effective \"date\" is concerned, the parties will decide whether the contract should officially begin on the date of signing, on a date that has already passed (backdating), or on a future date.\n\nFor a company that wants to go public, the effective date occurs within 30 days after the security is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), giving time for the SEC to review theForm S-1registration for completeness of disclosure so that prospective investors can make informed decisions. During this review period, the SEC can ask questions, request clarifications or instruct the company to fill or amend certain sections of the filing.\n\nThe IPO process is tightly controlled by the SEC. Twilio Inc. filed for an IPO on May 26, 2016. Shortly after, the company submitted an amended filing, taking care to print on the cover page of the prospectus the following:\n\nThe effective date turned out to be June 23, 2016. Twilio's shares began trading that day.\n\nOn websites, effective dates are often found in the terms and conditions and privacy policies. Unless a company makes a special effort to create an individual agreement with a very specialized end-user or group of end-users, terms and conditions (or terms of use) and a privacy policy will apply to all users of a given website or internet platform.\n\nUsers are usually required to\u00a0accept the terms\u00a0and conditions when they download an associated app or log on to a website. Those terms should not be different from terms given to and read by any other use at any other time unless those terms are updated and all users are asked to approve the revised terms.\n\nIn such situations, the effective date for terms and conditions and privacy policy agreements is not when the user agrees to it, but\u00a0when the terms were last updated. For these types of agreements, these dates are not indicated by \u201ceffective date\u201d but \u201clast revision\u201d or \u201clast updated.\u201d",
