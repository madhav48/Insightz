  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nWeak longs are\u00a0investors who hold\u00a0alongposition and are quick to exit that position at the first sign of weakness. This type of investor is typically trying\u00a0to capture the upside potential of a security but without significant loss. These investors will quicklyclosetheir positions when a trade does not move in their favor.\n\nWeak longs are often short-term traders rather than long-terminvestorsbecause they are\u00a0unwilling to hold their positions through market fluctuations. If a trade does not move in their favor, they will quickly close their positions and look elsewhere for opportunities. Most weak longs are momentum traders who are more interested in a quick profit than investing inundervaluedcompanies until they reach a fair value.\n\nWhen weak longs close their position, it may present an opportunity for other investors tobuy into the dip. The selling pressure that weak longs create when closing their positions can lead to consolidation in a stock after a significant uptrend. This explains\u00a0why stocks tend to top out after following anearningsannouncement\u00a0because\u00a0these traders lock in their profits and move on to other investment opportunities.\n\nThe benefit of a weak long is that the investor can\u00a0secure profits immediately rather than succumbing to thedispositioneffect, holding onto a losing stock for too long. However, weak longs\u00a0tend to generate substantial\u00a0churn in their portfolio, making it harder to remain profitable such as through the use of a long-term investing strategy.\n\nWhen a company announces favorable earnings for the quarter, short-term traders may buy the stock at the open to capitalize on the run-up\u00a0while long-term investors may add the stock to their existing positions. Weak longs will hold the stock until it begins toconsolidatefollowing an earnings run-up, selling the stock and moving on to other opportunities. Long-term investors will continue holding the stock.\n\nLong-term investors may take advantage of the consolidation to add to their position and lower their cost basis. Long-term investors may wait on the sidelines following a positive earnings announcement and buy the stock after it begins to move lower and consolidate. This allows them to buy the stock at a lower price and ultimately increase their long-term profit potential.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
