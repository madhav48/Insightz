  "term": "Earnings Per Share (EPS): What It Is and How to Calculate",
  "definition": "Earnings per share (EPS) is a commonly used measure of a company's profitability. It indicates how much profit each outstanding share of common stock has earned. Generally speaking, the higher a company's EPS, the more profitable it is considered to be.\n\nEPS is calculated by dividing a company's net income by the total number of outstanding shares.\n\nEarnings per share value is calculated as net income (also known as profits or\u00a0earnings) divided by available shares. A more refined calculation adjusts the numerator and denominator for shares that could be created through options, convertible debt, or warrants. The numerator of the equation is also more relevant if it is adjusted for continuing operations.\n\nTo calculate a company's EPS, the balance sheet and income statement are used to find the period-end number of common shares, dividends paid on preferred stock (if any), and the net income or earnings.It is more accurate to use a weighted average number of common shares over the reporting term because the number of shares can change over time. Understanding how to find EPS is crucial for evaluating a company's profitability.\n\nAny stock dividends or splits that occur must be reflected in the calculation of the weighted average number ofshares outstanding. Some data sources simplify the calculation by using the number of shares outstanding at the end of a period.\n\nEarnings per share is one of the most important financial metrics employed when determining a firm's profitability on an absolute basis. It is also a major component of calculating theprice-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, where the E in P/E refers to EPS. By dividing a company's share price by its earnings per share, an investor can see thevalue of a stockin terms of how much the market is willing to pay for each dollar of earnings.\n\nEarnings per share shows an investor how to pick stocks, when used along with other indicators. If you have an interest in stock trading or investing, your next step is to choose abrokerthat works for your investment style.\n\nComparing EPS in absolute terms may not have much meaning to investors because ordinary shareholders do not have direct access to the earnings. Instead, investors will compare EPS with the share price of the stock to determine the value of earnings and how investors feel about future growth.\n\nSay that the calculation of EPS for three companies at the end of the fiscal year was as follows:\n\nTheformulain the table above calculates thebasic EPSof each of these select companies. Basic EPS does not factor in the dilutive effect of shares that could be issued by the company. When the capital structure of a company includes items such as stock options, warrants, or restricted stock units (RSU), these investments\u2014if exercised\u2014could increase the total number of shares outstanding in the market.\n\nTo better illustrate the effects of additional securities on per-share earnings, companies also report thediluted EPS, which assumes that all shares that could be outstanding have been issued.\n\nFor example, say the total number of shares that could be created and issued from Company C's convertible instruments at fiscal year-end was 23 million. If this number is added to its total shares outstanding, its diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 541 million + 23 million = 564 million shares. The company's diluted EPS is, therefore, $1.67 billion /.564 million = $2.96.\n\nSometimes an adjustment to the numerator is required when calculating a fully diluted EPS. For example, sometimes a lender will provide a loan that allows them to convert the debt into shares under certain conditions.\n\nThe shares that would be created by the convertible debt should be included in the denominator of the diluted EPS calculation, but if that happened, then the company wouldn\u2019t have paid interest on the debt. In this case, the company or analyst will add the interest paid on convertible debt back into the numerator of the EPS calculation so the result isn\u2019t distorted.\n\nEarnings per share can be distorted, both intentionally and unintentionally, by several factors. Analysts use variations of the basic EPS formula to avoid the most common ways that EPS may be inflated.\n\nImagine a company that owns two factories that make cell phone screens. The land on which one of the factories sits\u00a0has become very valuable as new developments have surrounded it over the past few years. The company\u2019s management team decides to sell the factory and build another one on less valuable land. This transaction creates a windfall profit for the firm.\n\nThough this land sale has created real profits for the company and its shareholders, it is considered an \u201cextraordinary item\u201d because there is no reason to believe the company can repeat that transaction in the future. Shareholders might be misled if the windfall is included in the numerator of the EPS equation, so it is excluded.\n\nA similar argument could be made if a company had anunusual loss\u2014maybe the factory burned down\u2014which would have temporarily decreased EPS and should be excluded for the same reason.\n\nA company started the year with 500 stores and had an EPS of $5.00. However, assume that this company closed 100 stores over that period and ended the year with 400 stores. An analyst will want to know what the EPS was for just the 400 stores the company plans to continue with into the next period.\n\nIn this example, that could increase the EPS because the 100 closed stores were perhaps operating at a loss.\u00a0By evaluating EPS from continuing operations, an analyst is better able to compare prior performance to current performance.\n\nAn important aspect of EPS that is often ignored is the capital that is required to generate the earnings (net income) in the calculation. Two companies could generate the same EPS, but one could do so with fewer net assets; that company would be more efficient at using its capital to generate income and, all other things being equal, would be a \"better\" company in terms of efficiency. A metric that can be used to identify more efficient companies is thereturn on equity(ROE).\n\nAlthough EPS is widely used as a way to track a company\u2019s performance, shareholders do not have direct access to those profits. A portion of the earnings may be distributed as a dividend, but all or a portion of the EPS can be retained by the company. Shareholders, through their representatives on theboard of directors, would have to change the portion ofEPS that is distributed through dividendsto access more of those profits.\n\nMaking a comparison of the P/E ratio within an industry group can be helpful, though in unexpected ways. Although it seems like a stock that costs more relative to its EPS when compared to peers might be \u201covervalued,\u201d the opposite tends to be the rule.\n\nRegardless of its historical EPS, investors are willing to pay more for a stock if it is expected to grow or outperform its peers. In abull market, it is normal for the stocks with the highest P/E ratios in a stock index to outperform the average of the other stocks in the index.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nRolling EPS gives an annual earnings per share (EPS) estimate by combining EPS from the past twoquarterswith estimated EPS from the next two quarters.\n\nIt may be calculated with the following formula:\n\nRolling EPS = (Net income from the previous two quarters + next two quarters \u2013 preferred dividends) / average shares outstanding\n\nEarnings per share (EPS), a company'sprofitdivided by the amount ofcommon stockit has in circulation, is one of the most closely observed metrics in investing. Other than serving as an indicator of how much money pulled in after accounting for all expenses was allotted to each share of common stock, it\u2019s also frequently used to determine if a company is reasonably valued.\n\nEPS is a key component of theprice-to-earnings(P/E) valuation ratio. Divide the share price by EPS and you get a multiple denoting how much we pay for $1 of a company\u2019s profit. In other words, if a company is currently trading at a P/E of 20x that would mean aninvestoris willing to pay $20 for $1 of current earnings.\n\nThe share price of a stock may look cheap, fairly valued or expensive, depending on whether you look at historical earnings or estimated future earnings.\n\nEarnings forecastsare based on educated guesswork fromanalystsand are often too rosy, possibly making the valuation look cheap. Historical earnings, on the other hand, are set in stone but may not fairly represent a company's legitimate growth potential. Rolling EPS represents a compromise, giving investors a blend of both.\n\nRolling EPS shouldn\u2019t be confused withtrailing EPS, which mainly uses the previous four quarters of earnings in its calculation.\n\nSometimes you may hear or spot the term rolling trailing EPS, as well. What this means is that EPS will change as the most recent earnings are added to the calculation and earnings from five quarters ago are dropped to make way for them.\n\nWhat counts as a good EPS will depend on factors such as the recent performance of the company, the performance of its competitors, and the expectations of the analysts who follow the stock. Sometimes, a company might report growing EPS, but the stock might decline in price if analysts were expecting an even higher number.\n\nLikewise, a shrinking EPS figure might nonetheless lead to a price increase if analysts were expecting an even worse result. It is important to always judge EPS in relation to the company\u2019s share price, such as by looking at the company\u2019s P/E orearnings yield.\n\nAnalysts will sometimes distinguish between basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS consists of the company\u2019s net income divided by its outstanding shares. It is the figure most commonly reported in the financial media and is also the simplest definition of EPS.\n\nDiluted EPS, on the other hand, will always be equal to or lower than basic EPS because it includes a more expansive definition of the company\u2019s shares outstanding. Specifically, it incorporates shares that are not currently outstanding but could become outstanding if stock options and other convertible securities were to be exercised.\n\nAdjusted EPS is a type of EPS calculation in which the analyst makes adjustments to the numerator. Typically, this consists of adding or removing components of net income that are deemed to be non-recurring.\n\nFor instance, if the company\u2019s net income was increased based on a one-time sale of a building, the analyst might deduct the proceeds from that sale, thereby reducing net income. In that scenario, adjusted EPS would be lower than basic EPS.\n\nWhen looking at EPS to make an investment or trading decision, be aware of some possible drawbacks. For instance, a company can game its EPS by buying back stock, reducing the number of shares outstanding, and inflating the EPS number given the same level of earnings.\n\nChanges to accounting policy for reporting earnings can also change EPS. EPS also does not take into account the price of the share, so it has little to say about whether a company's stock is over or undervalued.\n\nAfter collecting the necessary data, input the net incomeinto Excel,\u00a0preferred dividends,\u00a0and number of common shares outstanding into three adjacent cells, say B3 through B5. In cell B6, input the formula \"=B3-B4\" to subtract preferred dividends from net income. In cell B7, input the formula \"=B6/B5\" to render the EPS ratio.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) is an important profitability measure used in relating a stock's price to a company's actual earnings. In general, higher EPS is better but one has to consider the number of shares outstanding, the potential for share dilution, and earnings trends over time. If a company misses or beats analysts' consensus expectations for EPS, its shares can either crash or rally, respectively.",
