  "term": "4 Ps of Marketing: What They Are & How to Use Them Successfully",
  "definition": "Product, price, place, and promotion are the four Ps in a winning \"marketing mix\"\n\nThe four Ps or marketing are a \u201cmarketing mix\u201d comprised of four key elements\u2014product, price, place, and promotion.\n\nThese are the key factors that are involved in introducing a product or service to the public. Often referred to as amarketing mix, they provide a framework that companies can use to successfully market a product or service to consumers. Since the four Ps were introduced in the 1950s, more Ps have been added to the mix, including people, process, and physical evidence.\n\nNeil Borden, an advertising professor at Harvard, popularized the idea of the marketing mix\u2014and the concepts that would later be known primarily as the four Ps\u2014in the 1950s. His 1964 article \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix\" demonstrated the ways that companies could use advertising tactics to engage their consumers.\n\nDecades later, the concepts that Borden popularized are still being used by companies to advertise their goods and services.\n\nBorden's ideas were developed and refined over a number of years by other key players in the industry. E. Jerome McCarthy, a marketing professor at Michigan State University, refined the concepts in Borden's article and named them the \"four Ps\" of marketing. McCarthy co-wrote the bookBasic Marketing: A Managerial Approach, further popularizing the idea.\n\nAt the time the concept was introduced, it helped companies breach the physical barriers that could hamper widespread product adoption. Today, the Internet has helped businesses to overcome some of these barriers.\n\nPeople, process, and physical evidence are extensions of the original Four Ps and are relevant to current trends in marketing.\n\nAny successful marketing strategy should be revisited from time to time. The marketing mix you create is not intended to be static. It needs to be adjusted and refined as your product grows and yourcustomer base changes.\n\nCreating a marketing campaign starts with an understanding of the product itself. Who needs it and why? What does it do that no competitor's product can do? Perhaps it's a new thing altogether and is so compelling in its design or function that consumers will have to have it when they see it.\n\nThe job of the marketer is to define the product and its qualities and introduce it to the consumer\u2014the basic marketing of a product (or service).\n\nDefining the product also is key to its distribution.Marketersneed to understand thelife cycle of a product, and business executives need to have a plan for dealing with products at every stage of the life cycle.\n\nThe type of product also dictates in part how much it will cost, where it should be placed, and how it should be promoted.\n\nMany of the most successful products have been the first in their category. For example, Apple was the first to create a touchscreen smartphone that could play music, browse the internet, and make phone calls. Apple reported total sales of the iPhone for FY 2022 at $205.4 billion.In 2021, it hit the milestone of two billion iPhones sold.\n\nPrice is the amount that consumers will be willing to pay for a product. Marketers must link the price point to the product's real and perceived value, while also considering supply costs, seasonal discounts, competitors' prices, and retail markup.\n\nIn some cases, business decision-makers may raise the price of a product to give it the appearance of luxury or exclusivity. Or, they may lower the price so more consumers will try it.\n\nMarketers also need to determine when and if discounting is appropriate. A discount can draw in more customers, but it can also give the impression that the product is less desirable than it was.\n\nUNIQLO, headquartered in Japan, is a global manufacturer of casual wear. Like its competitors Gap and Zara, UNIQLO creates low-priced, fashion-forward garments for younger buyers.\n\nWhat makes UNIQLO unique is that its products are innovative and high-quality. It accomplishes this by purchasing fabric in large volumes, continually seeking the highest-quality and lowest-cost materials in the world. The company also directly negotiates with its manufacturers and has built strategic partnerships with innovative Japanese manufacturers.\n\nUNIQLO also outsources its production to partner factories. That gives it the flexibility to change production partners as its needs change.\n\nFinally, the company employs a team of skilled textile artisans that it sends to its partner factories all over the world for quality control. Production managers visit factories once a week to resolve quality problems.\n\nPlace is the consideration of where the product should be available\u2014in brick-and-mortar stores and online\u2014and how it will be displayed.\n\nThe decision is key: The makers of a luxury cosmetic product would want to be displayed in Sephora and Neiman Marcus, not in Walmart or Family Dollar. The goal of business executives is always to get their products in front of the consumers who are the most likely to buy them.\n\nThat means placing a product only in certain stores and getting it displayed to the best advantage.\n\nThe term placement also refers to advertising the product in the right media to get the attention of its target audience of consumers.\n\nFor example, the 1995 movieGoldenEyewas the 17th installment in the James Bond movie franchise and the first that did not feature an Aston Martin car. Instead, Bond actor Pierce Brosnan got into a BMW Z3. Although the Z3 was not released until months after the film had left theaters, BMW received 9,000 orders for the car the month after the movie opened.\n\nThe goal of promotion is to communicate to consumers that they need this product and that it is priced appropriately. Promotion encompasses advertising, public relations, and the overall media strategy for introducing a product.\n\nMarketers tend to tie together promotion and placement elements to reach their core audiences. For example, in the digital age, the \"place\" and \"promotion\" factors are as much online as offline. Specifically, that means where a product appears on a company's web page or social media, as well as which types of search functions will trigger targeted ads for the product.\n\nThe Swedish vodka brand Absolut sold only 10,000 cases of its vodka in 1980. By 2000, the company had sold 4.5 million cases, thanks in part to its iconic advertising campaign. The images in the campaign featured the brand's signature bottle styled as a range of surreal images: a bottle with a halo, a bottle made of stone, or a bottle in the shape of the trees standing on a ski slope. To date, the Absolut campaign is one of the longest-running continuous campaigns of all time, from 1981 to 2005.\n\nThe four Ps provide a framework on which to build your marketing strategy. Think through each factor. And don't worry when the factors overlap. That's inevitable.\n\nFirst, analyze the product you will be marketing. What are the characteristics that make it appealing? Consider similar products that are already on the market. Your product may be tougher, easier to use, more attractive, or longer-lasting. Its ingredients might be environmentally friendly or naturally sourced. Identify the qualities that will make it appealing to your target consumers.\n\nThink through the appropriate price for the product. It's not simply the cost of production plus a profit margin. You may be positioning it as a premium or luxury product or as a bare-bones, lower-priced alternative.\n\nPlacement involves identifying the type of store, online and off, that stocks products like yours for consumers like yours.\n\nYour promotion strategies can only be considered in the context of your target consumer. The product might be appealing to a hip younger crowd or to upscale professionals or to bargain hunters. Your media strategy needs to reach the right audience with the right message.\n\nTo put this into perspective, let's consider a fictional skincare company that produces organic skincare products. Here's how the four Ps might be utilized:\n\nThe 4 Ps of marketing are product, price, place, and promotion. The 4 Cs replace the Ps with consumer, cost, convenience, and communication. The 4 Cs are of more recent vintage, proposed as an alternative to the 4 Ps by Bob Lauterborn in an article inAdvertising Agein 1990. The 4 Cs are designed to be a more consumer-focused model that places more emphasis on customer needs and experience.\n\nTo better understand theconsumer(product), marketers develop detailed buyer personas of the ideal customer, with an eye toward improving communication and sales.Cost(price) is considered from the consumer point of view\u2014what customers are able and willing to pay, including for \"extras\" such as taxes and shipping costs.Communication(promotion) shifts the focus from one-way advertising to engagements with customers, especially on social media. Andconvenience(place) is all about improving the accessibility of your products, making it easier for customers to buy them.\n\nNow there is an even newer marketing mix known as the 4 Es: experience, exchange, evangelism, and everyplace. They give a nod to the importance of creating memorable experiences and emotional connections between consumers and brands.\n\nApple utilizes the four Ps of marketing by focusing on:\n\nProduct innovation: Evident in its continuous development of cutting-edge technology like the iPhone, MacBook, and Apple Watch.\n\nPricing strategy: Apple often positions its products as premium offerings, targeting a more affluent consumer base.\n\nPlace:Apple emphasizes distribution through its own retail stores, online platforms, and strategic partnerships with authorized resellers.\n\nPromotional efforts:Apple emphasizes sleek design, user experience, and aspirational branding, creating a sense of exclusivity and desirability around its products.\n\nThe model of the 4Ps can be used when you are planning a new product launch, evaluating an existing product, or trying to optimize the sales of an existing product.\n\nA careful analysis of these four factors\u2014product, price, place, and promotion\u2014helps a marketing professional devise a strategy that successfully introduces or reintroduces a product to the public.\n\nThe focus on the four Ps\u2014product, price, place, and promotion\u2014has been a core tenet of marketing since the 1950s. Three newer Ps expand the marketing mix for the 21st century.\n\nThe four Ps of marketing\u2014product, price, place, promotion\u2014are often referred to as the marketing mix. These are the key elements involved in planning and marketing a product or service, and they interact significantly with each other. Considering all of these elements is one way to approach aholistic marketing strategy.\n\nNeil Borden. \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix.\"\n\nE.
