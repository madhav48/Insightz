  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe October effect refers to the belief that stocks tend to decline during the month of October. It is considered to be more of a psychological expectation than an actual phenomenon, as most statistics contradict the theory.\n\nSome investors may be nervous during October because some large, historical market crashes occurred during this month.\n\nAlong with theSeptember effect(which also predicts weaker markets during October), actual evidence for the existence of the perceivedmarket anomalyOctober effect is not very solid.\n\nIndeed, October\u2019s 100-year stock market history has, in fact, been net positive. That's in spite of being the month of the1907 panic, Black Tuesday, Thursday, and Monday in 1929,\u00a0andBlack Monday in 1987, when the Dow plummeted 22.6% in a single day, (and remains arguably the worst single-day decline in market history on a percentage basis).\n\nProponents of the October effect, one of the most popular of the so-called calendar effects, argue that October is when some of the greatest crashes in\u00a0stock market\u00a0history occurred. These include 1929's\u00a0Black Tuesday\u00a0and Black Thursday and the 1987 stock market crash.\n\nWhile statistical evidence doesn\u2019t support the phenomenon that stocks trade lower in October, thepsychological expectationsfor the October effect still exist.\n\nTheOctober effect, however, tends to be overrated. Despite the moniker, this seeming concentration of dark market days is not statistically significant.\n\nIn fact, September historically is more often down than October.And from a historical perspective, October has marked the end of more bear markets than the beginning.\n\nThis makes October an interesting prospect forcontrarian buying. Investors who tend to see a month negatively can create opportunities for others to buy during that month. However, the end of the October effect, if it ever was a market force, may be at hand, as the month's stock market results have tended to be net positive, on average, over the past century or more.\n\nWhat is true about October is that it traditionally has been the most volatile month for stocks. According to research from LPL Financial, there are more 1% or larger swings in October in theS&P 500than in any other month in history, dating back to 1950.\n\nSome of that can be attributed to the fact that October precedes elections in early November in the U.S. every other year.\n\nSeptember, not October, has more historical down markets. However, October also has had its fair share of record stock market crashes. Some of the events over the decades that have given October the reputation for stock losses include:\n\nInterestingly, the catalysts that set off both the 1929 crash and the 1907 panic happened in September or earlier, and the market reaction to them was simply delayed.\n\nIn 1907, the panic nearly occurred in March. Throughout the year, the public\u2019s confidence intrust companiespersistently diminished. They were considered risky because of their lack of regulation. Eventually, public skepticism came to a head in October and sparked a run on the trusts.\n\nThe 1929 Crash arguably began in February, when theFederal Reservebanned margin-trading loans and cranked up interest rates.\n\nIn contrast to October effect predictions, October 2022 was one of the most positive months in U.S. stock market history, with the Dow Jones up around 12% and the S&P 500 up close to 6%.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t support the October effect. If we look at all October monthly returns going back more than a century, there simply is no data on average to support the claim that October is a losing month.\n\nNot surprisingly, some historical events have occurred in the month of October, but they most likely have remained in the collective memory because the name Black Monday sounds ominous. Markets have also crashed in months other than October.\n\nMany investors today have a better memory of thedotcomcrash and the 2008\u20132009 financial crisis, yet none of those days were given the \"black\" moniker to bear for their particular month.\n\nLehman Brothers\u2019 collapsehappened on a Monday in September and marked a major escalation in the global stakes of the financial crisis, but it didn\u2019t get reported as a new Black Monday.\n\nFor whatever reason, the news media no longer leads with black days\u2014and Wall Street doesn\u2019t seem eager to revive the practice, either.\n\nMoreover, an increasingly global pool of investors doesn\u2019t have the same historical perspective when it comes to the calendar. The end of the October effect is perhaps inevitable as, in reality, a gut feeling mixed with a few random occurrences and a media label created the myth.\n\nIn a way, this is unfortunate, as it would be ideal for investors if financial disasters, panics, and crashes occurred in just one month of the year.\n\nThe data suggest that it isn't. But some people seem to believe in it, perhaps because many of the events that happened long ago (such as the 1987 Black Monday crash) were significant at the time. Because there is a psychological bias toward predicting a negative outcome for this month, there is potential for some investors to be fearful of an October downturn.\n\nNo. Since 1928, stocks have, on average, risen in the month of October by more than 0.6%.\n\nThat depends on the time period you look at. Over the past century, September has been the worst-performing month for stocks, losing around 1% on average.\n\nThe October effect is the belief that stocks fall, on average, during the month of October. This supposed market anomaly has been cited in reflection of large market crashes that have occurred during this month, such as 1987's Black Monday.\n\nHowever, actual evidence for the October effect is scant\u2014and, in fact, October has been a net positive month, on average, going back a century. For example, October of 2022 was one of the best-performing months in recent stock market history.\n\nAs with other supposed market anomalies, the reality is that they probably don't exist, as markets do tend to be efficient (especially once anomalies are identified and publicly known). As such, one probably should not use the notion of the October effect to make trading decisions.\n\nFederal Reserve History. \u201cStock Market Crash of 1987.\u201d\n\nLibrary of Congress. \u201cThe Black Monday Stock Market Crash.\u201d\n\nStock Trader's Almanac. \"September Almanac: Worst Month of the Year Since 1950.\"\n\nLPL Research. \u201cIs October Really Scary?\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"The Panic of 1907.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Stock Market Crash of 1929.\"\n\nForbes. \"Dow On Pace For Best October Ever, Second-Best Month In 30 Years.\"\n\nYardeni Research. \"Stock Market Indicators: Historical Monthly & Annual Returns,\" Page 1.",
