This amount is not taxable and is not to be included in the taxpayer's gross income.\n\nForm 1099-INT recipients may not have to pay income tax on the interest a payer reports, but may still need to report it on their return. The IRS uses the information on the form to ensure the interest earner reports the correct amount of interest income on their tax return.\n\nForm 1099-INT has 17 boxes (in addition to the areas for the payer and recipient information).
