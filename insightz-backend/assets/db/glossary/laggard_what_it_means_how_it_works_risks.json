  "definition": "A laggard is a stock or security that is underperforming relative to its benchmark or peers. A laggard will have lower-than-average returns compared to the market. A laggard is the opposite of a leader.\n\nIn most cases, a laggard refers to a stock. The term can also, however, describe a company or individual that has been underperforming. It is often used to describe good vs. bad, as in \"leaders vs. laggards.\"\u00a0Investors want to avoid laggards, because they achieve less-than-desiredrates of return.\u00a0In\u00a0broader\u00a0terms, the\u00a0termlaggardconnotes\u00a0resistance\u00a0to progress and a persistent pattern of falling behind. As an example of a laggard, consider\u00a0stock ABC that consistently posts annual returns of only 2 percent\u00a0when other\u00a0stocks\u00a0in the industry post average returns of 5 percent.\u00a0Stock ABC would be considered a laggard.\n\nIf an investor's portfolio contains laggards, these are most likely to be sold off first. Holding astockthat returns 2 percent\u00a0instead of one that returns 5 percent\u00a0costs you 3 percent\u00a0each\u00a0year. Unless there is some solid reason to believe that a\u00a0catalyst\u00a0will\u00a0lift\u00a0shares\u00a0of a stock that has historically lagged its competition, continuing to hold the laggard costs\u00a0money.\u00a0The reason for a laggard's subpar performance is usually specific to the company. Maybe they lost a big contract. Maybe they are currently dealing with management or labor issues. Maybe their earnings are eroding in an increasingly competitive environment, and they haven't found a way to counteract the trend.\n\nHow does a stock become a laggard?\u00a0Perhaps the company continually misses earnings or sales estimates\u00a0or shows shaky fundamentals. Lower-priced stocks also carry more risk because they often feature less dollar-based trading liquidity and exhibit\u00a0bigger spreads between the bid and ask prices.\n\nEverybody loves a bargain. But when it comes to investing, a cheap or laggard stock may not be the best deal. You could very well end up getting what you paid for.\u00a0While a\u00a0stock share at\u00a0$2, $5 or $10 may seem like it has\u00a0lots of upside, most stocks selling for $10 or less are cheap for a reason. They have had some sort of deficiency\u00a0in the past, or they have something wrong with them now.\n\nA better strategy may be to to buy fewer shares of an institutional-quality stock that\u2019s rising soundly, rather than thousands of shares of a cheap stock.\u00a0Top mutual funds and other big players prefer companies with sound earnings and sales track records, and share prices of at least $15 on theNasdaqand $20 on theNYSE. They also prefer volumes to be at least\u00a0400,000 shares a day, which allows funds to make trades with less impact on the share price.",
