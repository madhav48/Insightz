  "definition": "Hinterhaus Productions / Getty Images\n\nLabor market flexibility is an important aspect of thelabor market. It allows companies to make certain decisions about changing their labor force in response to fluctuations in the market and to help boost production.\n\nOrganizations can make changes to their labor pool based on factors such as employee hiring and firing, compensation and benefits, and working hours and conditions. Companies do not have carte blanche, however, to implement a flexible labor market because oflaws and policies that protect employeesand the labor pool.\n\nLabor market flexibility refers to how quickly a firm responds to changing conditions in the market bymaking modifications to its workforce. A flexible labor market allows employers to make changes in response to supply and demand issues,the economic cycle, and other market conditions.\n\nBut a truly flexible labor market only exists when there are few labor force regulations in place. When this is the case, employers are able to set wages, fire employees, and change employee work hours at will. And the changes can go either way.\n\nDuring tough economic times, for example, an employer that has high flexibility can cut wages and increase the number of hours that employees are expected to work to boost productivity. Conversely, when the economy is strong, the same employer may decide to give employees a slight raise and cut back on their hours.\n\nLabor unions can limit labor market flexibility by negotiating higher wages, benefits, and better working conditions with employers.\n\nLess flexible labor markets are subject to more rules and regulations includingminimum wages, restrictions on firing, and other laws involving employment contracts.Labor unionsoften have considerable power in these markets.\n\nSome of the other factors that affect labor market flexibility include employee skills and training, occupational mobility, minimum wages, part-time and temporary work, and job-related information that employers make available to their employees.\n\nSupporters of increased labor market flexibility argue that it leads to lowerunemployment ratesand higher gross domestic product (GDP) due to the unintended consequences of tight labor market restrictions. A firm may consider hiring a full-time employee, for example, but be concerned that the employee would be extremely difficult to fire (should that prove necessary) and could claim costly worker's compensation or sue based on alleged unfair treatment. The firm may choose instead to take on short-term contract workers.\n\nSuch a system benefits the relatively small number of full-time employees with especially secure positions, but hurts those on the outside\u2014those who must move between unreliable,short-term gigs.\n\nProponents of tough labor market regulations, on the other hand, claim that flexibility puts all the power in the hands of the employer, resulting in an insecure workforce. The labor movement began in the late 18th and 19th centuries in the U.S. and Europe in response to dangerous and dirty workplace conditions, extremely long shifts, exploitative practices by management and owners\u2014wage garnishment, threats, and other abuse\u2014and arbitrary dismissals.\n\nEmployers had little incentive to ensure that workplace injuries and deaths were rare, since they faced no consequences for creating hazardous conditions, and employees who could no longer work were easy to replace.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, unions, employee skills and training, minimum wage regulations, and job-related information can all have an impact on flexibility in the labor market.\n\nAlso called trade unions, these organizations represent the collective interests of a group of workers. Employeescan band together through their unionto initiate negotiations for better wages, working conditions, benefits, and working hours, making the market less flexible.\n\nWhen employees are skilled and have ready access to training to improve on or add to their skills, they are better able to respond to changes in the market. For example, a customer service representative who goes back to school to get training in the information technology (IT) sector is able to respond to the growing demand for IT technicians when vacancies arise.\n\nState and federal regulations limit how low employers can set the base pay per hour for employees. These minimums are based on changes in the cost of living and inflation.Some employers feelhigher minimum wagescut into their productivity as well as their bottom line.\n\nPeople rely on the information provided by employers about the jobs available in the market. Themore informed job seekersare about open positions, the easier it is for employees to respond to fluctuating conditions within a company's workforce and in the market, making it much more flexible.\n\nWays to make labor markets more flexible include reducing or abolishing the minimum wage, reducing the power of labor unions, providing education and skills training to workers to improve mobility, making it easier to lay off workers, removing labor protection laws, and reducing unemployment.\n\nLabor is generally categorized into unskilled, semi-skilled, and skilled. Unskilled labor is that which does not require any skill or education and that can be performed by almost anyone. Unskilled labor tends to focus on physical labor as opposed to mental labor. Semi-skilled labor requires some skills and education but not as much as skilled labor. Skilled labor requires extensive education, such as a college degree, with jobs that are in need of judgment, decision-making, and complex thought.\n\nThe labor market is where employees and jobs interact whereas the financial market involves saving, borrowing, and investing.\n\nDuke University, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences. \"Social Movements: Labor Movements.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Minimum Wage.\"",
