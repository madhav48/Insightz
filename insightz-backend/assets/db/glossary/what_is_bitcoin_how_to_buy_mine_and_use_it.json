  "term": "What Is Bitcoin? How To Buy, Mine, and Use It",
  "definition": "Bitcoin (BTC) is a cryptocurrency (a virtual currency) designed to act as money and a form of payment outside the control of any one person, group, or entity. This removes the need for trusted third-party involvement (e.g., a mint or bank) in financial transactions.\n\nBitcoin was introduced to the public in 2008 by an anonymous developer or group of developers using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It has since become themost well-known and largest cryptocurrencyin the world. Its popularity has inspired the development of many other cryptocurrencies.\n\nRead on to learn more about thecryptocurrencythat started it all\u2014the history behind it, how to buy it, mine it, and what it can be used for.\n\nIn August 2008, the domain name Bitcoin.org was\u00a0registered. It was created bySatoshi Nakamotoand Martti Malmi, who worked with the anonymous Nakamoto to develop Bitcoin.\n\nIn October 2008, Nakamoto\u00a0announced to the cryptography mailing list at metzdowd.com: \"I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party.\"\u00a0The now-famous white paper published on Bitcoin.org, entitled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" would become the Magna Carta for how Bitcoin operates today.\n\nOn Jan. 3, 2009, the first Bitcoin block wasmined. Called Block 0, it is also known as thegenesis blockand contains the text: \"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,\" perhaps proof that the block was mined on or after that date.\n\nBitcoin rewards arehalvedevery 210,000 blocks. For example, the block reward was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third halving occurred, bringing the reward for each block down to 6.25 bitcoins. The fourth halving occurred in April 2024 and lowered the reward to 3.125 bitcoins. The next halving should happen in mid-2028 and reduce the reward to 1.5625 BTC.\n\nOne bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places (100 millionths of one bitcoin), and this smallest unit is referred to as a satoshi.\n\nOn Jan. 8, 2009, the first version of the\u00a0Bitcoin\u00a0software was\u00a0announced\u00a0to the Cryptography Mailing List, and on Jan. 9, 2009, Block 1\u00a0was mined, and\u00a0Bitcoin mining began.\n\nBitcoin as a form of digital currency isn't hard to understand. For example, if you own a bitcoin, you can use your cryptocurrency wallet to send smaller portions of that bitcoin as payment for goods or services. By contrast, the way Bitcoinactually worksis very complex.\n\nA blockchain is a distributed ledger, a shared database of information that is chained together via cryptographic techniques. \"Distributed\" means that it is stored on many computers rather than a centralized server location, as is typical of most data storage.\n\nA network of automated programs installed on these computers maintains the blockchain and performs the functions necessary for it to operate.\n\nA block on ablockchainis a file that contains a block header, transaction counter, and the transactions recorded in the block. The transaction counter lists the transactions in the block, while the block header is made up of several elements:\n\nAs noted, each block contains the hashed information of the previous block. This creates a chain of encrypted blocks (files) that contain information from all previous blocks, going back to the first block of the blockchain.\n\nBitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm to encrypt (hash) the data stored in the blocks on the blockchain. Simply put, transaction data stored in a block is encrypted into a 256-bit (64-digit) hexadecimal number. That number contains all the transaction data and information linked to the blocks before that block.\n\nWhile the data in a block is encrypted and used in the next block, the block is not inaccessible or non-readable. The hash is used in the next block, then its hash is used in the next, and so on, but all blocks can be read. This ensures that blocks cannot be changed without changing all other blocks and ensures anyone can audit the blockchain.\n\nIf you don't want to mine Bitcoin, you can buy it using a cryptocurrency exchange. Most people will be unable to purchase an entire BTC because of its price, but you can buy portions of one BTC on these exchanges in fiat currency, such as U.S. dollars.\n\nFor example, you can buy a bitcoin onCoinbaseby creating and funding an account using your bank account, credit card, or debit card. The following video explains more about buying a bitcoin.\n\nA variety of hardware and software can be used to mine Bitcoin. When the Bitcoin blockchain was first released, it was possible to mine it competitively on a personal computer. However, as it became more popular, more miners joined the network, which lowered the chances of being the one to solve the hash.\n\nYou can still use your personal computer as a miner if it has newer hardware, but the chances of solving ahashindividually using a home computer are minuscule.\n\nThis is because you're competing with a network of miners that generate around 745 quintillion hashes (as of Dec. 5, 2024) per second. Machines\u2014called Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) built specifically for mining\u2014can generate more than 400 trillion hashes per second. In contrast, a computer with the latest hardware hashes around 100 megahashes per second (100 million).\n\nThere are two hardware options available for Bitcoin mining and several software options.\n\n1.You can use your existing computer and mining software compatible with Bitcoin software and join a mining pool. Mining pools are groups of miners that combine their computational power to compete with large ASIC mining farms.\n\nThere aremany mining programsto choose from and pools you can join. Two of the most well-known programs are CGMiner and BFGMiner. Some of the most popular pools are Foundry Digital, Antpool, F2Pool, ViaBTC, and Binance.com.\n\n2.If you have the financial means, you could purchase an ASIC miner. You can generally find a new one for around $10,000, but used ones are also sold by miners as they upgrade their systems. There are some significant costs, such as electricity and cooling, to consider if you purchase one or more ASICs. Keep in mind using one or two ASICs is still no guarantee of rewards as you're competing with businesses with large mining farms of tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of ASICs. For example, Bitcoin mining firm CleanSpark claims to have 195,059 miners deployed.\n\nYou can increase your chances of being rewarded bitcoins by joining a pool, but rewards are significantly decreased because they are shared. Whenchoosing a pool, it's important to make sure to find out how it pays out rewards, what any fees might be, and to read some mining pool reviews.\n\nBitcoin was initially designed and released as a peer-to-peer payment method. However, its use cases are growing due to its increasing value, competition from other blockchains and cryptocurrencies, and developments on blockchains that process information for the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nBitcoin is accepted as a means of payment forgoods and servicesat many merchants, retailers, and stores.\n\nBrick-and-mortar stores that accept cryptocurrencies will generally display a sign that says \"Bitcoin Accepted Here.\" The transactions can be handled with the requisite hardware terminal or wallet address through QR codes and touchscreen apps. An online business can easily accept bitcoin by adding this payment option to its other online payment options: credit cards, PayPal, etc.\n\nTo use your bitcoin, you need to have a cryptocurrency wallet. Wallets are your blockchain interface and can hold the private keys to the bitcoins that you own. These keys must be entered when you're conducting a transaction.\n\nInvestors and speculators became interested in Bitcoin as it grew in popularity. Between 2009 and 2017, cryptocurrency exchanges emerged that facilitated Bitcoin sales and purchases. Prices began to rise, and demand slowly grew until 2017, when its price broke $1,000.\n\nMany people believed Bitcoin prices would keep climbing and began buyingit as long-term investments.Tradersbegan using cryptocurrency exchanges to make short-term trades, and the market took off.\n\nAfter reaching about $69,000 in November 2021, Bitcoin's price crashed in 2022. In March 2022, it was as high as $47,454, but by November, it was $15,731. It then recovered in 2023, seeing a price as high as $31,474 before dropping back below $30,000.\n\nIn early 2024, Bitcoin's price jumped into the mid $40,000s as expectations grew for Bitcoin Spot ETFs' approval. By mid-February 2024, after the ETFs were approved, Bitcoin's price climbed to more than $50,000.\n\nFollowing an increase in optimism and price after Donald Trump was re-elected in November 2024, Bitcoin breached $100,000 for the first time on Dec. 5, 2024, after years of arguments for and against its ability to do so by investors and analysts.\n\nBitcoin prices tend to follow stock market trends because Bitcoin is treated the same way that investors treat other investments. However, Bitcoin price movements are greatly exaggerated and sometimes are prone to movements of thousands of dollars. Many Bitcoin investors tend to \"trade the news,\" as demonstrated by the fluctuations that occur whenever there is a significant news event.\n\nBitcoin had a price of $7,167.52 on Dec. 31, 2019, and a year later, it had appreciated more than 300% to $28,984.98. It continued to surge in the first half of 2021, trading at a record high of $69,000 in November 2021. It then fell over the next few months to hover around $40,000 and rose with increasing speed in 2024 to more than $100,000.\n\nAs a result of such price movements, many people purchase Bitcoin for its investment value rather than its ability to act as amedium of exchange. However, the lack of guaranteed value and its digital nature means its purchase and use carry several inherent risks.\n\nIn fact, many investor alerts issued by theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), theFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and theConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)concern Bitcoin investing.\n\nHere are some of the risks that you're exposed to when trading or investing in Bitcoin:\n\nAs with any new technology, it has been difficult to regulate Bitcoin. The U.S. administration seeks to impose regulations on cryptocurrency but, at the same time, walks a tightrope in trying not to throttle a growing and economically beneficial industry.\n\nEnforcement agencies in the U.S. continue to rely on existing securities, commodities, and tax laws, but as of December 2024, no attempts from legislators have gained much attention from the country's law-making bodies.\n\nThe European Commission's long-anticipated Markets in Crypto Assets legislation came into force in 2023, setting the stage for cryptocurrency regulations in the European Union.\n\nIndia banned several exchanges in December 2023 and continues to push back reviews of any legislation regarding Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\nBitcoin is a decentralized digital currency. It uses blockchain, which is a distributed ledger secured by cryptographic techniques.\n\nInvesting in Bitcoin is very risky, but there is also the possibility of high returns. Prices can move by thousands of dollars per day, and long-term outlooks for the cryptocurrency vary.\n\nYes. Bitcoin is a convertible currency that can be exchanged for most fiat currencies.\n\nAn amount of Bitcoin worth $1 is worth $1 in U.S. dollars. The value of 1 BTC in U.S. dollars varies by the minute, but on Dec. 5, 2024, it was more than $100,000.\n\nBitcoin was the first cryptocurrency introduced to the public and was intended to be used as a form of payment outside of legal tender. Since its introduction in 2009, Bitcoin's popularity has surged, and its blockchain uses have expanded.\n\nThough the process of generating Bitcoin is complex, investing in it is more straightforward. Investors and speculators can buy and sell Bitcoin oncrypto exchanges. As with any investment, particularly one as new and volatile as Bitcoin, investors should carefully consider if Bitcoin is the right investment for them.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
