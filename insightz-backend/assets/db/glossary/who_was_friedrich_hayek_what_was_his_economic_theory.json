Hayek's approach mostly stems from theAustrian schoolof economics and emphasizes the limited nature of knowledge. He is particularly famous for his defense offree-marketcapitalism and is remembered as one of the greatest critics of the socialist consensus.\n\nFriedrich Hayek was born in Vienna, Austria, on May 8, 1899. He attended the University of Austria where he obtained doctorates in both law and political science in 1921 and 1923, respectively. He also completed postgraduate work at New York University in 1924.\n\nHayek founded the Austrian Institute for Business Cycle Research and served as its director from 1927 to 1931. In 1931, he left to join the London School of Economics (LSE) as the Tooke Professor of Economic Science and Statistics until 1950. After LSE, he took a position at the University of Chicago as the Professor of Social and Moral Science up until 1962. From 1962 to 1968 he was a professor at the University of Freiburg.\n\nA World War I veteran, Hayek later said\u00a0his experience in the war and his desire to help avoid the mistakes that ignited the war drew him into economics. Hayek lived in Austria, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany and became a British subject in 1938.\n\nFriedrich Hayek andGunnar Myrdaleach won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences in 1974 \"for their pioneering work in the theory of money and economic fluctuations and their penetrating analysis of the interdependence of economic, social, and institutional phenomena.\"\n\nOne of Hayek's key achievements was his bookThe Road to Serfdom, which he wrote out of concern for\u00a0the general view in British\u00a0academia that fascism was a capitalist reaction tosocialism. It was written between 1940 and 1943. The title was inspired by the French classical liberal thinker\u00a0Alexis de Tocqueville's writings on the \"road to servitude.\"\n\nThe Austrian school of economics was first developed in the late 19th century and focuses on the idea of using logic to discover economic laws.\n\nThe book\u00a0was quite popular and\u00a0was published in the United States by the University of Chicago in 1944, which propelled it to even\u00a0greater popularity than in Britain.\u00a0At the instigation of editor\u00a0Max Eastman, the American magazineReader's Digestalso published an abridged version in April 1945, enablingThe Road to Serfdomto reach a far wider audience than academics.\n\nThe book is widely popular among those advocating\u00a0individualism\u00a0and\u00a0classical liberalism.\n\nOther published works by Hayek includeIndividualism and Economic Order,John Stuart Mill and Harriet Taylor,The Pure Theory of Capital, andThe Sensory Order.\n\nIn 1984, Hayek\u00a0was appointed a member of the\u00a0Order of the Companions of Honour\u00a0by\u00a0Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0on the advice of Prime Minister\u00a0Margaret Thatcher,\u00a0for his \"services to the study of economics.\"\u00a0He was the first recipient of the\u00a0Hanns Martin Schleyer Prize\u00a0in 1984.\u00a0He also received the U.S.\u00a0Presidential Medal of Freedom\u00a0in 1991 from President\u00a0George H. W. Bush.\n\nFriedrich Hayek won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on the theory of money and economic fluctuations. He won it in 1974 with Gunnar Myrdal.\n\nFriedrich Hayek had many beliefs in relation to economics. He was part of the Austrian School of Economics and believed in free-market capitalism. He also believed that free markets allowed for creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurship, which are necessary for societies to bloom and citizens to prosper.\n\nFriedrich Hayek was a defender of free-market capitalism and spoke out against many of the economic norms of the 20th century, such as Keynesian economics and socialism.\n\nHayek is considered a\u00a0major social theorist and political philosopher of the 20th\u00a0century. His theory on\u00a0how\u00a0changing prices relay\u00a0information\u00a0that helps people\u00a0determine their plans is widely regarded as an important milestone achievement\u00a0in economics.
