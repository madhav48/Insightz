  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA technical analyst, also known as achartistor market technician, is a securities researcher or trader who analyzes investments based on past market prices andtechnical indicators.\n\nTechnicians believe that short-term price movements are the result ofsupply and demand forcesin the market for a given security. Thus, for technicians, thefundamentalsof the security are less relevant than the current balance of buyers and sellers. Based on the careful interpretation of past trading patterns, technical analysts try to discern this balance with the aim of predicting future price movements.\n\nTechnical analysisis a trading discipline employed to evaluate\u00a0investments and identify trading opportunities. It involves analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such asprice movement and volume.\n\nUnlikefundamental analysts, who\u00a0attempt to evaluate a security'sintrinsic value,\u00a0technical analysts\u00a0focus on patterns of price movements, trading signals, and various other analytical charting tools to evaluate a security's strength or weakness. Technical analysis utilizes price movements and chart histories to uncover trends and sentiment based on revealed market psychology.\n\nTechnical analysts have developed an extensive toolbox ofanalysis techniques and indicators.\u00a0Typically, the use of one technical indicator does not provide enough information to make a trading decision; technicians use several\u00a0indicators to confirm a hypothesis before taking action. There is no broad consensus on the best method of identifying future price movements, so most technicians gradually develop their own set of trading rules based on their knowledge and experience.\n\nTechnical analysts can work in eitherbuy-side or sell-sidefirms and, as of 2022, earn an average income of $108,080.\n\nTechnical analysts rely on technical analysis trading systems, which form the basis for their investment trades. Since many technical analysts areday traders, these systems are typically targeted at individual traders.\n\nChartists have a variety of options to choose from with many programs available through brokerages. Brokerages will often include comprehensive charting software with featured charting patterns in their service offering. Many advanced chartists, however, choose to obtain charting software from independent vendors in order to have access to the full range of available charting patterns.\n\nLicensing is required for most technical analysts, although it will depend on the specific duties they perform, the organization they work for, and the state in which they reside. TheFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA) issues licenses to technicians who are sponsored by the firm that employs them.\n\nMany technical analysts hold certifications from industry-recognized professional associations, such as the CFA Institute. To earn theChartered Financial Analystdesignation from the institute, technical analysts must have relevant work experience and pass several exams. Other prominent associations that technical analysts may belong to include the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts and the International Federation of Technical Analysts.\n\nTheChartered Market Technician(CMT) designation marks the highest level of training within the discipline and is the preeminent designation for practitioners worldwide. It is issued by the CMT Association (formerly theMTA), a global credentialing body with nearly 50 years of service to the financial industry.\n\nTechnical analysis provides the tools to successfully navigate the gap between\u00a0intrinsic value\u00a0and market price across all asset classes through a disciplined, systematic approach to market behavior and the law of supply and demand. Earning the CMT demonstrates mastery of a core body of knowledge of investment risk in portfolio management, including quantitative approaches to market research and rules-based trading system design and testing.\n\nA technical analyst observes and interprets the price action of a security to make predictions about its future direction. They apply this price\u00a0data to statistical formulas to determine probable outcomes.\n\nTechnicians may present their findings both internally and externally. For example, a technical analyst may present severaltactical tradingideas at their investment firm\u2019s morning meeting as well as give a presentation at a client seminar.\n\nTechnical analysts may also work closely with fundamental analysts to compile research reports that provide comprehensive analysis for stocks that a brokerage firm covers.\n\nGlassdoor. \"Technical Analyst Salaries.\"",
