  "term": "Oscillator: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "An oscillator is atechnical analysistool that constructs high and low bands between two extreme values and then builds a trend indicator that fluctuates within these bounds. Traders use the trend indicator to discover short-termoverbought or oversold conditions.\n\nWhen the value of the oscillator approaches the upper extreme value, technical analysts interpret that information to mean that the asset is overbought, and as it approaches the lower extreme, technicians consider the asset to be oversold.\n\nOscillators are typically used in conjunction with other technical analysis indicators to make trading decisions. Analysts find oscillators most advantageous when they cannot find a clear trend in a company\u2019s stock price easily\u2014for example, when a stock trades horizontally or sideways. The most common oscillators are the:\n\nIn technical analysis, investors find oscillators to be one of the most important technical tools to understand, but there are also other technical tools that analysts find helpful in enhancing their trading, such as chart reading skills andtechnical indicators.\n\nIf aninvestor uses an oscillator, they first pick two values; then, placing the tool between the two, the oscillator oscillates, creating a trend indicator. Investors then use the trend indicator to read current market conditions for that particular asset. When the investor sees that the oscillator moves toward a higher value, the investor reads the asset asoverbought. In the opposite scenario, when the oscillator trends toward the lower value, the investors consider the assetoversold.\n\nIn technical analysis, an investor measures oscillators on a percentage scale from 0 to 100, where the closing price is relative to the total price range for a specified number of bars in a given bar chart. To achieve this, one deploys various techniques of manipulating andsmoothing out multiple moving averages.\n\nWhen the market trades in a specific range, the oscillator follows the price fluctuations and indicates an overbought condition when it exceeds 70 to 80% of the specified total price range, signifying a selling opportunity. An oversold condition exists when the oscillator falls below 30 to 20%, which signifies a buying opportunity.\n\nThe signals remain valid as long as the price of the underlying security remains in the established range. However, when a price breakout occurs,the signals may be misleading. Analysts consider a price breakout either the resetting of the range\u00a0by\u00a0which the current sideways market is bound\u00a0or the beginning of a new trend. During theprice breakout, the oscillator may\u00a0remain in the overbought or oversold range for an extended period of time.\n\nTechnical analysts consider oscillators better suited forsideways marketsand consider them more effective when used in conjunction with a technical indicator that identifies the market as being in a trend or range-bound. For example, a moving averagecrossoverindicator can be used to determine if a market is, or is not, in a trend. Once the analysts determine that the market is not in a trend,the signals of an oscillatorbecome much more useful and effective.",
