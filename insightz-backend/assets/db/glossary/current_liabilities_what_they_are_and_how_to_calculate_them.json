  "term": "Current Liabilities: What They Are and How to Calculate Them",
  "definition": "Current liabilities are a company\u2019s short-term financial obligations that are due within one year or within a normal operating cycle.\u00a0An operating cycle, also referred to as thecash conversion cycle, is the time it takes a company to purchase inventory and convert it to cash from sales. An example of a current liability is money owed to suppliers in the form ofaccounts payable.\n\nCurrent liabilities are typically settled usingcurrent assets, which are assets that are used up within one year. Current assets include cash oraccounts receivable, which is money owed by customers for sales. The ratio ofcurrent assets to current liabilitiesis important in determining a company\u2019s ongoing ability to pay its debts as they are due.\n\nAccounts payable is typically one of the largest current liability accounts on a company\u2019s financial statements, and it represents unpaid supplier invoices. Companies try to match payment dates so that their accounts receivable are collected before the accounts payable are due to suppliers.\n\nFor example, a company might have 60-day terms for money owed to their supplier, which results in requiring their customers to pay within a 30-day term. Current liabilities can also be settled by creating a new current liability, such as a new short-term debt obligation.\n\nCompanies will include liabilities on their balance sheet. Some businesses will use acommon size balance sheetthat shows numeric values and the relative percentage of the liability. Below is a list of the most common current liabilities that are found on the balance sheet:\n\nSometimes, companies use an account calledother current liabilitiesas a catch-all line item on their balance sheets to include all other liabilities due within a year that are not classified elsewhere. Current liability accounts can vary by industry or according to various government regulations.\n\nAnalysts and creditors often use thecurrent ratio. The current ratio measures a company\u2019s ability to pay its short-term financial debts or obligations. The ratio, which is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities, shows how well a company manages its balance sheet to pay off its short-term debts and payables. It shows investors and analysts whether a company has enough current assets\u00a0on its balance sheet to satisfy or pay off its current debt and other payables.\n\nThequick ratiois the same formula as the current ratio, except that it subtracts the value of total inventories beforehand. The quick ratio is a more conservative measure forliquiditysince it only includes the current assets that canquicklybe converted to cash to pay off current liabilities.\n\nA number higher than one is ideal for both the current and quick ratios, since it demonstrates that there are more current assets to pay current short-term debts. However, if the number is too high, it could mean the company is notleveragingits assets as well as it otherwise could be.\n\nAlthough the current and quick ratios show how well a company converts its current assets to pay current liabilities, it\u2019s critical to compare the ratios to companies within the same industry.\n\nThe analysis of current liabilities is important to investors and creditors. Banks, for example, want to know before extending credit whether a company is collecting\u2014or getting paid\u2014for its accounts receivable in a timely manner. On the other hand, on-time payment of the company\u2019s payables is important as well. Both the current and quick ratios help with the analysis of a company\u2019s financialsolvencyand management of its current liabilities.\n\nWhen a company determines that it received an economic benefit that must be paid within a year, it must immediately record a credit entry for a current liability. Depending on the nature of the received benefit, the company\u2019s accountants classify it as either anassetorexpense, which will receive the debit entry.\n\nFor example, a large car manufacturer receives a shipment of exhaust systems from its vendors, to whom it must pay $10 million within the next 90 days. Because these materials are not immediately placed into production, the company\u2019s accountants record a credit entry to accounts payable and a debit entry toinventory, an asset account, for $10 million. When the company pays its balance due to suppliers, it debits accounts payable and credits cash for $10 million.\n\nSuppose a company receives tax preparation services from its external auditor, to whom it must pay $1 million within the next 60 days. The company\u2019s accountants record a $1 million debit entry to the audit expense account and a $1 million credit entry to the other current liabilities account. When a payment of $1 million is made, the company\u2019s accountant makes a $1 million debit entry to the other current liabilities account and a $1 million credit to the cash account.\n\nBelow is a current liabilities example using the consolidated balance sheet of Macy\u2019s Inc.
