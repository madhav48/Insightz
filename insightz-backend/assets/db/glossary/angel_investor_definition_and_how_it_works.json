  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn angel investor is an early-stage investor in astartup. These investors provide seed money, usually in exchange for ownership equity in the company.\n\nAn angel investor provides initial seed money forstartupbusinesses, usually in exchange for ownership equity in the company.\n\nProfessional angel investors may be involved in multiple start-up projects at once. Other times, entrepreneurs and founders will find angel investors among theirfamily and friends. The investor\u2019s involvement may be a one-time infusion of seed money, or they may provide regular injections of cash designed to bring a product to market.\n\nAngel investors aren\u2019t providing loans. They\u2019re putting money into an idea they like, with the expectation of a reward only if and when the business takes off.\n\nThe term \u201cangel investor\u201d originated in the Broadway theatrical world, where plays were often financed by wealthy individuals rather than formal lenders, and payments were due only when and if the production was a success.It has since come to be used for investors in startup ideas.\n\nMost angel investors are relatively wealthy individuals who are looking for a higher rate of return than can be found in more traditional investment opportunities. They search for startups with intriguing ideas and invest their own money to help develop them further.\n\nThese ventures are, by nature, extremely risky because the ideas being invested in are unproven in the market. A survey by the Angel Capital Association estimated that only 11% of such ventures end with a positive result. Their investments in each venture are relatively modest, averaging about $42,000 for investors with more experience and $25,000 for investors with less experience.\n\nMost angels keep their involvement in startups to a small percentage of theirportfolios. More experienced investors averaged 15%, while less experienced investors averaged only 7%.\n\nAngel investors connect with startups in need of cash through a variety of paths, including:\n\nIf a business is successful, the payoff for angel investors can be highly lucrative. In 2021, the average return on investment was 2.7x for companies that were still operating when the investor exited the partnership.\n\nAn entrepreneur may seek an angel investor over more conventional financing such as business loans. The terms tend to be more favorable, especially because the angel investor doesn\u2019t expect to get the money back unless the idea succeeds. Unlike a loan that must be repaid with interest, angel investors focus on helping startups take their first steps. In return, they generally seekan equity stakeand a seat on the board.\n\nAngel investors are also called:\n\nAnyone who has the money and the desire to provide funding for startups can be an angel investor. They are welcomed by cash-hungry entrepreneurs who can\u2019t get conventional bank loans or don\u2019t want the burden of big debt until their ideas take off.\n\nAngel investors have a genuine interest in innovation and a desire to be involved. Many have been entrepreneurs in the past. They usually are using their own money, unlike venture capitalists, who pool money from many investors.\n\nThough angel investors are usually individuals, the entity that actually provides the funds may be alimited liability company (LLC), a business, a trust, or aninvestment fund. These are vehicles that the investor sets up for tax purposes or legal protection.\n\nAngel investors whoseedstartups that fail during their early stages lose their entire investments. This is why professional angel investors look for opportunities that have one of three things:\n\nAngel investors can obtainaccredited investorstatus, although this isn\u2019t a prerequisite. Accredited investor status is a formal designation, regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), that gives individuals access to the private capital markets based on their assets and financial acumen.\n\nThe SEC defines an accredited investor as an individual who has anet worthof $1 million or more in assets or has earned $200,000 in income for the previous two years, or a couple with a combined income of $300,000. Applicants must also demonstrate an understanding of sophisticated investment proposals.\n\nAngel investing is often associated with the tech industry, with investment mainstays including fintech, enterprise software, and hardware. However, by 2021, businesses in the areas of health and life sciences began to overtake traditional tech investments. In 2021, one-third of reported angel investments were made in life sciences businesses, while the remaining two-thirds were in other areas.However, any type of business may attract angel investors if the founder can demonstrate a solid business plan and potential for success in the market.\n\nVenture capitalistsdeploy vast sums of cash pooled from many investors. They have big money to spend and tend to spend it only on existing businesses that they think have an opportunity to turn a substantially bigger profit. For example, they might buy a moribund retail chain with the goal of revitalizing it over the next two years.\n\nAngel investors are individuals who put money into good ideas at their earliest stages of becoming successful businesses. They are committing their own money in hopes of making a good idea a reality.\n\nThe entrepreneur is giving up a share of the company and its future profits in return for angel investing. Many angel investors want some control over the development of the product as well. They often want a seat on the board or its equivalent.\n\nAngel investing has grown over the past few decades into a primary source of funding for many entrepreneurs in the early planning stages of turning their ideas into businesses. This, in turn, has fostered innovation that translates into economic growth.\n\nFor the entrepreneur, an angel investor provides a much-needed lifeline that is not available through more conventional funding sources. For the angel investor, involvement in early-stage startups has big risks but the potential for big rewards, including personal participation in an innovative project.\n\nCorporate Finance Institute. \u201cAngel Investor.\u201d\n\nAngel Capital Association. \u201cThe American Angel,\u201d Pages 3-4.\n\nAngel Capital Association. \"Angel Funders Report 2022.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cAccredited Investor.\u201d",
