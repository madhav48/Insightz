  "term": "Roll Back: Meaning, Pros and Cons, Example",
  "definition": "A roll back, or roll backward, refers to a derivatives trading strategy that replaces an existing position with a new one that has a nearer expiration date. Aside from the contract's expiration date, other details are often not changed. For instance, a trader may roll back a September at-the-money call position to a June position with the same strike price.\n\nTraders use this strategy to cut out market risk and volatility in the short or long term. Option roll strategies, sometimes calledjelly rolls, can take various forms including roll back,roll forward,roll up, androll down.\n\nA roll back is one of manyoptionstrading strategies available to traders and one of many that is labeled as a roll. A roll back may also be called a roll backward. This strategy rolls from one options position to a new one with a more near-termexpiration date.\n\nThe roll back component of thetransactionrequires that the expiration month be closer than the previous position. Other aspects of the contract, primarily thestrike price, can change or stay the same.\n\nMost roll backs occur as either all puts or all calls. But a trader could potentially switch from one to the other. In all types of roll backs, the option owner sells their options contract in the openmarketto close the position, then uses the proceeds to roll into the new, shorter-term position.\n\nA roll back is used to increase the long or shortgammaexposure in an options position, where an option's gamma is its sensitivity in itsdeltato changes in the underlying price. A trader would want to increase a long gamma position if they believe the underlying will be quitevolatilein the near term, while they would prefer to increase a short gamma position if they believe that the underlying price will remain constant and stable.\n\nGamma is the rate of change between an option's\u00a0delta\u00a0and the underlying asset's price. The option's delta is the rate of change\u00a0between its price and a $1 change in the\u00a0underlying asset's\u00a0price.\n\nTraders use a roll back to take advantage of changing market conditions or to revise positions that they no longer see asprofitable.Callpositions rolled back with higher strike prices are also considered a roll up or a roll back and up.Call positions rolled back with a lower strike price are considered a roll down or a roll back and down. Options with the same strike are just considered a roll back and focus only on the expiration date.\n\nAputroll back will roll one put to another with a closer expiration. The trader can use the proceeds from the sale to buy a new put contract with a selling strike price that is higher, lower, or the same as the previous position. Changing the strike price would also incorporate a roll up or roll down. With a put roll back, theinvestorbelieves there will be greater profit from the contract in the near term.\n\nHere are a couple of examples to show how the roll back process works with both a call and a put. Remember, a call gives a trader the right (but not the obligation) to purchase a security by a specific date at a specific price while a put gives the owner the right (but not the obligation) to sell the security by a specific date at a specific price.\n\nLet's say a trader has an October 50 call and wants to execute a roll back. They do so by swapping it out for a September 50 call. This trader may believe that the former October call is no longer worth owning and the September call is a better bet. If the investor isbearishon the stock, they may do a roll back and down with a September 45.\n\nHere's how it works with a put. Let's say this trader purchases the September 50 contract and decides that they'd be better off selling this contract for one with a closer expiration date. They use the proceeds from the sale of the contract to purchase one at the same position for the month of August.\n\nAs mentioned above, options contracts are a hedge against risk and volatility. Traders can take advantage of rolling back on their options contracts in order to reducemarket risk, which can put the investor's entire investment in jeopardy.\n\nBy cutting back on the risks, roll backs also allow traders to cut down on losses and lock in their profits. That's because this strategy gives them the option to agree on afixed pricefor the underlying security with the other party to be purchased or sold by a specified date.\n\nTraders can also save on transaction costs. Trading options contracts, including the execution of roll backs, means the trader puts down a lower cost at the onset of the contract (includingcommissions) rather than purchasing the underlying security individually. And commissions are generally lower, as traders may have to pay one fee to swap out contracts.\n\nOptions trading of any kind requires a lot of experience. You need to have a good understanding of all the risks involved and the potential for losses that may come your way. In short, this kind oftradingisn't for novice investors. As such, the firm you work with\u2014the one that handles your accounts\u2014will need to ensure you are experienced enough to execute these trades and strategies, including roll backs.\n\nSpeculationplays a big part in options trading. Traders use a variety of techniques to map out which direction their investments will head toward, which means it's never an exact science. You do risk boosting your losses as you try to chase profits if your strategy doesn't work out.\n\nYour brokerage or financial firm may want you to set up amargin accountin order for you to trade options contracts. And there may be a minimum balance requirement in order to set this up. This can increase your costs, as it can add interest charges, account fees, not to mention increasing how much you originally intended to invest in the first place.\n\nReduces market risks and volatility\n\nLimit losses and lock in profits\n\nSave on transaction costs and fees\n\nYou need to be experienced in order to take advantage of roll back strategies\n\nSpeculation can lead to more losses\n\nYou may need to set up a margin account, which could increase your costs\n\nTraders have many strategies available to them when they want to exit or enter options contracts. Roll backs are one of those options. These strategies involve exiting one contract and entering a new one in the same class. While some details of the contract may or may not change, one definite is that the expiration date in the new position is always earlier.\n\nRolling strategies help option traders to lock in profits, limit losses, and reducerisk. Investors typically roll contracts because the contract they seek to close is far out of the money.\n\nUsing the following roll strategies can help an investor to increase their profit potential andcapitalizeon market changes:\n\nOnce you sell your option, you generally can't buy it back. But there is a way to eliminate your short position. You can do this by buying a call option with similar details for the same underlying asset, including the strike price and expiry date.\n\nA day trade is any trade, whether that's buying or selling, that takes place within a single day. Options may count as day trades. But they tend to count as single trades because they are held in one contract.\n\nRolling out of an option means that you close and open a position in an options contract at the same time. Roll backs happen when an investor exits a contract with a long-term expiration date and takes a position in one with a shorter-term date.\n\nSchaeffer's Investment Research. \"Rolling Options Out, Up, and Down.\"\n\nCharles Schwab. \"Know When to Roll \u2018Em: How to Roll Options Positions.\"",
