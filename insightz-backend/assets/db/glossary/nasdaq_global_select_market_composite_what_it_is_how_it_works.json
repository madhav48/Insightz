  "term": "NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite: What it is, How it Works",
  "definition": "The NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite is a market capitalization-weightedindexmade up of U.S.-based and international stocks that represent the NASDAQ Global Select Market. As of August 2020, the NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite consisted of more than 1,400 stocks that meet Nasdaq's strict financial and liquidity requirements and corporate governance standards.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe Global Market Select Composite is more exclusive than theGlobal Market Composite. Every October, the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Department reviews the Global Market Composite to determine if any of its stocks have become eligible for listing on the Global Select Market.\n\nThis stock index was created in July 2006 when theNasdaqNational Market split into two tiers, the NASDAQ Global Market and the NASDAQ Global Select Market.The change was nominal, as it did not affect listing standards, but rather was meant to reflect the global scope of the index and the companies listed on it. The select index encompasses about a third of the largest companieslisted on the NASDAQ.\n\nThe companies that comprise each tier of the NASDAQ are placed according to theirmarket capitalization.\u00a0The\u00a0NASDAQ Global Select Market tier is the most selective tier. To qualify for this \"large-cap\" category, a company must meet the strictest financial requirements. A company's stock is reviewed annually to ensure it continues to be listed under the proper tier.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIf a stock meets or exceeds its current market cap requirements, under its current tier, it could be promoted to the larger market capitalization tier. If, however, a company's stock does not measure up to the market cap requirements of its current tier, it can be demoted to a smaller market capitalization tier.\n\nThe NASDAQ has three distinct\u00a0tiers: The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the NASDAQ Global Market,\u00a0and theNASDAQ Capital Market. Potential NASDAQ companies must satisfy a variety of\u00a0financial,liquidity, and corporate governance requirements to be approved for listing on any\u00a0market tier.\n\nRequirements for inclusion in\u00a0the NASDAQ\u00a0Global Select Market are the most\u00a0stringent of the three. Requirements for the NASDAQ\u00a0Global Market are more stringent than those for the NASDAQ\u00a0Capital Market. It's important to note thatcorporate governance requirementsare the same across all NASDAQ\u00a0market tiers.\n\nEven though a company\u2019s securities qualify for initial inclusion, NASDAQ\u00a0may deny initial listing, or apply additional conditions, if necessary to protect investors and the public interest.\n\nA company interested in pursuing astock market listingon the Nasdaq must complete and submit an application. In general, it will take Nasdaq four to six weeks to process a new listing application. The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Staff is responsible for conducting a preliminary review of the application and issuing the company a comment letter. The company will have a specified time period to resolve or address any issues raised in the comment letter. If all issues are resolved satisfactorily, Nasdaq will complete their review and the company will be approved for listing.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAs mentioned, the listing requirements for NASDAQ Global Select are more stringent than the other tiers. To meet the financial requirements, a company will need to meet all the criteria of at least one of these four standards established by Nasdaq:\n\nAdditionally, the company must meet liquidity requirements that vary depending on whether the company is aninitial public offering (IPO), aspinoff, or already currently trading common stock.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nNasdaq Global Indexes. \"NASDAQ Global Select Market Composite (NQGS).\" Accessed Aug. 28, 2020.\n\nNasdaq. \"Initial Listing Guide,\" pages 4, 6-10.
