  "term": "Macro Manager: Definition, How Management Works, and Benefits",
  "definition": "A macro manager is a type of boss or supervisor who takes a more hands-off approach and lets employees do their jobs with minimal direct supervision. This style of leadership is referred to as macro-management. Macro managers can be thought of by some employees as supervisors who do not give them enough support or feedback to do their jobs effectively, while others may be glad to be trusted and left alone.\n\nA macro manager is the opposite of amicromanager, a supervisor who constantly looks over employees' shoulders and is often perceived as controlling and overly critical.\n\nIn managing a firm and its employees, different management styles come into play. Micromanagement and macro managers take a birds-eye-view approach, with top-down management decisions that weigh aggregated metrics and aggregate performance. Adopting a macro-management leadership style can include delegating authority and responsibilities, while the manager focuses their attention on developing and executing the overall strategy for the team.\n\nThe term \"macro manager\" can also describe someone who runs a global macrohedge fund. Global macro managers need to have a broad knowledge base to understand big-picture influences on investment performance in the global marketplace. Such influences include political events, government policies, and the way different countries'\u00a0central banks function. George Soros,\u00a0Julian Robertson,\u00a0and\u00a0Michael\u00a0Steinhardt\u00a0are well-known global macro managers.\n\nMacro management may be seen as beneficial and suitable for the upper tiers of an organization\u2019s hierarchy, as it grants employees room to act with more autonomy. For example, an executive leader of a division within an organization may task the staff who works under them to adhere to an overall strategic plan but make their own decisions on how best to execute that strategy. Likewise, the president of a company may present broad ideas to the executive team they lead and rely on their individual expertise to take action rather than give them orders that cover the minutest details.\n\nThere can be drawbacks to working with a macro manager. They may be distant and not directly informed about the day-to-day issues the team faces. It can take time before they are made aware of problems or challenges the team must deal with.\n\nFurthermore, a macro manager could be seen as little more as than an extra layer ofbureaucracy, with limited activity interest in the tasks at hand. Their minimal direct involvement with subordinates can be regarded as a lack of awareness or understanding of the work each employee is asked to perform. This can affect the team\u2019s ability to achieve milestones and meet deadlines if the manager is not fully aware of obstacles that may impede the team\u2019s ability to take action.",
