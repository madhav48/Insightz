It is calculated by taking total annual\u00a0expenses, excludingdepreciationand debt-related expenses, and dividing it by the annual gross income.\n\nThis is the formula for calculating working ratio:\n\n\ufeffWorking\u00a0Ratio=TAE\u2212(Depreciation+Debt\u00a0Expenses)Annual\u00a0Gross\u00a0Incomewhere:TAE=total\u00a0annual\u00a0expenses\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Working Ratio} = \\frac{ \\text{TAE} - ( \\text{Depreciation} + \\text{Debt Expenses} ) }{ \\text{Annual Gross Income} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{TAE} = \\text{total annual expenses} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bWorking\u00a0Ratio=Annual\u00a0Gross\u00a0IncomeTAE\u2212(Depreciation+Debt\u00a0Expenses)\u200bwhere:TAE=total\u00a0annual\u00a0expenses\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe working ratio is tasked with gauging a company's financial sustainability. All businesses will incur costs to operate and generate sales. These costs range from rent, equipment, andinventorycharges, to marketing, staff wages, andinsurance. Those who are unable to consistently clear these expenses and pay their bills aren\u2019t running a viable business and probably won\u2019t be in business for long.\n\nThe threshold for this ratio is one. Any number below that indicates that the company is able to recover operating costs\u2014lower figures are synonymous withexpenseseating up a small chunk ofgross income. Conversely, a ratio above one implies that the company isn\u2019t breaking even and generating enough money to cover its costs.\n\nA ratio of one means a company\u2019s annual gross income is equal to its total expenditure, so anything below that implies the company is able to recover operating costs, whereas anything above reflects its inability to do so.\n\nXYZ Inc. has been making widgets since the 1900s and is seen in the industry as a somewhat antiquated brand. XYZ hasn't spent very much money overhauling its machinery over the years and is still using old technology to manufacture its end product.\n\nManagement argues that not upgrading to the latest model has saved it money that can be better spent elsewhere. The problem is the equipment it uses is power-intensive and expensive to run andmaintainrelative to newer versions. This means that continuing to use the old technology actually works out to be more expensive in the long-run.\n\nTo make matters worse, XYZ is also losingmarket shareevery year to its more modern competitors. Sales are falling and costs are rising, leading to a progressively higher working ratio. Recently it rose above one, the tipping point, and analysts fear it will continue to climb\u2014putting the business in danger of reneging on payments\u2014unless drastic changes are soon made to slash costs and catch up with the competition.\n\nThe working ratio is not perfect and cannot be fully relied on to determine a company\u2019sfinancial healthand ability to cover expenses with the money it brings in.\n\nOne issue is that it does not takefinancing costsinto consideration. This oversight can lead to misleading results, particularly as most companies borrow money to fund growth and are required to pay back these loans, together withinterest, punctually.\n\nThe ratio also does not account for projected changes in operating expenses. In some industries, operating costs have a tendency to fluctuate from year to year and in certain periods can be uncharacteristically low or high for a good reason.\n\nIf the company has cash tucked away to bankroll extra costs, and is poised to generate extrarevenuesoff them in the future, its current high working ratio shouldn\u2019t necessarily be a cause for alarm.\n\nWhen applying ratios, investors are advised to not always take the number that is generated at face value. Context is important and further digging to see if there is a reasonable explanation behind unusual results is a must.\n\nIn general, every ratio tends to overlook something important. That ultimately means that it\u2019s usually necessary to consult several at the same time to get an accurate, more complete picture of how the subject is faring. The more information that is taken into consideration the better chance investors have at making more informed decisions about where to allocate their money.",
