  "definition": "MoMo Productions / Getty Images\n\nTrust property refers to assets that have been placed into afiduciaryrelationship between a trustor and trustee for a designated beneficiary. Trust property may include any type of asset,\u00a0including cash, securities, real estate, or life insurance policies. Trust property is also referred to as \"trust assets\"\u00a0or \"trust corpus.\"\n\nThetrusteeis required to manage the trust property in accordance with thetrustor's wishes and in\u00a0thebeneficiary's best interests. A trustee can be an individual or a financial institution, such as a bank. A trustor\u2014sometimes called a \"settlor\" or \"grantor\"\u2014can also serve as a trustee managing assets for the benefit\u00a0of another individual,such as a child.\n\nRegardless of the role a trustee plays, the individual or organization must abide by specific rules and laws that govern the functioning of whichever type of trust is established.\u00a0Once property has been transferred to a trust, the trust itself becomes the rightful owner of the assets. In an irrevocable trust, the assets can no longer be controlled or claimed by the previous owner.\n\nThere are several different types of trusts. They typically fall under two categories:revocable trustsandirrevocable trusts.\n\nIn a revocable arrangement, the trustor\u00a0maintains legal ownership and control of trust assets. For this reason, the trustor\u00a0would be responsible for paying taxes on the income those assets generate, and the trust may also be subject toestate taxesshould its value breach the tax-exempt threshold at the time of the grantor's death.\u00a0(In 2025, that threshold is $13.99 million.)\n\nWith an irrevocable trust, the trustor\u00a0passes legal ownership of the trust assets to a trustee. This means those assets are no longer the trustor's property,\u00a0effectively lowering\u00a0the taxable portion of an individual's estate. The trustor also relinquishes certain rights to amend the trust agreement. For example, a trustor usually can't change beneficiaries\u00a0of\u00a0an irrevocable trust after they have been established. This is not the case with a revocable trust.\n\nA trustor may be referred to as grantor or donor in certain situations.\n\nTrusts can be created during an individual's lifetime, or they can be established following the grantor's death. This situation applies toPayable on Death (POD)trusts, which transfer assets to a beneficiary following the death of the trustor. Generally speaking, this type of trust and similar ones are called testamentary trusts because property is actually transferred following the trustor's death. Assets in these trusts flow directly to the intended beneficiaries following the trustor's death, which means they avoidprobate, the often long and expensive legal process of validating and distributing assets outlined in a will. These trusts can also be outlined in a person's will.\n\nAssets withinliving trustscan be transferred during the trustor's lifetime. For example, parents might openaccounts in trustwith banks for the benefit of their children or to help fund their college expenses. A trustee carefully manages the assets held in the account to achieve this goal, but the children don't have complete access to the funds or the freedom to spend income from the fund as they please. An example of this type of arrangement is aUnified Gift to Minors Act (UGMA)account.\u00a0In some cases, beneficiaries such as children would have access to the trust's assets and the income they generate only after reaching a certain age.\n\nNo, anyone can use a trust. Certain types of trusts can be beneficial for families of all backgrounds, such as aspecial needs trust, which holds assets for a beneficiary who has a disability.\n\nAccording to the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, 6% of families reported having \"any kind of trust or managed investment account\" in 2022.\n\nYes, a trustee can be a beneficiary of the trust, but only if they are not the sole beneficiary.\n\nTrust property is typically tied into anestate planningstrategy\u00a0used to facilitate the transfer of assets upon death and to reducetax liability. Sometrustscan also protect assets in the event of a bankruptcy or lawsuit.\u00a0If you're considering forming one, reach out to an estate planning attorney who specializes in trusts.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2019 to 2022.\"",
