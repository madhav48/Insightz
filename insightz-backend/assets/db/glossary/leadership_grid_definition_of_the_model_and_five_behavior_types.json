  "definition": "The Leadership Grid is a model of behavioral leadership developed in the 1960s by Robert Blake and Jane Mouton. Previously known as the Managerial Grid, the Leadership Grid\u00a0is based on two behavioral dimensions:\u00a0concern for production, which is\u00a0plotted on the X-axis on a scale from one to nine points; andconcern for people, which is plotted on a similar scale along the Y-axis.\n\nThe model identified fiveleadership stylesby their relative positions on the grid. The first number in the examples below reflects a leader's concern for production; the second number is a leader's concern for people.\n\nThe Leadership Grid demonstrates that placing an undue emphasis on one area, while overlooking the other, stifles productivity. The model proposes that the Team leadership style, which displays a high degree of concern for both production and people, may boost employee productivity.\n\nSome of the perceived benefits of using the Leadership Grid include its ability to measure performance as well as the ability to perform a self-analysis of your own leadership style. Businesses and organizations continue to use the grid.\n\nThere are some perceived limitations to the Leadership Grid, however. For example, it may offer a flawed self-assessment, due in part to its use of minimal empirical data to support the effectiveness of the grid. The model also does not take into account a variety of factors, such as the work environment and internal or external variables that may be factors.\n\nThe Impoverished or Indifferent\u00a0leadership style in the model refers to the style that shows\u00a0little regard for the team or overall production. Such leaders'\u00a0efforts and concerns are more centered on self-preservation, which includes not allowing any actions to blowback on them.\n\nThe Produce\u00a0or Perish leadership style focuses solely on production with a Draconian disregard for the needs of the workers on the team. The leader who follows this path may see high attrition rates due to their need for control and neglect of the team's needs.\n\nThe Middle of the Road leadership approach offers a balance of speaking to the team\u2019s needs as well as the organization\u2019s production needs, but neither aspect is adequately fulfilled in the process. This may lead to average and below average results in team performance and satisfaction.\n\nSomeone with a Country Club leadership style sees the team\u2019s needs first and foremost over everything else. The assumption by the leader is that happiness within the team will naturally lead to improved productivity;\u00a0however, there is no guarantee.\n\nThe Team approach is considered to be the most effective form of leadership, according to the Leadership Grid's creators. The leader shows a commitment to staff empowerment as well as toward\u00a0increasing productivity. By encouraging the workers to operate as a team, the belief is they will be motivated to accomplish more.",
