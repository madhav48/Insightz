  "definition": "Neoclassical growth theory is an economic theory that outlines how a steadyeconomic growth rateresults from a combination of three driving forces\u2014labor, capital, and technology. The National Bureau of Economic Research names Robert Solow and Trevor Swan as having the credit of developing and introducing themodelof long-run economic growth in 1956. The model first considered exogenous population increases to set the growth rate but, in 1957, Solow incorporated technology change into the model.\n\nThe theory states that short-term equilibrium results from varying amounts of labor and capital in the production function. The theory also argues that technological change has a major influence on an economy,\u00a0and economic growth cannot continue without technological advances.\n\nNeoclassical growth theory outlines\u00a0the three factors necessary for a growing economy. These are labor, capital, and technology. However, neoclassical growth theory clarifies\u00a0that temporary equilibrium is different from long-term equilibrium, which does not require any of these three factors.\n\nThis growth theory posits that the accumulation of capital within an economy, and how\u00a0people use that capital, is important for economic growth. Further, the relationship between the capital and labor of an economy determines its output. Finally, technology is thought to augmentlabor productivityand increase\u00a0the output capabilities of labor.\n\nTherefore, the production function of neoclassical growth theory is used to measure the growth and equilibrium of an economy. That function is Y = AF (K, L).\n\nHowever, because of the relationship between labor and technology, an economy's production function is often rewritten as\u00a0Y = F (K, AL).\n\nIncreasing any one of the inputs shows the effect on\u00a0GDP\u00a0and, therefore, the equilibrium\u00a0of an economy. However, if the three factors of neoclassical growth theory are not all equal, the returns of both unskilled labor and capital on an economy diminish. These diminished returns imply\u00a0that increases in these two inputs have exponentially decreasing returns while technology is boundless in its contribution to growth and the resulting output it can produce.\n\nA 2016 study published inEconomic Themesby Dragoslava Sredojevi\u0107, Slobodan Cvetanovi\u0107, and Gorica Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 titled \"Technological Changes in Economic Growth Theory: Neoclassical, Endogenous, and Evolutionary-Institutional Approach\" examined the role of technology specifically and its role in the neoclassical growth theory.\n\nThe authors find a consensus among different economic perspectives all pointing to technological change as a key generator of economic growth. For example, neoclassicists have historically pressured some governments to invest in scientific and research development toward innovation.\n\nEndogenous theorysupporters emphasize factors such as technological spillover and research and development as catalysts for innovation and economic growth. Lastly, evolutionary and institutional economists consider the economic and social environment in their models for technological innovation and economic growth.\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). \"Trevor Swan and the Neoclassical Growth Model,\" Pages ii, 2-3, 10-11, 13.\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. \"Trevor Swan and the Neoclassical Growth Model,\" Page ii.\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. \"Trevor Swan and the Neoclassical Growth Model.\"\n\nSimon Fraser University. \"Chapter 1 Neoclassical Growth Theory,\" Pages 2-4.\n\nResearchGate. \"Technological Changes in Economic Growth Theory: Neoclassical, Endogenous, and Evolutionary-Institutional Approach.\"",
