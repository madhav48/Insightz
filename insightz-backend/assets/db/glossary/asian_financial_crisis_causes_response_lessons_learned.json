  "definition": "Michela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nThe Asian financial crisis was spurred by currency devaluations and affected Asian economies from 1997 to 1998.\n\nThe Asian financial crisis, also called the \u201cAsianContagion,\u201d was a sequence ofcurrency devaluationsand other events that began in July 1997 and spread across Asia.\n\nThe crisis started in Thailand when the government ended the local currency\u2019s de factopegto the U.S. dollar after depleting much of the country\u2019sforeign exchange reservestrying to defend it against months of speculative pressure.\n\nJust weeks after Thailand stopped defendingits currency, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia were also compelled to let their currencies fall as speculative market pressure built. By October, the crisis spread to South Korea, where abalance-of-paymentscrisis brought the government to the brink ofdefault.\n\nOthereconomiesalso came under pressure, but those with solid economic fundamentals and hefty foreign exchange reserves fared much better. Hong Kong fended off several major but unsuccessful speculative attacks onits currency, which is pegged to theU.S. dollarvia a currency board system and backed by massive U.S. dollar reserves.\n\nAs the Thai baht fell, other Asian currencies fell\u2014some precipitously. Across Asia, inflows ofcapitalslowed or reversed.\n\nThe Thai baht had been trading at about 26 to the U.S. dollar before the crisis but lost half its value by the end of 1997, falling to 53 to the dollar by January 1998. TheSouth Korean wonfell from about 900 to the dollar to 1,695 by the end of 1997. TheIndonesian rupiah, which had been trading at around 2,400 to the dollar in June 1997, plummeted to 14,900 by June 1998, less than one-sixth its precrisis level.\n\nSome of the more heavily affected countries fell into severerecession. Indonesia\u2019sgross domestic product (GDP)growth fell from 4.7% in 1997 to -13.1% in 1998.In the Philippines, it slid from 5.2% to -0.5% over the same period.Malaysia\u2019s GDP growth similarly slid from 7.3% in 1997 to -7.4% in 1998, while South Korea\u2019s contracted from 6.3% to -4.9%.\n\nIn Indonesia, the ensuing economic crisis led to the collapse of the three-decade-old dictatorship of President Suharto.\n\nThe crisis was alleviated by intervention from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF)andThe World Bank, among others, which poured some $118 billion into Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea to bail out their economies.\n\nAs a result of the crisis, affected countries restructured their economies, generally because the IMF required reform as a condition of help. The specific policy changes were different in each country but generally involved strengthening weak financial systems, loweringdebtlevels, raisinginterest ratesto stabilize currencies, and cutting government spending.\n\nThe crisis also serves as a valuable case study foreconomiststo understand how interwoven markets affect one another, especially as it relates to currency trading and national accounts management.\n\nThe crisis was rooted in several threads of industrial, financial, and monetary government policies and the investment trends that they created. Once the crisis began, markets reacted strongly, and one currency after another came under pressure. Some of themacroeconomicproblems includedcurrent account deficits, high levels offoreign debt, climbingbudget deficits, excessivebanklending, poordebt-serviceratios, and imbalancedcapital inflowsandoutflows.\n\nMany of these problems were the result of policies to promoteexport-led economic growthin the years leading up to the crisis. Governments worked closely with manufacturers to support exports, including providingsubsidiesto favored businesses, more favorable financing, and a currency peg to the U.S. dollar to ensure anexchange ratefavorable to exporters.\n\nWhile this did support exports, it also createdrisk. Explicit and implicit government guarantees tobail outdomestic industries and banks meant investors often did not assess the profitability of an investment but instead looked to its political support. Investment policies also created cozy relationships among local conglomerates, financial institutions, and the regulators who oversaw their industries. Large volumes of foreign money flowed in, often with little attention to potential risks. These factors all contributed to a massivemoral hazardin Asian economies, encouraging major investment in marginal and potentially unsound projects.\n\nAs the crisis spread, it became clear that the impressive economic growth rates in these countries were concealing serious vulnerabilities. In particular, domesticcredithad expanded rapidly for years, often poorly supervised, creating significantleveragealong with loans extended to dubious projects. Rapidly risingreal estatevalues (often fueled by easy access to credit) contributed to the problem, along with rising current account deficits and a buildup in external debt.\u00a0Heavy foreign borrowing, often at shortmaturities, also exposed corporations and banks to significantexchange rateandfunding risks\u2014risks that had been masked by long-standing currency pegs. When the pegs fell apart, companies that owed money in foreign currencies suddenly owed a lot more in local currency terms, forcing many intoinsolvency.\n\nMany Asian economies had also slid intocurrent accountdeficits. If a country has a current account surplus, that means it is essentially a netlenderto the rest of the world. If the current account balance is negative, then the country is anet borrowerfrom the rest of the world. Current account deficits had grown on the back of heavy government spending (much of it directed to supporting continued export growth).\n\nThe IMF intervened to stem the crisis withloansto stabilize the affected economies. The IMF and others lent roughly $118 billion in short-term loans to Thailand, Indonesia, and South Korea.The bailouts came with conditions, though: Governments had to raise taxes, cut spending, and eliminate many subsidies. By 1999, many of the affected countries began to show signs ofrecovery.\n\nOther financial institutions also intervened. For example, in December 1997, the U.S.Federal Reserve Bankbrokered a deal under which U.S. banks owed money by South Korean companies on short-term loansvoluntarily agreed to roll them over into medium-term loans.\n\nMany of the lessons of the Asian financial crisis remain relevant today. First, beware of assetbubbles, as they have a habit of bursting. Another is that governments need to control spending and pursue prudent economic development policies.\n\nWhen governments spend, implement policies that keep taxes low, subsidize the price of staplegoods, or use other methods that effectively put more money in people\u2019s pockets, consumers have more money to spend. As most economies rely at least partly onimportsfor many goods andservices, this increased spending creates demand for foreign currency (usually U.S. dollars), as importers have to sell local currency and buy foreign currency to pay for imports.\n\nDemand for foreign currency (and selling of local currency to buy it) increases exponentially when those policies also promote heavy investment in infrastructure, new businesses, and other economic projects. As more local currency is offered for sale on foreign exchange markets, its value goes down, unless there is a corresponding demand to buy it (say, by exporters selling foreign currency that they earn fromexports).\n\nGovernments, especially indeveloping economies, seek to manage exchange rates to balance their ability to pay debts denominated in foreign currencies. Because investors generally prefer instruments denominated in more stable currencies, governments in developing economies often raise funds by issuing bonds denominated in U.S. dollars,Japanese yen, oreuros.\n\nHowever, if the value of the domestic currency falls vs. the currency in which its debt is denominated, that effectively increases the debt, as more local currency is needed to pay it. So, when the Thai baht lost half of its value in 1997, that meant local borrowers needed twice as many baht to pay debts denominated in U.S. dollars. As many developing countries also rely on imports, a higher-valued local currency also makes those imports cheaper in local currency terms.\n\nConversely, governments may seek to keep their exchange rates low to increase the competitiveness of exports.\n\nIn the 1980s, following years of complaints from U.S. companies about competition from cheap Japanese imports, the U.S. government convinced Japan to allow its currency toappreciateas part of thePlaza Accord.The currency\u2019s value climbed from 250 yen to one U.S. dollar in early 1985 to less than 130 yen by 1990. The U.S.trade deficitwith Japan fell from $55 billion in 1986 to $41 billion in 1990.\n\nIn 1997, decades of economic policy planning that featured close relationships among government policy planners, regulators, the industries they regulated, and financial institutions came to a head when markets began putting downward pressure on Asian currencies. The most vulnerable were those countries with high levels of debt and insufficient financing to pay it.\n\nThe IMF stepped in to bail out the most affected economies, but it imposed strict conditions in exchange for the help. Some measures included requiring governments to cut spending, raise taxes, eliminate subsidies, and restructure their financial systems.\n\nThe crisis also serves as a case study in asset bubbles and how quicklypanic sellingcan trigger contagion thatcentral bankerscannot control.\n\nFederal Reserve History. \u201cAsian Financial Crisis.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority. \u201cHow Does the LERS Work?\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cIndonesia: Country Data.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cPhilippines: Country Data.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cMalaysia: Country Data.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cRepublic of Korea: Country Data.\u201d\n\nParliament of Australia, Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Group, via ParlInfo. \u201cIndonesia in Crisis: Economy, Society, and Politics.\u201d\n\nStanford University News, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cDollar/Yen Wars a Lingering Pox on Both Countries\u2019 Houses, Economists Say.\u201d\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \u201cTrade In Goods with Japan.\u201d",
