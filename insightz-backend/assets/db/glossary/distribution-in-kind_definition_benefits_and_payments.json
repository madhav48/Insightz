  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA distribution-in-kind, also referred to as a distribution-in-specie, is a payment made in the form ofsecuritiesor other property rather than in cash. A distribution-in-kind may be made in several different situations, including the payment of astock dividendor inheritance, or taking securities out of atax-deferredaccount. It can also refer to the transfer of anassetto abeneficiaryover the option ofliquidatingthe position and transferring the cash.\n\nInvestors can invest in a company by buying bonds or stocks. Bonds pay investors areturnin the form of interest payments. Stocks pay investors a return in the form ofdividendsand share priceappreciation. A dividend orshare buybackis adistributionof cash to investors.\n\nIn general, companies that are doing well pay out healthy and growing dividends. These companies also buy back stock. Companies with declining earnings may be forced to buy back stock or pay dividends with borrowed funds. Another alternative is to distribute dividends-in-kind.\n\nA distribution-in-kind may also be employed for tax reasons. In certain situations, receiving appreciated property directly can result in a lower tax bill versus selling the property and receiving the value of the property in cash.\n\nSome funds deliver distributions-in-kind to investors after a certain threshold. If an investor redeems shares in the fund over the threshold, the remainder of the redemption value is paid in kind with shares of the fund. The reason for doing this is to prevent large tax hits in the event of high redemption activity.\n\nIn-kind distributions are not just advantageous for the company. Investors in tax-deferred accounts like to receive distributions-in-kind because they help to reduce taxes. People who inherit shares generally receive them in kind for this reason. Investors with individual retirement plans\u00a0can also take distributions-in-kind\u2014such as for therequired\u00a0minimum distributions(RMDs) they have to take.\u00a0This means people can take the actual stocks and bonds out of the account as a distribution without liquidating them.\n\nDistributions-in-kind can be used for an entire required minimum distribution (RMD).\n\nInvestors who wish to keep fully invested accounts may find this to be a valuable option. Distributions-in-kind are also good for stocks that are undervalued or may go up significantly. This allows the investor to record the profit from share price appreciation as acapital gainrather than as ordinary income, which is generally taxed at a higher rate.\n\nIn-kind distributions are also a favored method for distributing proceeds in theventure capitalandprivate equityfields. Instead of liquidating holdings and making cash distributions to limited partners, funds hand the investors equivalent securities to avoid capital gains tax on liquidated holdings.\n\nDistributions-in-kind forreal estatetransactions may not be exempt fromcapital gains tax. The company or organization making an in-kind distribution of property instead of cash will still have to pay capital gains tax incurred by any appreciation in the property's price.\n\nA similar case exists for transfers made toestatesortrustsby asettlor. Such transfers of assets are taxable, and so the settlor is required to report capital gains or losses (and the tax due, if any) on their income tax returns.\n\nA required minimum distribution (RMD) is the amount of money that you must withdraw from a retirement account each year after you reach a certain age: 72 or 73, depending on your birth year.\n\nIt is a rule established by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)to ensure that the funds in your retirement account are being withdrawn, rather than kept in a tax-sheltered account indefinitely (as, for example, an eventual inheritance for yourheirs). If you're 72 or 73 and still working, you can delay taking RMDs from your workplace plan, such as a 401(k), until you retire, unless you own 5% or more of the business that's sponsoring the retirement plan.\n\nCapital gains taxes are typically lower than income taxes. The capital gains tax ranges from 0% to 20%, with a few exceptions: some stock and collectibles might be taxed at a 28% rate, and real estate gains can be up to 25%.Income taxes, on the other hand, go even higher, up to 37%. (The 2024 tax brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.)\n\nBoth dividends and distributions serve aspayoutsfor investors. However, they're taxed differently. Dividends are with after-tax funds, whereas distributions are with before-tax funds.\n\nNot all distributions are made in cash; some are made in kind. The most common form of distribution-in-kind is when a company pays a dividend in stock rather than in cash. Distributions-in-kind can also be used in real estate, trusts, venture capital, and private equity, primarily for tax reasons.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"",
