Insurance premiums are paid on policies that cover a variety of personal and commercial risks. If the policyowner fails to pay the premium, the insurance company may cancel the policy.\n\nWhen you sign up for aninsurance policy, your insurer will charge you a premium. This is the amount you pay to keep the policy in force. Policyholders may\u00a0choose from\u00a0severaloptions for\u00a0paying their\u00a0insurance premiums. Some insurers allow the policyholder to pay the insurance premium in installments\u2014such as monthly or annually\u2014while others may require an upfront payment for each full year before any coverage starts.\n\nThe price\u00a0of the premiumdepends\u00a0on a variety of factors, including:\n\nThere may be additional charges payable to the insurer on top of the premium, including taxes or services fees.\n\nInsurance companiesmake moneyby collecting premiums and by investing this revenue in safe financial instruments, such as bonds. Once the insurance company earns the premium by providing protection, it becomes\u00a0income for\u00a0the carrier.Unearned premiumsalso represent a liability, as the insurer must provide coverage for claims being made against the policy.\n\nInsurance companies consider a variety of factors to decide how much premium they will charge a given policyowner for a given set of coverages. While some of those factors are common across most types of insurance (such as the age of the insured), others vary depending on the type of coverage,\n\nThe main factors in determining automobile insurance premiums include your driving record, your geographic location, how often you use your car, the type of car(s) being insured, your gender, your credit record, and your age. Another consideration is thetype of insurance coverageyou purchase, include the limits on coverage amounts and thedeductibles.\n\nFor example, the likelihood of a claim being made against a teenage driver living in an urban area may be higher than a teenage driver\u00a0in a suburban area. Similarly, younger and newer drivers carry a greater risk of being involved in an accident than older, more experienced drivers. In general, the greater theriskassociated, the more expensive the insurance premiums.\n\nIn the case of a life insurance policy, the major factors the company looks at in pricing coverage are an insured's risk ofmortality, the interest it expects to earn by investing your premium, and the expenses it will incur.The age at which you begin coverage will determine your premium amount, along with other risk factors (such as your current health). The younger you are, the lower your premiums will generally be. Conversely, the older you get, the more you pay in premiums to your insurance company. High-value policies will also carry a higher permium.\n\nSince life insurance covers a period of many years, there may be more flexibility in how you pay your premiums. A few insurers may offerpremium cash flow payment plans. These plans allow the policyholder to pay the premium in small intervals. Some policyholders might also usepremium financingto pay for expensive premiums, but there is risk involved with this process.\n\nTheAffordable Care Act(ACA) of 2010 spelled out a number of rules that regulate how insurance company can set determine the premiums they charge. For companies that offer coverage through theACA Health Insurance Marketplace, there are five major factors that insurances can use to set rates: age, category of insurance plan, your geographic location, tobacco use, and whether the enrollment covers an individual or a family. Marketplace plans must also charge men and women the same rates, and cannot take your health history into account.\n\nInsurance companies employactuariesto determine risk levels and premium prices for\u00a0a given insurance policy and for groups of policies. While the emergence of sophisticated algorithms and artificial intelligence\u00a0is changing how insurance is priced and sold, human actuaries are still key to the process. Actuaries use mathematics, statistics, and financial theory to analyze the economic costs of the potential risks in a policy or group of policies. They rely on computer models to analyze previous experiences and anticipate future outcomes so they can set premiums that allow the insurance company to make a profit while charging competitive prices.\n\nOnce premiums are determined, insurers use this revenue from their customers to cover liabilities associated with the policies they underwrite. They may also\u00a0invest premiums to generate higher returns. This can offset some costs of providing insurance coverage and help an insurer keep its prices competitive in the marketplace.\n\nWhile life insurance premiums are generally set for the lifetime of the insured, actuaries for health and auto insurers adjust premiums on a regular basis. Insurance premiums may increase after the policy period ends. The insurer may increase the premium for claims made during the previous period if the risk associated with offering a particular type of insurance increases, or if the cost of providing coverage increases.\n\nWhile insurance companies may invest in assets with varying levels ofliquidityand returns, they are required to maintain a certain level of liquidity at all times. State insurance regulators set\u00a0the number of liquid assets necessary\u00a0to ensure\u00a0insurers\u00a0can\u00a0pay claims.\n\nMost consumers find shopping around to be the best way to find the lowest insurance premiums. You may choose to shop on your own with individual insurance companies or through aggregation sites that offer prices from multiple insurers. It's fairly easy to obtain quotes by yourself online.\n\nFor example, ACA enabled uninsured consumers to shop for health insurance policies on its marketplace. Upon logging in, the site requires some basic information, such as your name, date of birth, address, and income, along with the personal information of anyone else in your household. You can choose from several options available based on your home state\u2014each with different premiums, deductibles, and copays\u2014the policy coverage changes based on the amount you pay. Providers will base premiums on the enrolee's state, the individual's history, and other factors.\n\nThe other option is going through an insurance agent or broker. They tend to work with a number of different companies and can try to get you the best quote. Many brokers can connect you to life, auto, home, health,liability, and other insurance policies. However, it's important to remember that some of these brokers may largely be motivated by the salescommissionsthey earn.\n\nInsurers use the premiums paid to them by their customers and policyholders to cover liabilities associated with the policies they underwrite. Most insurers also invest the premiums to generate higher returns. By doing so, the companies can offset some costs of providing insurance coverage and help keep its prices competitive.\n\nInsurance premiums depend on a variety of factors, including the type of coverage being purchased by the policyholder, the age of the policyholder, where the policyholder lives, and the claim history of the policyholder. Insurance premiums may increase after the policy period ends or if the risk associated with offering a particular type of insurance increases. The insurer may also change if the amount of coverage changes.\n\nMost insurance companoes allow you to pay your premiums monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nAn actuary assesses and manages the risks of financial investments, insurance policies, and other potentially risky ventures. Actuaries assess particular situations' financial risks, primarily using probability, economic theory, and computer science.\u00a0Most actuaries work at insurance companies, where their risk-management capabilities are particularly applicable in determining risk levels and premium prices for\u00a0a given insurance policy.\n\nAllstate. \"What Are Insurance Premiums, Deductibles and Limits?\"\n\nInsurance Information Institute. \"What Determines the Price of an Auto Insurance Policy?\"\n\nNew York Department of Financial Services. \"The Cost of Life Insurance.\"\n\nHealthCare.gov. \"How Insurance Companies Set Health Premiums.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"What Actuaries Do.\"\n\nHealthCare.gov. \"Getting a Health Insurance Marketplace Plan: 4 Steps.\"\n\nProgressive. \"What Is a Car Insurance Premium?\"",
