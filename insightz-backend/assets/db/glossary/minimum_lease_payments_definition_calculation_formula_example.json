  "definition": "The minimum lease payment is the lowest amount that a lessor can expect to make (and a lessee can expect to pay) over the lifetime of the lease. Accountants calculate minimum lease payments in order to assign a present value to a lease in order to record the lease properly in the company's books.\n\nThe method of calculating minimum lease payments is laid out in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13), Accounting for Leases, which was published by theFinancial Accounting Standards Board(FASB) in 1980.\n\nThe present value formula encompasses the minimum lease payments and the value of the total lease. Leased equipment often has a residual value at the end of the lease term, which is an estimate of the amount of value remaining in the leased asset.\n\n\ufeffPV=\u2211i=0n[Pmti(1+r)]+Res(1+r)nwhere:PV=Present\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0minimum\u00a0lease\u00a0paymentsPmti=Lease\u00a0payment\u00a0for\u00a0periodir=Interest\u00a0raten=Number\u00a0of\u00a0payment\u00a0periodsRes=Residual\u00a0amount\\begin{aligned} &PV = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} \\left[ \\frac{Pmt_i}{\\left(1+r\\right)} \\right] + \\frac{Res}{\\left(1+r\\right)^n} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &PV = \\text{Present value of the minimum lease payments} \\\\ &Pmt_i = \\text{Lease payment for period } i\\\\ &r = \\text{Interest rate} \\\\ &n = \\text{Number of payment periods} \\\\ &Res = \\text{Residual amount} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bPV=i=0\u2211n\u200b[(1+r)Pmti\u200b\u200b]+(1+r)nRes\u200bwhere:PV=Present\u00a0value\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0minimum\u00a0lease\u00a0paymentsPmti\u200b=Lease\u00a0payment\u00a0for\u00a0periodir=Interest\u00a0raten=Number\u00a0of\u00a0payment\u00a0periodsRes=Residual\u00a0amount\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe minimum lease payment calculation is an important part of an accounting analysis called the recovery of investment test (90% test). This test is used to decide whether a lease should be recorded in the company's books as anoperatingorcapital lease. The accounting treatment for minimum lease payments differs, depending on whether you're the lessee or the lessor.\n\nWhen a company cannot afford to fully purchase equipment or expects it to have a short useful life, it may opt to lease the equipment. The lessor owns the equipment and rents it out. Thelesseemakes regularly scheduled payments to the lessor for the use of the equipment. The lessee is expected to make a minimum payment during the contractual period that the equipment is leased out. The minimum payment is known as the minimum lease payment.\n\nMinimum lease payments are rental payments over the lease term including the amount of anybargain purchase option, premium, and any guaranteedresidual value, and excluding any rental relating to costs to be met by the lessor and any contingent rentals.\n\nAlthough common sense suggests that the minimum lease payments on a 12-month lease at $1,000 a month should be $12,000, this number can be complicated by contractual clauses. Executory costs like maintenance and insurance are usually excluded because they are the responsibility of the lessor, but other factors can be added to the cost of a lease.\n\nThese include any guarantees made by the lessee to the lessor about the residual value of the leased property at the end of the lease as well as any payments for non-renewal of the lease. Once these are factored in, a reasonable present value can be assigned to the lease for accounting purposes.\n\nThe value of a lease is estimated bydiscountingthe minimum lease payments. Let\u2019s use an example to determine how much a lease will cost in today\u2019s dollars. A company takes out a 3-year lease on a number of heavy-duty trucks.\n\nThe minimum lease payment per month is $3,000 per month or $36,000 per year. Lessors also charge interest as compensation for leasing their equipment. In this case, the interest rate is 5% per year, or 5% divided by12 months = 0.417% per month.\n\nTo calculate thepresent value(PV) of the leased trucks, the residual value must be factored in. The residual value is the value of the trucks after the lease period is over. Let\u2019s assume, in this case, that the residual value is $45,000.\n\nThe annual interest rate on the lease is used as thediscount ratein calculating the PV. The PV on the trucks\u2019 lease can be calculated using the PV formula, and including the residual in the calculation, as follows:\n\n\ufeffPV=$36,0001.051+$36,0001.052+$36,0001.053+$45,0001.053=$34,285.71+$32,653.06+$31,098.83+$38,873.53=$136,911.13\\begin{aligned} PV =& \\ \\frac{ \\$\\text{36,000} }{ 1.05^1 } + \\frac { \\$\\text{36,000} }{ 1.05^2 } + \\frac {\\$\\text{36,000} }{1.05^3 } + \\frac { \\$\\text{45,000} }{ 1.05^3 } \\\\ =& \\ \\$\\text{34,285.71} + \\$\\text{32,653.06} + \\$\\text{31,098.83} +\\\\ &\\ \\$\\text{38,873.53} \\\\ =& \\ \\$\\text{136,911.13} \\\\ \\end{aligned}PV===\u200b1.051$36,000\u200b+1.052$36,000\u200b+1.053$36,000\u200b+1.053$45,000\u200b$34,285.71+$32,653.06+$31,098.83+$38,873.53$136,911.13\u200b\ufeff\n\nIn today\u2019s value, the lease will be estimated to cost $136,911.13.",
