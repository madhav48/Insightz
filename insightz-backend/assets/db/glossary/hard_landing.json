The term \"hard landing\" comes from aviation, where it refers to the kind of high-speed landing that\u2014while not an actual crash\u2014is a source of stress as well as potential damage and injury. The metaphor is used for high-flying economies that run into a sudden, sharp check on their growth, such as amonetary policyintervention meant to curb inflation. Economies that experience a hard landing often slip into a stagnant period or evenrecession.\n\nA hard landing can be contrasted to to a soft landing, which is considered to be a more desirable goal for economic policy makers. To achieve asoft landing, government official and central banks will gradually reduceexpansionaryfiscal and monetary policy in an attempt to curb price inflation without sacrificing jobs or unnecessarily inflicting economic pain on people and corporations carrying debt.\n\nUnfortunately, the more dependent the economy has become on fiscalstimulusoreasy money, the more the more difficult it becomes to wean off of expansionary policy ,and the more vulnerable the economy becomes to a hard landing due to even minor checks on expansionary policy. So, typically, the longer a policy-induced boom in the economy runs or the larger an easy money-fueled market bubble becomes, the more difficult it is for officials to gradually withdraw expansionary policy support to engineer a soft landing.\n\nThis results hard landing, where slowing down or stopping expansionary macroeconomic policy can precipitate a stock market crash, financial crisis, or a collapse of investor confidence. Due torecognition,response, andimplementationlags in macroeconomic policy, these events can spiral into a general recession too quickly for policy makers to mount an effective defense.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, for example, has hiked interest rates at several points in its history at a pace that the market found unpalatable, leading the economy to slow and/or enter a period of recession. Most recently, there was a hard landing in 2007 resulting from the Fed tightening monetary policy to cool the residential real estate market. The fallout was spectacular, with aGreat Recessionrather than just a recession, but it is difficult to imagine how a soft landing could take place when the speculative bubble had grown so large.\n\nThe term hard landing has often been applied to China, which has enjoyed decades of preternaturally highgross domestic product(GDP) growth rates that\u2014to some observers\u2014have set it up for a hard landing. High levels of debt, particularly at the local government level, are often pointed to as a potential catalyst for a downturn, as are high property prices in many Chinese cities.\n\nIn late 2015, following a rapiddevaluationof the yuan and softening trade volumes, many observers feared a Chinese hard landing: Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale put the odds of at 30%.However, trade volumes recovered and currency markets stabilized. In 2019, the talk of a Chinese hard landingresurfacedwith the crackdown onshadow financeand speculation on what the loss of that credit source will do to Chinese businesses, growth, and jobs. Of course, it is worth noting that China has yet to experience a hard landing, while all the western powers predicting it on their behalf have been through a few.\n\nBusiness Insider. \"These Economic 'Swans' Could Rock the Global Markets.\" Accessed May 17, 2021.",
