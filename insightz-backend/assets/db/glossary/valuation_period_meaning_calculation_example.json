  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe valuation period is the interval at the end of a given period of time during which value is determined for variable investment options. Valuation is the calculation of a product\u2019s value and is typically done by appraisers at the end of each business day.\n\nThe valuation period applies to investment products like variable annuities and certain life insurance policies.\n\nAnnuities are financial products that offer investors a source of income during retirement.Variable annuitiesare annuity products that provide payouts and are variable dependent on the value of the annuity's investments. The owner of the annuity can choose their investment products and designate percentages or whole dollar amounts toward the various investment vehicles.\n\nThe contract value of a variable annuity will depend on the performance of its investments.\n\nA variable annuity offers the potential for greater earnings and larger payouts, but because of the day-to-day valuation, variable annuities involve more risk than other kinds of annuities, such as fixeddeferred annuities.\n\nIn thinking about valuation, it\u2019s helpful to understand the process. When it comes to valuation and annuities, there are present and future value formulas.\n\nThepresent value of an annuityis today\u2019s value of future\u00a0payments from an annuity when factoring in a specified rate of return or discount rate. The annuity's\u00a0future cash flows\u00a0are cut at the discount rate. The higher the\u00a0discount\u00a0rate, the lower the\u00a0present value\u00a0of the annuity.\n\nThis calculation relies\u00a0on the concept of thetime value of money, which says that a dollar now is worth more than a dollar earned later. This concept means that receiving money today is worth more than receiving the same amount of money in the future because the money today can be invested at a givenrate of return.\n\nFor example, receiving a lump sum of\u00a0$10,000 today is worth more than getting $1,000 per year for ten years. The lump sum, if invested today, is going to be worth more at the end of the decade than incremental investments of $1,000 each. This is true even if invested at the same rate of\u00a0interest.\n\nKnowing thefuture value(FV) of an ordinary annuity formula is useful when an investor knows how much they can invest per period for a certain time period and wants to find out how much they will have in the future. FV is also useful knowledge when making payments on a loan as it helps to calculate\u00a0the total cost of the loan.\n\nCalculating thefuture value of the annuityrequires calculating the future value of each cash flow over a period of time. Annuities have a number of cash flows. The future value calculation requires taking the value of each cash flow, factoring in the original investment and interest rate, and adding these values together to determine the accumulated future value.\n\nWhen an annuity is valued, the present and future values are calculated. It is important to remember that interest rates and inflation are factored into the calculations.\n\nAnannuity dueis when the payment is required at the beginning of the period. The most common example is when a landlord requires rent to be paid at the beginning of the rental cycle. A different, more complicated example would be awhole life annuity due, where an insurance company requires payments at the beginning of each period, just like the landlord example.\n\nThe main difference between an annuity due and an ordinary annuity is when the payments are required. Annuity due payments are required at the beginning of the period, whereas an ordinary annuity requires the payment at the end. Annuity due payments tend to favor the recipient, as it provides them access to capital at the beginning of the period, which they can then use to invest.\n\nThevaluationof a corporation is different from an annuity valuation. There are many more facets that must be considered when valuing a corporation such as assets, debts, revenues, the potential for expansion, and others. A corporation can be valued to determine a fair stock price, when paying out equity to shareholders, or when entering or considering aliquidity event.\n\nAn annuity period is when the annuity starts making payments to the investor. This is different from theaccumulation periodof an annuity, which is when the investor is making payments on the annuity.",
