The original Keystone pipeline project was abandoned in 2021 but the change in the U.S. presidency in 2025 appears to have reopened the possibility of its construction. Its resumption appears unlikely, however. The original developer has indicated no interest in restarting the project.\n\nPresident Donald Trump granted a permit for the construction of the pipeline in March 2019 during his first term and after years of debate. President Joe Biden then revoked the permit shortly after taking office in January 2021. President Trump rescinded Biden's revocation in a January 2025 order days after taking office for his second term.\n\nThe original Keystone pipeline was proposed by TransCanada Corp in a press release on Feb. 9, 2005.\n\nThe press release said, \"TransCanada is in the business of connecting energy supplies to markets and we view this opportunity as another way of providing a valuable service to our customers. Converting one of our natural gas pipeline assets for oil transportation is an innovative, cost-competitive way to meet the need for pipeline expansions to accommodate anticipated growth in Canadiancrude oilproduction during the next decade.\"\n\nThe first phase of the pipeline went from Hardisty, Alberta to the junction at Steele City, NE then on to the Wood River Refinery in Roxana, IL and the Patoka Oil Terminal Hub north of Patoka, IL.\n\nSection two ran from Steele City, NE south through Kansas to the oil hub and tank farm in Cushing, OK then further south to Nederland, TX to serve refineries in the Port Arthur, TX area.\n\nThe third phase was the Houston Lateral pipeline which would transport crude oil from the pipeline in Liberty County, TX to refineries and terminals in the Houston area.\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced in November 2015 that his administration would not grant additional permits for the construction of this pipeline to further their commitment to fighting climate change.President Trump then signed an executive order\u00a0during his first week in the Oval Office in 2019, clearing the way for the pipeline project.\n\nThe Republican party believed that the construction of the pipeline would create more jobs and provide a boost to the economy. President Biden rescinded the construction permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on Jan. 20, 2021 when he took office after TC Energy said it was stopping construction earlier the same day.\n\nThe initial Keystone system transported dilutedbitumenand synthetic crude oil\u00a0from Alberta through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma to refineries located in Texas, Illinois, and Oklahoma. Canada has large reserves of oil locked in oil sands. This oil is considered heavy oil that requires a different refining process from other types of oil. The Keystone XL pipeline is estimated to be able to carry over 800,000 barrels of oil a day.\n\nThe production of heavy oil releases particulate matter such as soot as well as chemicals including sulfides, hydrogen cyanide, and sulfur.\n\nThe Keystone pipeline has been criticized by environmental groups, politicians, and residents of the states through which the pipeline passes. These groups have raised concerns about the proposed route's proximity to the Sandhill region of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer which provides a significant portion of the water used to water crops in the United States.The bitumen carried by the pipeline to the United States will likely result in higher greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe National Resource Defense Council (NRDC) filed lawsuits in 2017, 2019, and in July of 2020 to stop the construction of the pipeline.Tarsands oilis much thicker and more corrosive than typical crude oil and is more prone to leaks and spills through the pipeline, according to the NRDC. The group stated that the spill in October 2019 resulted in 378,000 gallons of oil spilling in North Dakota.\n\nThe original Keystone pipeline operated from 2010 until 2021. The Keystone XL pipeline would effectively allow it to resume but the original developer has expressed no interest in breathing new life into the project.\n\nThe National Resources Defense Council (NRDA) reported in January 2025 that the U.S. State Department has indicated that tar sands oil emits carbon emissions at a rate 5% to 17% higher than what the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency initially stated at the beginning of the project.\n\nThe NRDA indicates that this would result in an additional 178.3 million metric tons of gas emissions per year and that that\u2019s the equivalent of 38.5 million vehicles or 45.8 coal-fired power plants.\n\nBitumen is typically referred to as asphalt, pitch, or tar and it does share some of the same characteristics. It's a petroleum-based hydrocarbon that can result from the distillation of crude oil.\n\nThe Keystone pipeline was initially launched to transport heavy oil from the oil sands of Canada to U.S. refiners. It almost immediately hit a brick wall of protest due to its anticipated environmental effects. President Biden rescinded its construction permit in January 2021 and the pipeline shut down. President Trump then rescinded the revocation when he took office for his second term in January 2025.\n\nProponents of the pipeline say that it will increase the supply of oil to the United States and that oil coming from a friendly neighboring country will increase security. The pipeline's negative environmental impacts could be serious, however.\n\nEnergyNow.com. \"Trump Order Offers a Chance to Revive Keystone XL Pipeline.\"\n\nNational Resources Defense Council. \"Trump Energy EO and Keystone XL.
