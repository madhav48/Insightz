  "term": "What Is a White Label Product, and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "White label products are sold by retailers with their own branding and logo but the products themselves are manufactured by a third party. White labeling occurs when the manufacturer of an item uses the branding requested by the purchaser or marketer instead of its own. The end product appears as though it's been produced by the purchaser.\n\nWhite label products are manufactured by a third party, not the company that sells them or necessarily even markets them. The advantage is that a single company doesn't have to go through the entire process of creating and selling a product. One firm can concentrate on producing the product, another on marketing it, and another can focus on selling it, each according to its expertise and preference.\n\nThe major benefits of white label branding are that it saves companies time, energy, and money in terms of production and marketing costs.\n\nAnother big advantage ofprivate labelbrands is that the average transportation expenses might be lower than usual and the company would benefit from distributionaleconomies of scaleif a supermarket has an exclusive deal with a manufacturer. The retailer could sell the product for less and still reap a biggerprofit marginbecause of lower transportation costs.\n\nWhite label products may technically appear in any industry or sector but large retailers have done quite well with them. Companies like Whole Foods and Walmart have benefited by selling their own branded products that have been created by other manufacturers. This strategy allows retailers to maintain control over branding, packaging, and pricing while offering consumers exclusive products that align with their brand identity.\n\nPrivate label branding isn't limited to the supermarket segment. Major electronics manufacturers of top-tiermobile phonesand computers often put their brand names on cheaper-priced white label products to expand their offerings.\n\nPrivate label brands have become increasingly popular, suggesting that consumers are becoming more sensitive to price and less loyal to their favorite traditionalbrands.The growth of private label brands is hurting national brands\u2019 and the manufacturers'market sharein many countries.\n\nBeauty and cosmetics brands usually leverage white label products. These brands can collaborate with manufacturers to customize skincare, makeup, and hair care products under their branding.\u00a0For instance, skincare companies may white label anti-aging serums or moisturizers, tailoring formulations and packaging to appeal to their target demographics. However, the skincare company itself would not be responsible for manufacturing the product.\n\nHealth and wellness companies often utilize white label products to offer a broad range of dietary supplements, vitamins, and herbal remedies under their own brand names. By partnering with reputable manufacturers, these companies can ensure the quality and efficacy of their products.\n\nFood and beverage brands often utilize white label products to offer a wide array of private-label goods such as snacks, beverages, condiments, and packaged foods. By partnering with manufacturers, these brands can maintain control over product quality\u00a0as more stringent health-code compliant production plants can generate the food items.\n\nWhite label products don't always have to betangibleitems. Service offerings have also adopted white labeling. Some banks use white label services like credit card processing when they don't have these services in-house. Businesses that have no banking operations often extend branded credit cards to their customers and this is also a form of white labeling. L.L.Bean Inc.offers its consumers a branded Mastercard, and Macy\u2019s (M) offers its customers a branded card. Theirs is provided by American Express (AXP).\n\nThe concept of white labeling comes with numerous considerations, both positive and negative.\n\nThe U.S.-based warehouse club operator Costco (COST) is one large retailer that's being creative with branding with its Kirkland brand of private-label products. Does this mean thatCostcomakes all the Kirkland products you see on the shelves? Not at all. They simply contract with various producers that have agreed to put their products into the Kirkland packaging.\n\nA Kirkland-branded product often sits next to the national brand that makes the product on the shelf: identical products, different names, and the national brand selling at a higher price. Costco sells Saran Wrap. Saran is a trade name owned by S.C. Johnson & Son but Costco also sells its own Kirkland Signature stretch-tite plastic food wrap.\n\nCostco has further blurred the line between national brands and private labels by using premium offerings and co-branding strategies with the likes of Starbucks (SBUX), Quaker Oats, a subsidiary of PepsiCo, Inc.(PEP), and Tyson Foods, Inc. (TSN).\n\nWhite label products are manufactured by one company but branded and sold by another company as their own. This arrangement allows businesses to offer new products without having to invest in the production process.\n\nThe term \"white label\" suggests a blank canvas that can easily be converted to a personalized label.\n\nA tangible product is something you can touch and see before you commit to buying it, unlike an idea, concept, or service. You can gauge its quality by examining it. You generally can't assess the quality of an intangible product like a service until after it's completed.\n\nWhite label products are generic and sold to multiple retailers who rebrand them. In contrast, private label products are made exclusively for a specific retailer, often with customized specifications and designs.\n\nThe costs of white labeling products vary depending on the product type, customization level, and order quantities. Initial costs typically include product development fees, sample costs, and packaging design. There are also production costs, which can include manufacturing, packaging, and labeling expenses.\n\nA white label product bears the branding and logo of a retailer although it\u2019s manufactured by another party. The manufacturer labels the product according to the retailer\u2019s wishes rather than using its own brand or logo. These products are commonly labeled with the retailer\u2019s name although the retailer didn't manufacture them. Both consumer product executives and retail executives tend to believe that co-branding between retailers and traditional national brands is a win-win situation.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Brands Versus Private Labels:\u00a0Fighting to Win.\"\n\nNielsenIQ. \"The Rise of Private Labels: A Global Perspective on Growth and Consumer Trends.\"\n\nNielsonIQ. \"Branded vs. Private Label \u2013 Who Is Going to Come Out on Top?\"\n\nL.L.Bean. \"L.L.Bean Mastercard.\"\n\nAmerican Express Company. \"Macy's American Express Card.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Costco Wholesale Corporation, Form 10-K , for the Fiscal Year Ended September 1, 2024.\" Page 7.",
