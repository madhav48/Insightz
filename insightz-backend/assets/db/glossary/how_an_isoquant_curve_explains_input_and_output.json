  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nAn isoquant curve helps manufacturers adjust their levels of labor and capital to maintain output at the lowest cost.\n\nAn isoquant curve illustrates the relative influence that inputs, commonlycapitaland labor, have on output or production. It helps companies adjust inputs to maintain production and maximize profits\n\nThe isoquant curve displays the combinations of inputs that produce a set amount of output. An isoquant shows combinations of capital and labor and the technological tradeoff between the two: how much capital is required to replace a unit of labor at a certain production point to generate the same output.\n\nLabor is often placed along the X-axis of the isoquant graph and capital along the Y-axis. The exact slope of the isoquant curve on the graph shows the rate at which a given input, either labor or capital, can be substituted for the other while keeping the same output level.\n\nIn the graph below, factor K represents capital and factor L is labor. The curve shows that when a firm moves down from point (a) to point (b) and uses one additional unit of labor, the firm can give up four units of capital (K) and yet remain on the same isoquant at point (b). If the firm hires another unit of labor and moves from point (b) to (c), the firm can reduce its capital (K) by\u00a0three units but remain on the same isoquant.\n\nImage by Julie Bang \u00a9 Investopedia 2019\n\nTo calculate an isoquant, use the formula for themarginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS):\n\nMRTS(L,K)=\u2212\u0394K\u0394L=MPLMPKwhere:K=CapitalL=LaborMP=Marginal\u00a0products\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0input\u0394K\u0394L=Amount\u00a0of\u00a0capital\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0reducedwhen\u00a0labor\u00a0is\u00a0increased\u00a0(typically\u00a0by\u00a0one\u00a0unit)\\begin{aligned} &\\text{MRTS(\\textit{L}, \\textit{K})} = - \\frac{ \\Delta K }{ \\Delta L } = \\frac{ \\text {MP}_L }{ \\text {MP}_K } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &K = \\text{Capital} \\\\ &L = \\text{Labor} \\\\ &\\text{MP} = \\text{Marginal products of each input} \\\\ &\\frac{ \\Delta K }{ \\Delta L } = \\text{Amount of capital that can be reduced}\\\\ &\\text{when labor is increased (typically by one unit)} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bMRTS(L,K)=\u2212\u0394L\u0394K\u200b=MPK\u200bMPL\u200b\u200bwhere:K=CapitalL=LaborMP=Marginal\u00a0products\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0input\u0394L\u0394K\u200b=Amount\u00a0of\u00a0capital\u00a0that\u00a0can\u00a0be\u00a0reducedwhen\u00a0labor\u00a0is\u00a0increased\u00a0(typically\u00a0by\u00a0one\u00a0unit)\u200b\n\nFor example, in the graph of an isoquant where capital (represented with K\u00a0on its Y-axis and labor (represented with L) on its X-axis, the slope of the isoquant, or the MRTS at any one point, is calculated as\u00a0dL/dK.\n\nThe marginal rate of technical substitution shows the rate at which a firm can substitute one input, such as labor, for another input, such as capital, without changing the output.\n\nAn isoquant curve slopes downward or is negatively sloped. This means that the same level of production only occurs when increasing units of input are offset with fewer units of another input factor. This property coincides with the marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS). For example, the same output is achieved when capital inputs increase, but labor inputs decrease.\n\nAn isoquant curve, because of the MRTS effect, is convex to its origin. This indicates that factors of production may be substituted with one another. The increase in one factor must be used in conjunction with the decrease of another input factor.\n\nIsoquant curves cannot be tangent to or intersect one another. Curves that intersect are incorrect and produce invalid results, as a common factor combination on each of the curves will reveal the same level of output, which is impossible.\n\nIsoquant curves in the upper portions of the chart yield higher outputs. At a higher curve, factors of production are more heavily employed. Either more capital or more labor input factors result in greater production.\n\nAn isoquant curve should not touch the X or Y axis on the graph. If it does, the rate of technical substitution is void and indicates that one factor is responsible for producing the given level of output without the involvement of any other input factors.\n\nIsoquant curves do not have to be parallel to one another. The rate of technical substitution between factors may have variations.\n\nIsoquant curves are oval-shaped. This allows firms to determine the most efficient factors of production.\n\nThe isoquant curve is the flip side of anothermicroeconomicmeasure, theindifference curve. The mapping of the isoquant curve addresses cost-minimization problems for producers or the best way to manufacture goods.\n\nThe indifference curve, on the other hand, measures the optimal ways consumers use goods. It attempts to analyze consumer behavior and map out consumer demand.\n\nIt identifies the point at which an individual stops being indifferent to the combination of goods. When plotted on a graph, an indifference curve shows\u00a0a combination of two goods (one on the Y-axis, the other on the X-axis) that gives a consumer equal satisfaction andutility.\n\nAn isoquant, when plotted on a graph, shows all the combinations of two factors that produce a given output. Often used inmanufacturing, with capital and labor as the two factors, isoquants can show the optimal combination of inputs that will produce the maximum output at minimum cost.\n\nThe term \"isoquant\" seems to have been coined by Ragnar Frisch, appearing in his notes for lectures on production theory at the University of Oslo in 1928-29. Whatever its origins, by the late 1930s, the isoquant graph was in widespread use by industrialists and industrial economists.\n\nBoth isocosts and isoquants are curves plotted on a graph. Used by producers and manufacturers, they display the best interplay of two factors that will result in the maximum output at minimum cost. An isoquant shows all combinations of factors that produce a certain output. An isocost shows all combinations of factors that cost the same amount.\n\nThe isoquant curve is a sloping line on a graph that shows the various combinations of inputs that result in the same output. It's a microeconomic metric that businesses use to adjust the relative amounts of capital and labor they need to keep production steady.\n\nLloyd, Peter J. \"The Discovery of the Isoquant.\"History of Political Economy,vol 44, no. 4, 2012, pp. 643-661.",
