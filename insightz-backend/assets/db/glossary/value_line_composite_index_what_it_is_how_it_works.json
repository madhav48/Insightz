  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nThe Value Line Composite Index\u00a0is a\u00a0stock index containing approximately 1,700 companies from theNYSE,American Stock Exchange, Nasdaq, Toronto, and over-the-counter markets.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff The Value Line Composite Index\u00a0has two forms: The Value Line Geometric Composite Index (the original equally weighted index) and the Value Line Arithmetic Composite Index (an index which mirrors changes if a portfolio held equal amounts of stock.) These indexes are typically published in theValue Line Investment Survey, created by Arnold Bernhard, the founder, and CEO of Value Line Inc.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe \"Value Line\" where the index receives its namesake refers to a multiple of cash flow that Bernhard would superimpose over a price chart to normalize the value of different companies.\u00a0Value Line is one of the most respected investment research firms. Its performance record has been extremely strong. In fact, the firm's model portfolios have generally beat the market over thelong run.\n\nThe Value Line Composite Index\u00a0is composed of the same companies as The\u00a0Value Line\u00a0Investment Survey, excluding closed-end funds.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe number of companies in the Value Line\u00a0Index fluctuates based on factors including the addition or delisting of the companies on the exchanges themselves, mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, and the coverage decisions made by Value Line for the Value Line Index. Value Line\u2019s decisions as to which companies to include are undertaken with the intention to create a broad representation of the North American equity market.\u00a0Additionally, the number of companies listed on any given exchange may vary, as a company may move from one exchange to another or be added or delisted. However, delisting or movement of companies on the exchanges are not factors in the Value Line Index methodology, regardless, whether the geometric or arithmetic calculations are\u00a0employed.\n\nThe year that the original Value Line Geometric Composite Index was launched.\n\nThis\u00a0is the original index, introduced on June 30, 1961.\ufeff It is an\u00a0equally weighted index\u00a0using a\u00a0geometric average.\u00a0The daily price change of the Value Line Geometric Composite Index is found by multiplying the ratio of each stock's closing price to its previous closing price and raising that result to the\u00a0reciprocal\u00a0of the total number of stocks.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThis index was established on February 1, 1988, using the arithmetic mean to more closely mimic the change in the index if you held a portfolio of stocks in equal amounts.\ufeff The daily price change of the Value Line Arithmetic Composite Index is calculated by adding the daily percent change of all the stocks and then dividing by the total number of stocks.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-K 2020,\" Page 6.
