  "term": "Joint Venture (JV): What Is It, and Why Do Companies Form One?",
  "definition": "A joint venture (JV) is a business arrangement in which two or more parties agree to pool their resources for the purpose of accomplishing a specific task. This task can be a new project or any other business activity.\n\nEach of the participants in a joint venture is responsible forprofits, losses, and costs associated with it. However, the venture is its own entity, separate from the participants\u2019 other business interests.\n\nAlthough a joint venture is a partnership in the colloquial sense of the word, it can be formed using any legal structure\u2014corporations, partnerships,limited liability companies (LLCs), and other business entities can all be employed.\n\nDespite the fact that the purpose of a JV is typically for production or research, one can also be formed for a continuing purpose. JVs can combine large and small companies to take on one or several projects and deals.\n\nHere are the four main reasons why companies form JVs.\n\nA joint venture can take advantage of the combined resources of both companies to achieve the goal of the venture. One company might have a well-established manufacturing process, while the other company might have superior distribution channels.\n\nBy usingeconomies of scale, both companies in the joint venture can leverage their production at a lower per-unit cost than they would separately. This is particularly appropriate with technological advances that are costly to implement. Other cost savings as a result of a JV can includesharing advertising, business supply, or labor costs.\n\nTwo companies or parties forming a joint venture might each have different backgrounds, skill sets, or expertise. When these are combined through a JV, each company can benefit from the other\u2019s talent.\n\nAnother common use of joint ventures is to partner with a local business to enter a foreign market. A company that wants to expand itsdistribution networkto new countries can enter into a JV agreement to supply products to a local business, thus benefiting from an already-existing distribution network.\n\nSome countries have restrictions on foreigners entering their market, making a JV with a local entity almost the only way to do business in the country.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02020\n\nRegardless of the joint venture structure, the most important document will be the agreement that sets out all of the rights and obligations of each party to the venture.\n\nThe objectives, the initial contributions of the parties, the day-to-day operations, the right to the profits, and the responsibility for losses are all set out in the JV agreement. It is important to draft it with care to avoidrisking litigationdown the road.\n\nA joint venture gives each party the opportunity to exploit a new business opportunity without bearing all of the cost and risk. Joint ventures, by nature, are riskier than \u201cbusiness as usual,\u201d andcoopetition and sharing the riskis a wise move.\n\nIf the right participants are involved, the joint venture also starts out with a broader base of knowledge and pool of talent than any one party possesses on its own.\n\nFor example, a joint entertainment venture set up by an animation studio and a streaming content provider can get off the ground quicker\u2014and probably with a better chance of success\u2014than either participant could alone.\n\nEmbarking on a joint venture requires relinquishing a degree of control. The vital decisions are being made by two or more parties.\n\nThe companies involved must go into the project with the same goals and an equal degree of commitment.\n\nExtreme differences between the participants\u2019 company cultures and management styles can be a barrier to success. Will the executives of an animation studio be able to communicate in the same language as the executives of a digital streaming giant? They might, or they might line up in opposing camps.\n\nSetting up a joint venture multiplies the number of management teams involved. If one party undergoes a significant change in its business structure or executive team, the joint venture can get lost in the shuffle.\n\nWhen forming a joint venture, the most common thing the two parties can do is to set up a new entity. As the JV itself isn\u2019t recognized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the business form between the two parties helps determine how taxes are paid.\n\nAs the JV is a separate entity, it will pay taxes as any other business or corporation does. However, if it chooses to operate as an LLC, its profits and losses would pass through to the owners\u2019 personal tax returns, as with any other LLC.\n\nThe JV agreement will spell out how profits or losses are taxed. If the agreement is merely a contractual relationship between the two parties, then it will determine how the tax is divided between them.\n\nA joint venture is not a partnership. That term is reserved for a single business entity that is formed by two or more people. JVs join two or more different entities into a new one, which may or may not be a partnership.\n\nThe term \u201cconsortium\u201d is sometimes used to describe a JV, and there are similarities. However, a consortium is a more informal agreement than a JV. For example, a consortium of travel agencies can negotiate and give members special rates on hotels and airfares, but it does not create a whole new entity.\n\nThe agencies still pursue their own businesses independently. In a JV, they would share ownership of the created entity, jointly responsible for its risks, profits, losses, and governance.\n\nIn 2022, two large Japanese companies, Sony and Honda, announced a joint venture to create an electric vehicle. Sony is one of the world's most prominent electronics companies and Honda is one of the most prominent automobile companies.\n\nThe established joint venture seeks to bring an electric vehicle to market by 2026 by combining Honda's skills in mobility development, technology, and sales, with that of Sony's expertise in imaging, telecommunication, networks, and entertainment.\n\nThe joint venture is called \"Afeela.\" The company will be taking pre-orders in 2025 with expected delivery in the U.S. in 2026.\n\nThere are many reasons tojoin forces with another companyon a temporary basis, including for purposes of expansion, development of new products, and entering\u00a0new markets (particularly overseas).\n\nJoint ventures are a common method of combining the business prowess, industry expertise, and personnel of two otherwise unrelated companies. This type of partnership allows each participating company an opportunity to scale its resources to complete a specific project or goal while reducing total cost and spreading out the risks and liabilities inherent to the task.\n\nA joint venture affords each party access to the\u00a0resources of the other participant(s) without having to spend excessive amounts of capital. Each company is able to maintain its own identity and can easily return to normal business operations once the JV is complete. JVs also provide the benefit of shared risk.\n\nJoint venture contracts commonly limit the outside activities of participant companies while the project is in progress. Each company involved in a JV may be required to sign exclusivity agreements or anon-compete agreementthat affects current relationships withvendorsor other business contacts.\n\nThe contract under which a JV is created may also expose each company to liability inherent to a partnership unless a separate business entity is established for the JV. Furthermore, while companies participating in a JV share control, work activities and use of resources are not always divided equally.\n\nA joint venture is intended to meet a particular project with specific goals, so it ends when the project is complete. An exit strategy is important, as it provides a clear path on how to dissolve the joint business, avoiding drawn-out discussions, costly legal battles, unfair practices, negative impacts on customers, and controlling for any possible financial loss.\n\nIn most JVs, an exit strategy can come in three different forms: sale of the new business, a spinoff of operations, or employee ownership. Each exit strategy offers different advantages to partners in the JV, as well as the potential for conflict.\n\nA joint venture between companies can open the way for expansion into a new line of business by each participant at a relatively modest cost. In fact, it sounds ideal: Each company contributes its own expertise, but the cost of the venture is split among them.\n\nIt\u2019s only ideal, though, if the companies have a shared vision and an equal commitment to the success of the joint venture.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTax Information for Partnerships.\u201d\n\nAP. \"Japan's Honda, Sony Joining Forces on New Electric Vehicle.\"\n\nCar & Driver. \"Afeela Is a New EV From Sony and Honda Coming to the U.S. in 2026.\"",
