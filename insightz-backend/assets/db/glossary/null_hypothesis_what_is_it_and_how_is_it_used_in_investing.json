  "definition": "A null hypothesis is a statistical assumption suggesting that any observed patterns or differences in a dataset are due to chance and not the result of a meaningful effect.\n\nA null hypothesis is a foundational concept in statistics that assumes there is no real relationship or effect in the data being analyzed, and that any variations or trends are simply the result of random fluctuation rather than a true underlying cause.\n\nHypothesis testingis used to assess the credibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. Sometimes referred to simply as the \u201cnull,\u201d it is represented as H0.\n\nThe null hypothesis, also known as \u201cthe conjecture,\u201d is used inquantitative analysisto test theories about markets, investing strategies, and economies to decide if an idea is true or false.\n\nA gambler may be interested in whether a game of chance is fair. If it is, then the expected earnings per play come to zero for both players. If it is not, then the expected earnings are positive for one player and negative for the other.\n\nTo test whether the game is fair, the gambler collects earnings data from many repetitions of the game, calculates the average earnings from these data, and then tests the null hypothesis that the expected earnings are not different from zero.\n\nIf the average earnings from the sample data are sufficiently far from zero, then the gambler will reject the null hypothesis and conclude the alternative hypothesis\u2014namely, that the expected earnings per play are different from zero. If the average earnings from thesample dataare near zero, then the gambler will not reject the null hypothesis, concluding instead that the difference between the average from the data and zero is explainable by chance alone.\n\nA null hypothesis can only be rejected, not proven.\n\nThe null hypothesis assumes that any kind of difference between the chosen characteristics that you see in a set of data is due to chance. For example, if the expected earnings for the gambling game are truly equal to zero, then any difference between the average earnings in the data and zero is due to chance.\n\nAnalysts look to\u00a0rejectthe null hypothesis because doing so is a strong conclusion. This requires evidence in the form of an observed difference that is too large to be explained solely by chance. Failing to reject the null hypothesis\u2014that the results are explainable by chance alone\u2014is a weakconclusion because it allows that while factors other than chance may be at work, they may not be strong enough for the statistical test to detect them.\n\nAn important point to note is that we are testing the null hypothesis because there is an element of doubt about its validity. Whatever information that is against the stated null hypothesis is captured in the\u00a0alternative (alternate) hypothesis (H1).\n\nFor the examples below, the alternative hypothesis would be:\n\nIn other words, the alternative hypothesis is a direct contradiction of the null hypothesis.\n\nHere is a simple example: A school principal claims that students in their school score an average of seven out of 10 in exams. The null hypothesis is that the populationmeanis not 7.0. To test this null hypothesis, we record marks of, say, 30 students (sample) from the entire student population of the school (say, 300) and calculate the mean of that sample.\n\nWe can then compare the (calculated) sample mean to the (hypothesized) population mean of 7.0 and attempt to reject the null hypothesis. (The null hypothesis here\u2014that the population mean is not 7.0\u2014cannot be proved using the sample data. It can only be rejected.)\n\nTake another example:\u00a0The\u00a0annual return\u00a0of a particularmutual fundis claimed to be 8%. Assume that the mutual fund has been in existence for 20 years. The null hypothesis is that the mean return is not 8% for the mutual fund. We take a random sample ofannual returnsof the mutual fund for, say, five years (sample) and calculate the sample mean. We then compare the (calculated) sample mean to the (claimed) population mean (8%) to\u00a0test the null hypothesis.\n\nFor the above examples, the null hypotheses are:\n\nFor the purposes of determining whether to reject the null hypothesis (abbreviated H0),\u00a0said hypothesis is\u00a0assumed, for the sake of argument, to be true. Then the likely range of possible values of the calculated statistic (e.g., the average score on 30 students\u2019 tests) is determined under this presumption (e.g., the range of plausible averages might range from 6.2 to 7.8 if the population mean is 7.0).\n\nIf the sample average is outside of this range, the null hypothesis is rejected. Otherwise, the difference is said to be \u201cexplainable by chance alone,\u201d being within the range that is determined by chance alone.\n\nTraditional null hypothesis testing, consisting of a comparative statistical test for two competing theories, was suggested by Ronald Fisher in 1925.\n\nAs an example related to\u00a0financial markets, assume Alice sees that her investment strategy produces higher average returns than simplybuying and holding a stock. The null hypothesis states that there is no difference between the two average returns, and Alice is inclined to believe this until she can conclude contradictory results.\n\nRefuting the null hypothesis would require showingstatistical significance, which can be found by a variety of tests. The alternative hypothesis would state that the investment strategy has a higher average return than a traditional buy-and-hold strategy.\n\nOne tool\u00a0that can determine the statistical significance of the results is the p-value. Ap-valuerepresents the probability that a difference as large or larger than the observed difference between the two average returns could occur solely by chance.\n\nA p-value that is less than or equal to 0.05 often indicates whether there is evidence against the null hypothesis. If Alice conducts one of these tests, such as a test using the normal model, resulting in a significant difference between her returns and the buy-and-hold returns (the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05), she can then reject the null hypothesis and conclude the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe analyst or researcher establishes a null hypothesis based on the research question or problem they are trying to answer. Depending on the question, the null may be identified differently. For example, if the question is simply whether an effect exists (e.g., does X influence Y?), the null hypothesis could be H0: X = 0. If the question is instead, is X the same as Y, the H0would be X = Y. If it is that the effect of X on Y is positive, H0would be X > 0. If the resulting analysis shows an effect that isstatistically significantly differentfrom zero, the null hypothesis can be rejected.\n\nInfinance, a null hypothesis is used in quantitative analysis. It tests the premise of an investing strategy, the markets, or an economy to determine if it is true or false.\n\nFor instance, an analyst may want to see if two stocks, ABC and XYZ, are closely correlated. The null hypothesis would be ABC \u2260 XYZ.\n\nStatistical hypothesesare tested in a four-step process. The first is for the analyst to state the two hypotheses so that only one can be right. The second is to formulate an analysis plan, which outlines how the data will be evaluated. The third is to carry out the plan and physically analyze the sample data. The fourth and final step is to analyze the results and either reject the null hypothesis or claim that the observed differences are explainable by chance alone.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis is a direct contradiction of a null hypothesis. This means that if one of the two hypotheses is true, the other is false.\n\nA null hypothesis states there is no difference between groups or a relationship between variables. It is a type of statistical hypothesis and proposes that no statistical significance exists in a set of given observations. \u201cNull\u201d means nothing.\n\nThe null hypothesis is used in quantitative analysis to test theories about economies, investing strategies, and markets to decide if an idea is true or false. Hypothesis testing assesses the credibility of a hypothesis by using sample data. It is represented as H0and is sometimes simply known as \u201cthe null.\u201d\n\nCorrection\u2014July 23, 2024:This article was corrected to state accurate examples of the null hypothesis.\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"Current Controversies: Null Hypotheses in Statistical Testing.\"",
