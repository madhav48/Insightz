  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA gate provision refers to a statement in a fund's\u00a0offering documents that establishes the fund manager\u2019s right to limit or haltredemptions. Theprospectusor offering documents\u00a0may provide more detail on a gate provision, such as scenarios where redemptions would be restricted or halted entirely.\n\nGate provisions are intended to stop arun on a fund, particularly when the assets a fund holds areilliquidand difficult to turn to cash for redemption in a timely manner. Even with scenarios and guidelines, the decision to exercise the gate provision is the fund managers.\n\nGate provisions restrict redemptions and help to prevent runs on the fund. When a fund, particularly a hedge fund, is\u00a0holding complex investment products, unwinding positions can take time. The gate provision is built into the fund offering to prevent a situation where redemption requests cost the fund further by forcing liquidation in an adverse market situation.\n\nFund managers usually need to inform investors in writing when invoking the gate provision. The notification will usually state the need for the provision and outline how much, if any, investors will be able to receive when they request a redemption. Even though they are part of most fund documents, invoking the gate provision is a serious business and usually involves a consultation with an attorney. Because a gate provision is invoked at the discretion of the fund manager, investors who find their money locked in understandably question the fund manager\u2019s judgment.\n\nInterestingly, a gate provision doesn't always affect all investors equally.Institutional investorsand preferred clients may have a side letter\u2014a separate agreement with the fund\u2014stating that their money will never be locked in. As a result, some hedge funds have eliminated gate provisions altogether because it doesn't actually cover the majority of the capital in the fund.\n\nWhen a fund enacts a gate provision, it is generally seen as a negative event. There have been cases, however, where a fund manager has used the gate provision to make certain that the capital is intact to carry out a critical phase of the strategy.\n\nOne such situation was popularized in the film \"The Big Short,\" when Michael Burry invoked a gate provision to halt redemptions so that his bet against the housing market wouldn't be liquidated until the mortgage meltdown occurred. His investors enjoyed massive profits after the gate provision was invoked. However, by all accounts, it was extremely unpleasant for all involved when the gate provision was announced.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
