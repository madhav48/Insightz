  "term": "Valoren Number: What it Means, How it Works",
  "definition": "A valoren number is an\u00a0identification number assigned to financial instruments in Switzerland. These numbers are similar to theCUSIP numbersthat are used in Canada and the U.S. A typical valoren number is between six to nine digits in length.\n\nA valoren number is a numeric code that intrinsically has no meaning. When a new valoren\u00a0is needed, the next one from the list is simply allocated. An instrument's number indicates nothing about the instrument itself.\u00a0Market data firms and other financial institutions throughout Europe typically refer to Swiss companies and/or store trade data on these companies using valoren numbers as a means of security identification. UnlikeISINs or CUSIPs, valoren numbers\u00a0have\u00a0no data implanted in the numbers.\n\nSwiss Valoren numbers\u00a0are issued by SIX Financial Information, a subsidiary of SIX Group, a\u00a0multinational\u00a0financial data vendor\u00a0based\u00a0in\u00a0Zurich, Switzerland. The company also has offices in over 20 countries.\u00a0The company provides\u00a0market data,\u00a0which it gathers from the world's major trading venues directly and in real-time. Its database has structured and encoded securities administration data for more than 20 million financial instruments.\n\nSIX Financial Information was originally called Telekurs.\u00a0In 1996, the firm was restructured into a holding company, and it launched an expansion of its product range. In 2007, Telekurs acquired part of the Fininfo Group. In 2008, The Telekurs Group merged with SWX Group, SIS Swiss Financial Services Group, and SEGA Intersettle to form SIX Group. Telekurs Financial was renamed to SIX Telekurs and became the Financial Information division of SIX Group.\u00a0On April 23, 2012, the use of the\u00a0\"Telekurs\" name\u00a0was phased out.\n\nA valoren number can be used for a number of purposes in identifying a\u00a0financial instrument. Globally, a valoren\u00a0number is allocated for any type of\u00a0financial instrument\u00a0which meets the allocation rules.\u00a0It can be used in conjunction with the\u00a0Market Identifier Code\u00a0(MIC) and the\u00a0currency code\u00a0to uniquely identify a traded instrument. It can also be used in transaction reporting and for position keeping.\n\nIn\u00a0Switzerland\u00a0and\u00a0Liechtenstein,\u00a0the valoren\u00a0number is the main identifier in the Swiss Value Chain; it is used as the main identifier by financial institutions throughout the region and beyond. Valoren numbers\u00a0for derivatives may be reused after the derivative expires.",
