  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nA contingency is a potential occurrence of a negative event in the future, such as an economic recession, natural disaster, fraudulent activity,\u00a0terrorist attack, or a pandemic.\n\nAlthough contingencies can be prepared for, the nature and scope of such negative events are typically unknowable in advance. Companies and investors plan for various contingencies through analysis and implementing protective measures.\n\nIn finance, managers often attempt to identify and plan using predictive models for possible contingencies that they believe may occur. Financial managers tend to err on the conservative side to mitigate risk, assuming slightly worse-than-expected outcomes.\n\nA contingency plan might include arranging a company's affairs so that it can weather negative outcomes with the least distress possible.\n\nTo plan for contingencies, financial managers may often also recommend setting aside significant reserves of cash so that the company has strong liquidity, even if it meets with a period of poor sales or unexpected expenses.\n\nManagers may seek to proactively open credit lines while a company is in a strong financial position to ensure access to borrowing in less favorable times. For example, pending litigation would be considered acontingent liability. Contingency plans typically include insurance policies that cover losses that may arise during and after a negative event.\n\nHowever, insurance policies may not cover all of the costs or every scenario. For example,business interruption insurancedoesn't usually cover pandemics, which many businesses suffered through as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Federal government had to step in and pass theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which provided financial relief to businesses, families, and local governments to stem the economic hardship caused by the pandemic. In particular, thePaycheck Protection Program(PPP) offered $349 billion in aid to small businesses to help them maintain their payroll and expenses.\n\nInsurance companies might also limit coverage or put exclusions in place for an act of God, which is an exogenous event, meaning outside of human control, such as a flood or an earthquake. Also, insurance can't replace the customers that were lost to competitors due to an event, particularly if it was an internal systems issue such as a data breach.\n\nAs a result, businesses need to have contingency plans established to help minimize the lost revenue and increased costs that are involved when business operations have been disrupted. Typically, business consultants are hired to ensure contingency plans consider a large number of possible scenarios and provide advice on how to best execute the plan.\n\nContingency plans are utilized by corporations, governments, investors, and central banks, such as the Fed. Contingencies can involve real estate transactions, commodities, investments, currency exchange rates, and geopolitical risks.\n\nContingencies might also includecontingent assets, which are benefits (rather than losses) that accrue to a company or individual given the resolution of some uncertain event in the future. A favorable ruling in a lawsuit or an inheritance would be an example of contingent assets.\n\nContingency plans might involve purchasing insurance policies that pay cash or a benefit if a particular contingency occurs. For example, property insurance might be purchased to protect against fire or wind damage.\n\nInvestors protect themselves from contingencies that could lead to financial losses related to investing. Investors might employ varioushedgingstrategies such asstop-lossorders, which exit a position at a specific price level.\n\nHedging can also involve usingoptionsstrategies,\u00a0which is akin to buying insurance whereby the strategies earn money as an investment position loses money from a negative event.\n\nThe money earned from the options strategy completely or partially offsets the losses from the investment. However, these strategies come at a cost, usually in the form of a premium, which is an upfront cash payment.\n\nInvestors also employasset diversification, which is the process of investing in various types of investments. Asset diversification helps to minimize risk if one asset class, such as stocks, declines in value.\n\nContingent immunizationis a type of contingency plan used in fixed-income investing. It involves the fund manager switching to a defensive position if the portfolio drops below a predetermined value.\n\nAs part of a contingency plan for disasters, such as a pandemic, companies need to plan ahead to ensure that the business can operate during and after an event. This type of contingency plan is often called abusiness continuity plan(BCP) or abusiness recoveryplan.\n\nTypically, a business continuity team is formed to plan for any possible contingencies and manage the continuity and recovery planduring a disruption. Businesses need to identify theircritical business functionsand perform an analysis of how an event might impact the company's operations and processes.\n\nThe contingency plan would include implementing the recovery of critical business functions such as systems, production, and employee access to technology such as computers.\n\nFor example, a contingency plan for a pandemic would include developing a remote work strategy to help prevent the spread of disease and provide employees with secure access to their work.\n\nAs a result, companies would need to invest in technology, which could include providing laptops and video-conferencing access to employees, creating cloud-based data storage, and facilitating access to company-wide communications such as email and internal data.\n\nWith any type of disaster, cybercriminals often try to take advantage of a crisis to hack into a company\u2019s systems and steal data or disrupt business operations. Contingency plans are used to outline the procedures forcybersecurityteams to protect an organization from threats and malicious attacks.\n\nA contingency plan should also prepare for the loss of intellectual property through theft or destruction. As a result, backups of critical files and computer programs, as well as key company patents, should be maintained in a secure off-site location.\n\nContingency plans need to prepare for the possibility of operational mishaps, theft, and fraud. A company should have an emergency public relations response relating to possible events that have the ability to severely damage the company\u2019s reputation and its ability to conduct business.\n\nHow a company is reorganized after a negative event should be included in a contingency plan. It should have procedures outlining what needs to be done to return the company to normal operations and limit any further damage from the event.\n\nFor example, financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald was able to resume operation in just days after being crippled by the 9/11 terrorist attacks due to having a comprehensive contingency plan in place.\n\nA thorough contingency plan minimizes loss and damage caused by an unforeseen negative event. For example, a brokerage company may have a backup power generator to ensure that trades can be executed in the event of a power failure, preventing possible financial loss.\n\nA contingency plan can also reduce the risk of a public relations disaster. A company that effectively communicates how negative events are to be navigated and responded to is less likely to suffer reputation damage.\n\nA contingency plan often allows a company affected by a negative event to keep operating. For example, a company may have a provision in place for possible industrial action, such as a strike, so obligations to customers are not compromised.\n\nCompanies that have a contingency plan in place may obtain better insurance rates and credit availability because they are seen to have reduced business risks.\n\nAs a result of the financial crisis of 2008 and theGreat Recession, regulations were implemented requiring bank stress tests to be performed to test how a bank might handle various negative contingencies. The stress tests project how much a bank would lose\u2014if a negative economic event occurred\u2014to determine if the bank has enough capital or funds set aside to survive the event.\n\nBanks are required to have a specific percentage of capital reserves on hand, depending on the totalrisk-weighted assets(RWAs). These assets, which are typically loans, have various risk weightings applied to them.\n\nFor example, a bank's mortgage portfolio might receive a 50% weighting, meaning the bank\u2014in a negative scenario\u2014should have enough capital that's valued at 50% of the outstanding mortgage loans.\n\nThe capital, calledTier-1 capital, can include equity shares or shareholders' equity\u00a0and retained earnings, which are accumulated savings of prior years' profits. Although there are various components that go into the tier-capital ratio requirement, the ratio has to be at least 6% of the total risk-weighted assets.\n\nLet's say as an example, Bank XYZ has\u00a0$3 million in retained earnings and $4 million in shareholders' equity, meaning the total tier-1 capital is $7 million. Bank XYZ has risk-weighted assets of $70 million. As a result, the bank's tier-1 capital ratio is 10% ($7 million/$70 million). Since the capital requirement is 6%, the bank is considered well-capitalized when compared to the minimum requirement.\n\nOf course, we won't know if the banking sector's contingency plan will be adequate until another recession occurs, which is a limitation of these plans since it's difficult to plan for every contingency.\n\nBusinesses that are at risk for environmental accidents\u2013particularly spills of hazardous materials\u2013should always have a plan in place detailing their response actions. Being prepared can help minimize the total damage done to the environment, minimize accident-related costs, and limit liability.\n\nContingency theory is an approach to management that suggests the best way to run an organization is dependent, or contingent, on that particular situation. In other words, a specific management style can work well in one company and fail completely in another one.\n\nTo create a contingency plan, first, identify the key risks to your business and order them in regard to the likelihood of occurring and severity. Next, conduct a business impact analysis (BIA). From there, start shaping your plan, which should include preventive controls, an incidence response plan, a disaster recovery plan, and a business continuity plan. Make sure to provide training to employees, frequent testing, and updating of your plan.\n\nA contingency is a potentially negative future event or circumstance, such as a global pandemic, natural disaster, or terrorist attack. By designing plans that take contingencies into account, companies, governments, and individuals are able to limit the damage done by such events.\n\nU.S. Congress. \"H.R.748 - CARES Act.\"\n\nCornell Law School. \"Minimum Capital Requirements.\"",
