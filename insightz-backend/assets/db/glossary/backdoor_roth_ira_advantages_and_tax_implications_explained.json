  "definition": "A backdoor IRA is a legal strategy that allows high-income earners to bypass income limits on Roth IRA contributions.\n\nThe backdoor Roth IRA is a maneuver that allows high earners to contribute indirectly to a Roth IRA when their incomes disqualify them from making direct contributions. The process involves making a nondeductibletraditional IRAcontribution followed by a traditional-to-Roth IRA conversion.\n\nThe backdoor Roth individual retirement account (IRA) strategy makes it possible for higher earners to reap the benefits ofRoth IRAs, which include tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals of earnings in retirement that meet certain timing requirements (basically, once you reach at least age 59 \u00bd and once your Roth IRA is at least five years old), and penalty-free withdrawals of contributions at any time. The backdoor Roth IRA 2025 maximum annual contribution limit is $7,000, plus $1,000 if you\u2019re 50 years old or older, unchanged from 2024.\n\nIf not for the backdoor Roth IRA, your Roth IRA contribution annual contribution maximum could be further limited by yourmodified adjusted gross income(MAGI). Most of the thresholds change each year:\n\nThe backdoor Roth IRA is a four-step process:\n\nChoose your favorite brokerage firm, where you\u2019ll open a new traditional IRA.\n\nIn addition to the $7,000 (or $8,000, if you\u2019re at least 50 years old) maximum annual contribution limit in 2024 and 2025, your contribution is also limited to yourearned income\u2014generally, money you earned from working\u2014in the year of contribution. If you have little or no earned income for the year, you may be able to boost yourIRA contribution based on your spouse\u2019s earned income.\n\nYou\u2019ll owe income tax on any earnings accrued before the traditional IRA funds are converted to Roth. Most IRA contributions initially land in an interest-bearing cash account, so delaying the final step can inadvertently lead to a tax bill and cause an unnecessary headache. After this point, you\u2019re free to begin investing your contributions.\n\nUnless you fileForm 8606, the IRS will assume you made a taxable traditional-to-Roth conversion based on two forms your brokerage account will submit on your behalf: Form 1099-R,Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement or Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc.,and Form 5498,IRA Contribution Information. The purpose of Form 8606 is to let the IRS know that your traditional IRA contribution in step No. 2 was nondeductible and therefore not subject to income tax upon conversion in step No. 3.\n\nThe first three steps can be completed at any time before the original due date of your tax return\u2014typically April 15 of the following year. You can complete a backdoor Roth IRA each year.\n\nThe cash you contribute in step No. 2 is post-tax, meaning that you\u2019ll pay income tax on that money in the year you earned it. If you execute the backdoor Roth IRA rules correctly, the process shouldn\u2019t cause any additional current-year taxes, and if you follow theRoth IRA withdrawal rules, you won\u2019t need to pay income taxes on your Roth IRA funds in the future.\n\nPeople run into unintended backdoor Roth IRA tax consequences when they have existing traditional IRA funds, including SIMPLE IRAs, SEP IRAs, and401(k) funds that were rolled over into an IRA. That\u2019s because of the backdoor Roth IRA pro-rata rule, which treats all your non-Roth IRAs as one.\n\nLet\u2019s say you have a traditional IRA with a pre-tax $15,000 balance. You then open a separate traditional IRA, make a post-tax, nondeductible $5,000 contribution, and do a backdoor Roth conversion. Under the pro-rata rule, the IRS considers the conversion as coming proportionally from all non-Roth IRA balances. The combined balances total $20,000. Of that, $15,000 is 75%. So, 75% is considered pre-tax and taxable. As a result, the taxable amount is 75% of the $5,000, or $3,750. (The actual tax bill will depend on your marginal tax rate, which is applied to that $3,750.\n\nThe Backdoor Roth IRA isa fairly simple wayto maximize your Roth retirement funds. Unlike a Roth 401(k), which is only available to those whose employers offer it, anyone with earned income (or a spouse with earned income) can invest through a Roth IRA. Plus, if you follow the rules, Roth contributions and their growth won\u2019t be taxed again. That feature can be particularly helpful for retirees, who may want to keep their taxable income low to avoid triggering higher Social Security taxes or Medicare premiums based on their MAGI.\n\nWhat\u2019s the downside of the backdoor Roth IRA? They can feel onerous the first few times you do it. Mistakes during the four-step process can create taxable events that can\u2019t be easily reversed. And people with existing non-Roth IRAs can\u2019t do a backdoor Roth IRA without triggering the pro-rata rule and generating a potentially hefty tax bill.\n\nSome taxpayers who are ineligible to deduct IRA contributions use after-tax dollars to fund a traditional IRA and pay taxes again when withdrawing from the account just to have an IRA.\n\nThe backdoor Roth IRA strategy is for people whosehigh income limits or disqualifythem from making direct Roth IRA contributions. It\u2019s easy to stay within the rules and avoid tax complications, especially once you know which potential pitfalls such as the pro-rata rule to avoid.\n\nHowever, there is at least one even simpler way for high earners to access a Roth investment account. Many employers offer a Roth 401(k) option to employees of any income level. The Roth 401(k) contribution ceilings are the same as those for a traditional 401(k): $23,500 in 2025 and $23,000 in 2024, with an additional catch-up contribution limit available to those who are at least 50 years old.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have access to\u2014or have more to give after maxing out\u2014a 401(k), it might be time to look into a backdoor Roth IRA.\n\nWhen to avoid the backdoor Roth IRA? First, don\u2019t go through the hassle of a backdoor Roth IRA if your income allows you to make direct Roth IRA contributions. Second, talk to a credentialed tax advisor first if you have any existing non-Roth IRA accounts, including a traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA, or SEP IRA.\n\nOrder your copy of Investopedia'sWhat To Do With $10,000 magazinefor more wealth-building advice.\n\nLet\u2019s say you are a single filer. Let\u2019s also suppose that your 2024 MAGI is $180,000. Your deadline for 2024 Roth IRA contributions is April 15, 2025. But your income is too high to make direct Roth IRA contributions. Let\u2019s further assume you\u2019ve already maxed out contributions to an employer-sponsored Roth 401(k). So your only option for kicking in money to a Roth retirement savings account is to use the backdoor Roth IRA strategy.\n\nHere are the steps you should take:\n\nOn March 15, 2025, you open a traditional IRA at your brokerage firm.\n\nYou contribute $7,000\u2014your backdoor Roth IRA limit as a 30-year-old for 2024\u2014to the traditional IRA.\n\nYour brokerage firm should allow you to make the conversion with a few clicks. You then select your Roth IRA investments, whether they are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds. Still, a word of caution. While the IRS allows conversion immediately after making your post-tax-nondeductible contribution to a traditional IRA, IRA expert Ed Slott tells Investopedia that he urges clients to wait 30 days, so the transactions appear on different statements, if you ever need to prove the contribution and conversion were separate.\n\nYourtax prep softwareshould prompt you to fill out Form 8606, finalizing your backdoor Roth IRA maneuver.\n\nThe backdoor Roth IRA strategy helps countless high earners access the benefits of the Roth IRA. When executed carefully and properly, it allows you to stow away thousands of dollars each year in an account that provides tax-free growth, tax-free withdrawals in retirement, and more.\n\nCongress.gov. \"Tax Cuts And Jobs Act,\" see footnotes 268, 269, 276 and 277, pages 303 and 304.\"",
