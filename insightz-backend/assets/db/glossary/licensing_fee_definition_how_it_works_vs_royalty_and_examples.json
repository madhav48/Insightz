  "term": "Licensing Fee: Definition, How It Works, vs. Royalty, and Examples",
  "definition": "A licensing fee is money paid to buy specific rights from another party. For example, this fee may be paid to a government agency by people or companies for the privilege of offering professional services or engaging in a specific type of business.\n\nIn other cases, licensing fees are paid for the right to useintellectual property, such as patents, trademarks, or copyrights, owned by another person or entity.\n\nMany professions require licenses before a person can perform the work in that field. These licenses are usually granted after the individual has passed a certification exam and completed a required amount of training.\n\nFor example, licenses are required to become a professional in many fields, including:\n\nOnce licensed, an individual is known as alicensee. To maintain their licenses, they may need to take additional exams, complete further training, or pay ongoing fees. Their license can be revoked if the licensee violates legal standards or thecode of ethicsin their profession.\n\nLicensing fees are designed to ensure that professionals in these fields have the necessary skills and follow ethical guidelines, which helps protect the public.\n\nState governments often issue these licenses, and individuals looking to do business in multiple states may have to obtain a license from each one. For example,life insurance agentsusually hold a license in their home state, or the one where their business is based, but they can also obtain nonresident licenses to do business in other states through reciprocity agreements.\n\nBeyond state-level licensing, the federal government also requires certain businesses to pay licensing fees. For example, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission charges licensing fees to commercial nuclear power plant operators.TheFederal Communications Commission (FCC)imposes fees on radio and television broadcasters, among other industries that are regulated at the federal level.\n\nProfessional licensing aims to guarantee that people or businesses engaged in a certain trade or selling specific products are qualified and knowledgable. It also provides the public with the confidence in these professionals. Finally, licensing fees also serve as arevenuesource for government agencies.\n\nFor example, a CPA is an important position as that individual can audit state and local governments and, in some cases, protect the public from financial crimes. A notable example: CPAs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who unraveled complex, illegal financial transactions, such as mobster Al Capone's conviction for tax evasion.\n\nThe licensing fee for CPAs is vital as it ensures that these professionals adhere to rigorous standards of expertise and ethics, essential for handling sensitive financial information and protecting public interests in various high-stakes scenarios.\n\nHowever, the costs associated with licensing fees, along with the time and investment required for the necessary training, can createbarriers to entryinto licensed occupations. For example, hairdressers must pay a licensing fee and obtain a cosmetology license to legally operate, which in turn can increase the cost of their services.\n\nThese requirements for professional licensing are meant to ensure quality and provide the public with confidence in those professions. Some may argue that weakening licensing requirements or reducing fees could put the public at risk.But licensing fees may also inadvertently limit the number of professionals entering certain fields and lead to a shortage in certain services.\n\nHistorical events have influenced professional licensing. The collapse of the St. Francis Dam in California in 1928, which resulted in over 500 fatalities, was pivotal in initiating the licensing of professional engineers in these states.The dam collapse was attributed to poor engineering and human errors and led to licensing requirements.\n\nA licensing fee can also refer to a sum paid to use intellectual property of various kinds, such as acopyrighted work, like a photograph or a logo, that is owned by someone else.\n\nFor example, a T-shirt company that wants to sell shirts imprinted with a certain Major League Baseball team\u2019s logo would need to pay a licensing fee to get Major League Baseball\u2019s permission and possibly the permission of the team itself.\n\nA television or movie company wanting to use a particular song in its soundtrack might have to pay for multiple licenses. According to the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), which licenses more than 18 million songs and scores, the producer would need to obtain a synchronization license for \u201cthe right to synchronize a song or a piece of music with your visual image. It must be obtained from the copyright owner of the music, which is usually the publisher.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the company would need to obtain a master use license for the \u201cright to reproduce a specific recording of a song\u201d from the relevant music label.\n\nIn one notably expensive example, the producers of \u201cMad Men\u201d reportedly paid about $250,000 to license the Beatles song \u201cTomorrow Never Knows,\u201d so that the character Don Draper could listen to it in one scene.\n\nRoyaltiesare ongoing, usage-based payments for the right to use an asset or a property. They are generally calculated as apercentage of gross revenueor net profit. Licensing fees, by contrast, are usually a fixed amount.\n\nSome businesses pay both licensing fees and royalties. For example, afranchiseemight pay the parent franchiser an initial license fee for the right to use the franchise\u2019s name and processes plus regular royalties based on sales. Those royalties often average 5% to 9% annually, depending on thefranchise.\n\nAs the World International Property Organization, a United Nations agency, defines it, intellectual property refers to \u201ccreations of the mind, such as inventions; literary and artistic works; designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce.\u201d The legal ownership of intellectual property is protected by trademarks, copyrights, and patents.\n\nProfessional licensing fees are usually tax deductible. However, some licensing fees may beamortizedover 180 months. Amortized fees include the cost of acquiring or renewing a liquir license, TV or radio broadcasting license, or taxicab medallion.\n\nFor education costs to be tax deductible, you must already be working in that field and show either that the education maintains or improves required skills for your profession or is required by regulations. Education expenses that are necessary to meet the minimum requirements of your present procession aren't tax deductible.\n\nPeople or businesses often pay these fees to government agencies to practice a profession or conduct a particular business. Licensing fees ensure that professionals meet necessary standards, thereby protecting public safety. For intellectual property, licensing fees are paid to use copyrighted, trademarked, or patented material.\n\nLicensing fees can help maintain safety and professional standards, but they can also create barriers to entry in certain professions. This can result in fewer available services and increased costs for customers. When it comes to intellectual property, licensing fees enable the legal use of creative works and protect the work of artists, though they also increase costs for businesses seeking to use these works.\n\nAlliance for Responsible Professional Licensing. \"Fast Facts.\"\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners. \u201cState Licensing Handbook,\u201d Page 17 (Page 24 of PDF).\n\nU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. \u201cLicense Fees.\u201d\n\nFederal Communications Commission. \u201cHow to Apply for a Radio or Television Broadcast Station.\u201d\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation. \"Famous Cases and Criminals: Al Capone.\"\n\nAlliance for Responsible Professional Licensing. \"What's at Risk?\"\n\nAlliance for Responsible Professional Licensing. \"Fast Facts.\"\n\nAssociation of State Dam Safety Officials. \"St. Francis Dam (California, 1928).\"\n\nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. \"About Us.\"\n\nAmerican Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers. \u201cHow to Acquire Music for Films.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \u201cHow Much \u2018Mad Men\u2019 Paid for the Beatles.\u201d\n\nFranNet. \u201cFranchise Royalty Fees Explained.\u201d\n\nWorld International Property Organization. \u201cWhat Is Intellectual Property?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 535 (2022), Business Expenses.\u201d",
