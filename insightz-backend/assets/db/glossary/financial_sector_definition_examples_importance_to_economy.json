This\u00a0sector comprises a broad range of industries including banks, investment companies, insurance companies, and real estate firms.\n\nThe health of the economy depends, in large part, on the strength of its financial sector. The stronger it is, the healthier the economy. A weak financial sector typically means the economy is weakening.\n\nMany people equate the financial sector withWall Streetand the exchanges that operate on it. But there's much more to it than that. The financial sector is one of the most important parts of many developed economies.

If these activities are restricted, it stunts growth in both small businesses and real estate.\n\nFinancial stocksare very popular investments to own within a portfolio.
