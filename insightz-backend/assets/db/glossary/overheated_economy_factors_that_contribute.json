  "term": "Overheated Economy: Factors That Contribute",
  "definition": "An overheated economy is one that has experienced\u00a0a prolonged period of goodeconomic growthand activity that has led to high levels ofinflation, triggered by increased consumer wealth.\n\nA sharp rise in prices causes inefficient supply allocations as producers overproduce and create excess production capacity in an attempt tocapitalizeon the high levels of wealth. Unfortunately, these inefficiencies and inflation will eventually hinder the economy's growth and can often be a precursor to\u00a0arecession.\n\nSimply put, an overheated economy is one that is expanding at a rate that is unsustainable. There are two main signs of an overheating economy\u2014rising rates of inflation and an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for an economy.\n\nRising inflation is typically one of the first signs that an economy is overheating. As a result, governments andcentral bankswill usually raise interest rates in an attempt to lower the amount of spending and borrowing. While central banks can combat rising inflation through interest rate increases, they can often come too late. Because inflation is a lagging indicator, it can take a while for changes in policy to reduce the rate.\n\nBetween June 2004 and June 2006, theFederal Reserve Board (FRB)increased the interest rate 17 times as a gradual means of slowing America's overheated economy.However, two years later, U.S. inflation hit 5.6 percent, a cycle high. This rapid rise in prices was followed by a crippling recession, which saw inflation plunge below zero within six months.\n\nThe second sign of an overheating economy is an unemployment rate that is below the normal rate for a country.Full employmentshould be a good thing. But full employment also means higher inflation since everyone has a job (meaning productivity is at an all-time high) and money to spend.\n\nSince World War II, the unemployment rate generally fell below 5% in the years immediately preceding recessions. That includes the years leading up to theGreat Recession.\n\nOther characteristics of overheated economies include abnormally high levels of consumer confidence followed by a sharp reversal.\n\nThe two main signs outlined above are also causes of an overheating economy. Other causes of an overheating economy includeasset bubblesand external economic shocks. An example of the latter are the oil shocks that occurred during much of the 1970s and 1980s. They resulted in recessions of varying periods and intensity as America's oilimportbill grew to meet increased demand for gasoline.\n\nAsset bubbles are an unsustainable increase in prices for certain assets. This is a sign of overheating. The bursting of thedotcom bubblein 2001 resulted in a recession. More recently, the 2008 financial crisis was the result of a bubble in real estate mortgages. The bubble had wide-reaching implications across geographies and resulted in a prolonged recession that spanned multiple geographies.\n\nThe Great Recession during the late 2000s was preceded by an overheating economy. The unemployment rate continuously fell until 2007, culminating at a rate of 4.6% (below the normal rate) in that year.Meanwhile, the interest rate, which had been steadily rising, peaked at 5.25% in 2006, whenBen Bernankebecame the Fed Chair and right before the crisis.Inflation also peaked at 4.3% at the same time.\n\nAnother sign of a U.S. economy that was overheating was the real estate asset bubble that burst in 2007 and sent shock waves through the entire U.S. financial ecosystem. Compounding these problems was the government's spending. During President Clinton's years, the federal budget had a surplus.However, President Bush's tax cuts converted that surplus into a deficit.\n\nIn 2005, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that there would be a budget deficit of $368 billion that year and it would be followed by a deficit of $295 billion the next year. In short, the U.S. economy demonstrated the hallmarks of an overheating economy in the years leading up to the recession.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Policy Tools: Open Market Operations.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"12-Month Percentage Change, Consumer Price Index, Selected Categories (Past 20 Years).\"\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. \"Business Cycle Dating.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Oil Shock of 1973\u201374.\"\n\nThe Brookings Institution. \"What Iran\u2019s 1979 Revolution Meant for US and Global Oil Markets.\"\n\nThe White House: Clinton Administration. \"President Clinton: The Largest Budget Surplus and Debt Pay-Down in History.\"\n\nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities. \"The Legacy of the 2001 and 2003 'Bush' Tax Cuts.\"\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office. \"The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2006 to 2015.\" Page 3.",
