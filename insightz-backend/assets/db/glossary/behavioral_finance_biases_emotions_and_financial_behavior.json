  "term": "Behavioral Finance: Biases, Emotions and Financial Behavior",
  "definition": "Behavioral finance is an economic theory that ascribes the irrational behavior of individuals making financial choices to psychological factors or biases.\n\nBehavioral finance, a subfield ofbehavioral economics, proposes that psychological influences and biases affect the financial behaviors of investors and financial practitioners. Moreover, influences and biases can explain all types of market anomalies, including those in the stock market, such as severe rises or falls in stock price.\n\nGiven that behavioral finance is such an integral part of investing, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has staff specifically focused on behavioral finance.\n\nBehavioral finance can be analyzed from a variety of perspectives. Stock market returns are one area of finance wherepsychological behaviorsare often assumed to influence market outcomes and returns but there are also many different angles for observation. The purpose of the classification of behavioral finance is to help understandwhy people make certain financial choicesand how those choices can affect markets.\n\nWithin behavioral finance, it is assumed thatfinancial participants are not perfectly rationaland self-controlled but rather psychologically influential with somewhat normal and self-controlling tendencies. Financial decision-making often relies on the investor's mental and physical health. As an investor's overall health improves or worsens, their mental state often changes. This impacts their decision-making and rationality towards all real-world problems, including those specific to finance.\n\nOne of the key aspects of behavioral finance studies is the influence of biases. Biases can occur for a variety of reasons. Biases can usually be classified into one of five key concepts. Understanding and classifying different types of behavioral finance biases can be very important when narrowing in on the study or analysis of industry or sector outcomes and results.\n\nRead about Investopedia's10 Rules of Investingby picking up a copy of our special issue print edition.\n\nBehavioral finance typically encompasses five main concepts:\n\nBehavioral finance is exploited through credit card rewards, as consumers are more likely to be willing to spend points, rewards, or miles as opposed to paying for transactions with direct cash.\n\nBreaking down biases further, many individual biases and tendencies have been identified for behavioral finance analysis. Some of these include:\n\nConfirmation biasis when investors have a bias toward accepting information that confirms their already-held belief in an investment. If information surfaces, investors accept it readily to confirm that they're correct about their investment decision\u2014even if the information is flawed.\n\nAn experiential bias occurs when investors' memory of recent events makes them biased or leads them to believe that the event is far more likely to occur again. For this reason, it is also known asrecency biasoravailability bias.\n\nFor example, the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 led many investors to exit the stock market. Many had a dismal view of the markets and likely expected more economic hardship in the coming years. The experience of having gone through such a negative event increased their bias or likelihood that the event could reoccur. In reality, the economy recovered, and the market bounced back in the years to follow.\n\nLoss aversionoccurs when investors place greater weight on the concern for losses than the pleasure from market gains. In other words, they're far more likely to try to assign a higher priority to avoiding losses than to making investment gains.\n\nAs a result, some investors might want a higher payout to compensate for losses. If the high payout isn't likely, they might try to avoid losses altogether, even if the investment's risk is acceptable from a rational standpoint.\n\nApplyingloss aversion to investing, the so-called disposition effect occurs when investors sell their winners and hang onto their losers. Investors' thinking is that they want to realize gains quickly. However, when an investment is losing money, they'll hold onto it because they want to get back to even or their initial price. Investors tend to admit they are correct about an investment quickly (when there's a gain).\n\nHowever, investors are reluctant to admit when they made an investment mistake (when there's a loss). The flaw in disposition bias is that the performance of the investment is often tied to the entry price for the investor. In other words, investors gauge the performance of their investment based on their individual entry price, disregarding the fundamentals or attributes of the investment that may have changed.\n\nThefamiliarity biasis when investorstend to invest in what they know, such as domestic companies or locally owned investments. As a result, investors are not diversified across multiple sectors and types of investments, which can reduce risk. Investors tend to go with investments that they have a history or have familiarity with.\n\nFamiliarity bias can occur in so many ways. You may resist investing in a specific company because of what industry it is in, where it operates, what products it sells, who oversees the management of the company, who its clientele is, how it performs its marketing, and how complex its accounting is.\n\nThe\u00a0efficient market hypothesis (EMH)\u00a0says that at any given time in a highlyliquid market, stock prices are efficiently valued to reflect all the available information. However, many studies have documented long-term historical phenomena in securities markets thatcontradict the efficient market hypothesisand can't be plausibly captured in models based on perfect investor rationality.\n\nThe EMH is generally based on the belief that market participants view stock prices rationally based on all current and future intrinsic and external factors. When studying the stock market, behavioral finance takes the view that markets are not fully efficient. This allows for the observation of how psychological and social factors can influence the buying and selling of stocks.\n\nThe understanding and usage of behavioral finance biases can be applied to stock and other trading market movements on a daily basis. Broadly, behavioral finance theories have also been used to provide clearer explanations of substantial market anomalies like bubbles and deep recessions. While not a part of EMH, investors and portfolio managers have a\u00a0vested interest\u00a0in understanding behavioral finance trends. These trends can be used to help analyze market price levels and fluctuations for speculation as well as decision-making purposes.\n\nBehavioral finance helps us understand how financial decisions around things like investments, payments, risk, and personal debt, are greatly influenced by human emotion, biases, andcognitive limitations of the mindin processing and responding to information.\n\nMainstream theory, on the other hand, makes the assumptions in its models that people are rational actors, that they are free from emotion or the effects of culture and social relations, and that people are self-interestedutilitymaximizers. It also assumes, by extension, thatmarkets are efficientand firms arerational profit-maximizing organizations. Behavioral finance counters each of these assumptions.\n\nBy understanding how and when people deviate from rational expectations, behavioral finance provides a blueprint to help us make better decisions in financial matters.\n\nInvestors are found to systematically hold on to losing investments longer than rational expectations would predict, and they also sell winners too early. This is known as the disposition effect, and is an extension of the concept of loss aversion to the domain of investing. Rather than locking in a paper loss, investors holding losing positions may even double down and take on greater risk in hopes of breaking even.\n\nBehavioral finance is an area of economics that fuses with psychology. It ascribes the often irrational behavior of individuals when faced with financial choices to a variety of biases and heuristics. Often, individuals are unaware of the underlying biases at work that can underlie bad decision-making. A study of this area of finance is essential to anyone who wants to master the art of trading and investing.",
