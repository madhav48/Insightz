  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nVertical equity is a method of collectingincome taxin which the taxes paid increase with the amount of earnedincome. The driving principle behind vertical equity is that those who have the ability to pay more taxes should contribute more than those who are not.\n\nThis can be contrasted withhorizontal equity, whereby\u00a0individuals with similar income andassetsshould pay the same amount intaxes.\n\nThe equity of a tax system speaks to whether the tax burden is distributed fairly among the population. Theability to payprinciple states that the amount of tax an individual pays should be dependent on the level of burden the tax will create relative to thewealthof the individual. Theability to pay principlegives rise to two notions of fairness and equity: vertical and horizontal equity.\n\nVertical equity drives the principle that people with higher incomes should pay more tax, through proportional or progressive tax rates. Inproportional taxation, the amount of taxes paid increases directly with income. Everyone pays the same proportion of their income in tax since the effective average tax rate does not change with income.\n\nFor an example of vertical equity, consider ataxpayerwho earns $100,000 per annum and another who earns $50,000 per annum. If the tax rate is flat and proportional at 15%, the higher income earner will pay $15,000 tax for the giventax year, while the taxpayer with the lower income will have atax liabilityof $7,500. With the same rate applied across all income amounts, the individuals with more resources or higher income levels will always pay more tax in dollars than lower earners.\n\nProgressive taxation includestax brackets, in which people pay taxes based on the tax bracket that their income places them. Each tax bracket will have a different tax rate, with higher income brackets paying the highest percentages.\n\nUnder this taxation system, effective average tax rates increase with income, so that the rich pay a higher share of their income in taxes than people whose self-reported incomes were in the lowest income bracket. For example, in the United States, a single taxpayer who earns $100,000 has a topmarginal tax rateof 22%, as of 2024.Their tax liability would be $5,426 plus 22% of any excess over $100,000.The top marginal tax rate for a single taxpayer whose annual income is $50,000 is also 22%.In this case, this taxpayer would pay $5,426 plus 22% of any excess over $50,000.For 2025, the marginal tax rate remains 22%, but a single taxpayer who earns $100,000 or $50,000 would pay $5,578.50 plus 22% of any excess over $100,000 or $50,000, respectively.\n\nThe other yardstick that is used to measure equity in a taxation system is horizontal equity, which states that people with similar abilities to pay should contribute the same amount in taxes to theeconomy. The basis behind this notion is that people in the same income group are equal in their contribution capacity to society and, thus, should be treated the same by imposing the same level of income tax.\n\nFor example, if two taxpayers earn $50,000, they should both be taxed the same rate since they both have the same wealth or fall within the same income bracket. However, horizontal equity is hard to achieve in a tax system withloopholes,deductions, and incentives, because the provision of any tax break means that similar individuals effectively do not pay the same rate.\n\nYes. Vertical equity is a method of income taxation whereby more taxes are paid as income increases.\n\nVertical equity is based on the principle of the ability to pay through progressive tax rates or proportional taxation.\n\nYes. Horizontal equity, whereby\u00a0individuals with similar income and assets should pay the same amount in taxes, can be undermined by loopholes and deductions.\n\nVertical equity is a method of collecting income tax in which the taxes paid increase with the amount of earned income.
