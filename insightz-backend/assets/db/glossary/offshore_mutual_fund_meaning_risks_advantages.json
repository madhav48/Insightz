  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nAn offshore mutual fund is an investment vehicle-based in anoffshorelocation outside the jurisdiction of the United States, often used as a tax haven.\n\nOffshore mutual funds are domiciled internationally. They may provide investment exposure to international markets. They are known to offer some cost benefits such as lower taxes, as well.\n\nInternationally domiciled funds are obligated to follow the laws and regulations of the country where they are incorporated. Funds may choose their domicile to target a specific investor. Many offshore funds are incorporated in the Bahamas or Cayman Islands, which offer tax efficiencies. Taxation, regulation, and investor demand are three main factors influencing the country a fund chooses to incorporate in. The United States addresses specific offshore definitions and legislative obligations in Section 871 of theInternal Revenue Code.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOffshore funds can be structured much like an open-end investment fund. They can also be formed as an offshore company, partnership, orunit trust. Most offshore funds are\u00a0required to have operational functionalities in their domiciled country. This has led to substantial fund administration, management, custodian, and prime brokerage services in popular offshore locations.\n\nOffshore funds can\u00a0havehigher risks. With domicile in a foreign country, investors may not clearly understand a fund\u2019s terms and conditions, which could lead to unprotected loss of capital. Offshore funds may\u00a0follow different rules and regulations than standard investments, which could\u00a0present some higher risks of capital loss.\n\nGenerally, offshore funds seek to provide an advantage through their international incorporation. The lower level of regulation makes it easier to establish and administer the funds. Funds domiciled in most offshore countries allow for tax-free income, which enables the fund to reinvest gains. They also include tax-free distributions for investors.Operating costsare significantly reduced, andmanagement feescan be lower.\n\nInvestors should always add extra due diligence wheninvestingmoney in offshore accounts with sponsors that are not well known or are located outside of established offshore financial centers. While many funds offer competitive advantages, non-mainstream offerings can be prone to fraudulent activity because of relaxed regulations in some offshore locations.\n\nMany brokerage platforms will offer their investors a selection of offshore funds, which can help to reduce some of the investment risks.
