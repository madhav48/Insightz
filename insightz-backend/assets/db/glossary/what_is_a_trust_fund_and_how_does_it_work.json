  "term": "What Is a Trust Fund and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "A trust fund is anestate planningtool that holds property or assets for a person or an organization. Trust funds are sometimes simply referred to as \"trusts.\" They can hold a variety of assets such as money, real property, stocks, bonds, a business, or a combination of many types of properties orassets.\n\nEstablishing a trust fund involves multiple parties: the grantor, the beneficiary or beneficiaries, and the trustee. Trust funds can have more than one beneficiary. They're managed by the trustee who has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the grantor and beneficiaries.\n\nTrust funds can take many forms and they can be established with different stipulations. They can be revocable or irrevocable. Some offer tax benefits and financial protections as well as support for those involved.\n\nEstate planning is a process that involves determining how an individual's assets and other financial affairs will be managed and how any property they own will be distributed after they die. Property can include any bank accounts, investments, personal property, real estate, and/orlife insurance. Wills are the most common estate planning tool but trust funds are also popular legal entities.Laws governing trust fundscan vary depending on the country of residency and creation.\n\nThe following parties are involved in establishing a trust:\n\nThe grantor generally creates an inheritance arrangement that's carried out after they're no longer mentally competent or alive. As the appointedfiduciary, the trustee is responsible for carrying out the interests and wishes of the grantor. This can include allocating living expenses or even educational expenses such as private school or college expenses and/or paying alump sumor transferring property to the beneficiary or beneficiaries after death.\n\nTrust funds provide certain benefits and protections for those who create them and their beneficiaries.\n\nAll trust funds are either revocable or irrevocable. Both are referred to as\"living\" trustswhen the grantor creates them during their lifetime. A \"testamentary\" trust is one that's created after the grantor's death, usually under terms left in a last will. It's irrevocable because the grantor is no longer living to make changes to it.\n\nThe grantor can change the terms of arevocable trustat any time or even dissolve and undo the trust completely if they choose. Assets funded or placed into a revocable trust can be transferred to any number of designated beneficiaries after the grantor's death or even during their lifetime.\n\nThe primary benefit of a revocable trust is that the assets avoid probate after the grantor's death. This leads to the quick distribution of assets to the named beneficiaries. The terms of a revocable trust aren't made public like those of a last will so an estate can be distributed with a high level of privacy.\n\nGrantors can act as their own trustees when they form a revocable trust or they can appoint someone else to the role. They can name a successor trustee to take over management of the revocable trust after their death when the assets are typically distributed to beneficiaries and the revocable trust is dissolved.\n\nAnirrevocable trustfund is very difficult if not impossible to change or dissolve. Undoing it or its terms typically requires the unanimous consent of all beneficiaries.\n\nThis makes them virtually immune to estate taxes and creditor claims. The grantor of a revocable trust can take back assets they've placed into the trust at any time so they're still considered to personally own them. This isn't the case with an irrevocable trust. The grantor permanently gives up control and ownership of the assets and money placed into the trust although they set the terms as to the beneficiaries who will receive them and when.\n\nSeveral types of trust funds are included under the umbrellas of revocable and irrevocable trusts. They often have different rules and stipulations depending on the assets involved and the beneficiaries. A tax or a trust attorney may be your best resource for understanding the intricacies of each of these vehicles. This isn't an exhaustive list.\n\nWealth and family arrangements can grow quite complicated when a great deal of money is at stake for multiple generations of a family or another entity. A trust fund can include a surprisingly complex array of options and specifications as a result.\n\nTrust funds aren't just for the ultra-rich, contrary to what some people believe. Anyone can use them regardless of their financial situation. Discuss your needs with a financial or legal professional to find out what kind of fund is well-suited for you.\n\nA trust fund baby is someone whose parents have set up a trust fund for them. The term is a popular cultural reference that's often used negatively. There's an implication that these beneficiaries are born with silver spoons in their mouths, are overly privileged, and don't have to work to earn a living.\n\nTrust funds can indeed provide beneficiaries with security but many so-called trust fund babies don't live luxuriously or in high society.\n\nA trust fund is a legal entity that holds property and assets and can provide financial, tax, and legal protections. A grantor sets it up and funds it with money or assets. One or more beneficiaries receive the assets under specified terms. The trustee manages the trust and distributes its assets at a prescribed time.\n\nThe trustee is in charge of managing the assets in an irrevocable trust while the grantor is still alive. The trustee can pass the assets on to the beneficiary or beneficiaries per the grantor's instructions after the grantor's death under the trust terms that the grantor has set.\n\nGrantors often act as trustees of their revocable trusts. They name successor trustees to take over management and dissolution of the trust when they die.\n\nYou'll first have to figure out which type of trust is best suited for you. Then decide how you'll fund it. Figure out who you want to appoint as your trustee or successor trustee. The final step is to fund the trust.\n\nBe sure a trust fund is the best choice for you, your beneficiary, and your financial situation. Seek legal help to set up the proper documents so you're sure the trust will serve the purpose you intend and its terms will be honored by the court.\n\nA trust fund is a living or testamentary trust that\u2019s set up to hold and manage assets on behalf of its beneficiaries. It can be either revocable or irrevocable depending on the purposes you want it to serve and how much control you're willing to relinquish. Both types of trusts avoid probate but only irrevocable trusts can dodge estate taxes and avoid creditor claims.\n\nTrust funds can serve a multitude of purposes. Your best bet is to consult with a legal professional if you think one might be right for you. A professional can guide you to what type of trust will most fully meet your needs. They can ensure that the formation documents are created properly so they\u2019ll achieve your goals and hold up in court should anyone contest the trust\u2019s terms.\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Trust.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\" Pages 11, 14.\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"Irrevocable Trust.\"\n\nJustia. \"Testamentary Trusts Under the Law.\"\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Extension. \"Trusts: Definitions, Types and Taxation.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 5227 Split-Interest Trust Information Return.\" Page 2.\n\nJournal of Accountancy. \"The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax: A Quick Guide.\"",
