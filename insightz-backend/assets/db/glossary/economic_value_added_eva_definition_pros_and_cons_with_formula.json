  "definition": "Economic value added (EVA) is a measure of a company'sfinancial performancebased on the residual wealth calculated by deducting its cost of capital from its operating profit, adjusted for taxes on a cash basis. EVA can also be referred to aseconomic profit, as it attempts to capture the true economic profit of a company. This measure was devised by management consulting firm Stern Value Management, originally incorporated as Stern Stewart & Co.\n\nEVA is the incremental difference in therate of return (RoR)over a company's cost of capital. Essentially, it is used to measure the value a companygenerates from funds investedin it. If a company's EVA is negative, it means the company is not generating value from the funds invested into the business. Conversely, apositive EVAshows a company is producing value from the funds invested in it.\n\nThe formula for calculating EVA is:\n\nEVA = NOPAT - (Invested Capital * WACC)\n\nThe equation for EVA\u00a0shows that there are three key components to a company's EVA\u2014NOPAT, the amount of capital invested, and the WACC. NOPAT can be calculated manually but is normally listed in apublic company'sfinancials.\n\nCapital invested is the amount of money used to fund a company or a specific project. WACC is the average rate of return a company expects to pay its investors; the weights are derived as a fraction of each financial source in a company'scapital structure. WACC can also be calculated but is normally provided.\n\nThe equation used for\u00a0invested capital in EVA is usually total assets minus current liabilities\u2014two figures easily found on a firm's balance sheet. In this case, the modified formula for EVA is NOPAT\u00a0- (total assets - current liabilities) * WACC.\n\nAs noted by Stern Value Management, in 1983 the management team developed EVA, \"a new model for maximizing the value created that can also be used to provide incentives at all levels of the firm.\"The goal of EVA is to quantify the cost of investing capital into a certain project\u00a0or firm and then assess whether it generates\u00a0enough cash to be considered a good investment. A positive EVA shows a project is generating returns in excess of the required minimum return.\n\nEVA assesses the performance of a company\u00a0and its management through\u00a0the idea that a business is only profitable when it creates wealth and returns forshareholders, thus requiring\u00a0performance above a company's cost of capital.\n\nEVA as a performance indicator is very useful. The calculation shows how and where a company created wealth, through the inclusion ofbalance sheetitems. This forces managers to be aware of assets and expenses when making managerial decisions.\n\nHowever, the EVA calculation relies heavily on the amount ofinvested capitaland is best used for asset-rich companies that are stable or mature. Companies withintangible assets, such as technology businesses, may not be good candidates for an EVA evaluation.\n\nStern Value Management. \"Our History.\"",
