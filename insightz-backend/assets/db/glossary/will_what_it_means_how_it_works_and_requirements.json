  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA will, also called a\u00a0last will and testament, is a legally enforceable declaration of how a person wants their property andassetsdistributed after death.\n\nA will can serve other purposes, as well. For example, through their will, a person can recommend a guardian to care for surviving minor children or state their preferences for their remains and funeral.\n\nA will is an important component ofestate planning. It ensures that a person's wishes are documented and carried out, makes it easier for heirs to obtain the assets left to them, and can prevent family squabbles over the property that someone leaves behind.\n\nIf an individualdies without a will, the distribution of that person's property is left up to the state government, and may even end up becoming state property.\n\nThe format of a will varies, but most follow afairly uniform layout.\n\nThe document usually begins with a statement that the writer is of legal age and is making the will freely and withoutduress.\n\nIt attests to the writer's mental soundness at the time the will was made. This section also establishes the writer's identity and includes an explicit statement that this document rescinds any previous will.\n\nIn the will, the writer names anexecutoror personal representative to oversee theliquidationand distribution of thedecedent'sassets, according to the terms of the will. The executor must also pay any outstanding debts and taxes on the estate.\n\nAn executor may be an attorney or financial expert, or anyone that the writer of the will trusts to act responsibly.\n\nThe executor may be entitled to receive a reasonable fee for services rendered. Fee guidelines are mandated by the state.\n\nAfter naming an executor and guardian for any minor children, the will should discussinsurancepolicies that have anamed beneficiary.\n\nWills do not supplant agreements related to life insurance proceeds, retirement assets, or transfer-on-death investment accounts.\n\nThis section may also itemize joint bank accounts and property that is co-owned with other individuals.\n\nMake sure that the named beneficiaries for all of your financial and insurance accounts match the names of beneficiaries in your will. If they are different, the beneficiary designation in your accounts will override the intentions expressed in your will. (Of course, you may wish to leave certain financial assets to beneficiaries other than those named in your will.)\n\nThebequestsection of the will specifies beneficiaries for all of the deceased person's property or assets, except for insurance policies, financial accounts, andjoint accountsmentioned in the preceding section.\n\nIt's crucial that all beneficiaries are named. Clear and reasonable instructions will prevent possible legal challenges that could delayprobateand create significant legal expenses.\n\nA will may also include instructions about the writer's funeral and burial wishes. If the decedent made arrangements for a burial plot or funeral expenses, those should be stated in this section.\n\nMost states require that a will be witnessed by two individuals and signed and dated by the writer at the end of the document.Holographic willsmay be used in some states.\n\nAfter death, the will is submitted to theprobate courtof the county or city in which the individual resided.\n\nThe probate process can be fairly quick or protracted, depending on the estate laws of the state in which the decedent lived, the complexity of theestate, and whether there are legal challenges to the will.\n\nA clear and complete will can make the process as efficient and smooth as possible.\n\nYou can write a will without a lawyer, using astandard low cost will formavailable from websites such as LegalZoom and Quicken WillMaker & Trust or even from a stationery shop. You may find this adequate if you have an uncomplicated financial situation and straightforward family circumstances, such as a single child.\n\nIf you have substantial assets such as a home, bank and investment accounts, life insurance, and property of value, it's worth it to prepare your will with the advice of an attorney. The attorney will ask the right questions about your assets and your intentions, and will know the state process that comes into play when a will is recorded.\n\nIn 2024, just 32% of Americans had a will. Many ofthose without a will(40%) cited a lack of assets as the reason why they failed to create one.\n\nWhether you do it on your own or with the help of an attorney, you need a fair amount of documentation to complete your will. Basically, you need to prove your own identity and list all of your assets.\n\nEstablishing your own identity means collecting your birth certificate and documents like your marriage license.\n\nListing your assets includes identifying all of your bank and investment account numbers, mortgage documents, and property deeds, and the names and addresses of any lawyers, accountants, and financial advisers that you consult.\n\nWriting your willcould be the last good deed that you do for your friends and loved ones. Dying without a will (known as dying intestate) leaves behind a mess for them to straighten out. Worse, it could mean that your good intentions won't be carried out as you wish them to be.\n\nCaring. \"2024 Wills and Estate Planning Study.\"",
