  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA transfer agent is atrust company, bank, or similar institution assigned by a corporation for the purposes of maintaining an investor's financial records and tracking each investor's account balance. The transfer agent records transactions, cancels and issues certificates, processes investor mailings, and handles a host of other investor problems, including reissuing lost or stolen certificates.\n\nTransfer agents work closely withregistrarsto ensure investors receive their due interest and dividend payments in a timely manner. Transfer agents likewise oversee the mailing of monthly investment statements tomutual fundshareholders.\n\nTraditionally, when investors purchased asecurity, they received a physical paper certificate. Today, transfer agents issue certificates inbook-entry form\u2014an electronic method of recording securities ownership that saves vast amounts of time and money. These book-entry securities vary depending on the investment.\n\nFor example, bonds are often issued in $1,000 multiples, while stock andmutual fundholdings are issued asshares. Meanwhile,unit investment trusts(UIT) are sold in block units. Transfer agents process all types of securities in book-entry form, in whatever necessary shape they must take.\n\nIt's possible to identify which transfer agent a company uses by checking out the investor relations section of its website.\n\nCommon andpreferred stockshareholders have the right to vote on major corporate decisions, such asmergeractivities and the sale of companies. These votes are facilitated through transfer agents, who sendproxyinformation to shareholders.\n\nTransfer agents likewise furnish shareholders withannual reports, including companies' audited financial statements. And at year-end, transfer agents and registrars jointly send federal tax information to investors, includingdividendinformation and interest paid, along with data on security trades executed during the year.\n\nTransfer agents pay distributions to investors, based on the registrar's records. For example, transfer agents send interest payments tobondholders, as well as the face value of their bonds, once they reach maturity. Similarly, transfer agents sendcash dividendpayments to stock investors when the companies they invest in generate sufficient earnings.\n\nTransfer agents also send stock shares to investors after astock split. If, for example, the company has a 3-for-1 stock split, eachshareholderreceives two additional shares for every share they already own.\n\nIf investors hold securities in their own names and wish to transfer or sell those securities, they may need to get their signatures guaranteed before the transfer agent will accept the transactions.\n\nMutual fund transfer agents differ from stock transfer agents in one key function: the former never issuephysical certificates, whereas the latter must do so on shareholder request. However, mutual fund transfer agents perform many other important tasks, like maintaining records of shareholders' accounts, overseeing dividend payments, and responding to shareholder requests for account statements, income tax forms, and transaction confirmations.\n\nAll shareholders are entitled to accurate information about their investments. While some corporations choose to act as their own transfer agents, other companies decide to use third-parties like trust companies, banks, or similar financial institutions. These companies receive fees for their services.\n\nThese third-party companies specialize in providing transfer agent services and many corporations find the expense of hiring a third-party company well worth it. Transfer agents handle a detailed and challenging job, especially for large corporations with many shareholders. For example, it's not uncommon for a publicly traded company toissue millions of shares of stock. Someone has to keep all of the information relevant to those millions of shares in order.\n\nIt's part of the company'sfiduciary responsibilityto its shareholders to ensure thatall investor records, account balances, and transactions are safeguarded and accurately tracked. Transfer agents fulfill this vital role in maintaining records and providing investors with timely and reliable information.\n\nA transfer agent acts as a liaison between a company's registrar and an investor. A broker, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary between an investor and an exchange, buying and selling securities for its clients.\n\nPublicly traded companies listed on a stock exchange need transfer agents to maintain records of shareholder accounts, calculate and distribute dividends, and keep investors up to date with what\u2019s going on. Mutual funds and issuers of debt securities also rely on transfer agents for similar reasons.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, the average total pay of a transfer agent in the U.S. is $52,854 per year. That\u2019s based on an average salary of $41,323 and additional payments, such as bonuses and commissions, of $11,531. The range is quite wide, though. The highest-paid transfer agent could make up to about $89,000.\n\nCompanies use transfer agents to keep track of the individuals and entities that own their stocks and bonds. Most of the time they get these agents from third parties, such as trust companies, banks, or similar financial institutions.\n\nThe main duties of a transfer agent are to keep a record of who owns a company\u2019s stocks and bonds, issue and cancel certificates to reflectchanges in ownership, and payout distributions, and send useful information to stakeholders, such as annual reports and how to vote at meetings. The transfer agent essentially acts as a liaison between a company and its investors.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cTransfer Agents.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Holding Your Securities - Get the Facts.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"\"Medallion Signature Guarantees: Preventing the Unauthorized Transfer of Securities.\"\n\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation. \"Section 11- Role Of The Transfer Agent.\"\n\nGlassdoor. \u201cHow much does a Transfer Agent make?\u201d",
