  "term": "Business to Government (B2G): Selling to The Government",
  "definition": "Business to government (B2G) is the sale andmarketing of goodsand services to federal, state, or local agencies. In modern lingo, there are three basic business models:business to consumer(B2C), business to business (B2B), and business to government (B2G).\n\nB2G is not an insignificant chunk of business. By the end of May 2024, the federal government had spent over $3.8 trillion in the fiscal year to date.Notably, a portion of its business is supposed to be spent on small business suppliers.\n\nB2B business can be as modest as a small business providing IT support services to a town government. It can be as big as Boeing, which builds helicopters, missile defense systems, fighter jets, and surveillance aircraft, among many other products, for the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD).\n\nAt the federal level, the General Services Administration (GSA) is the government's official buying arm, developing and implementing regulations on a vast array of products and services purchased for the U.S. government.\n\nGovernments generally solicit services from theprivate sectorthroughrequests for proposal(RFPs).\n\nThe GSA website, GSAAdvantage.gov, is a shopping portal for government agencies and gives an idea of the sheer breadth of products purchased by the federal government.\n\nNot surprisingly, given the enormous numbers and range of federal, state, and local purchasing requirements, an entire sector of the internet is devoted to matching businesses to government agencies.\n\nBusinesses that are used to interacting with other businesses or directly with consumers often encounter unexpected hurdles when working with government agencies.\n\nGovernments tend to take more time than private companies to approve and to begin work on a given project. Layers of regulation can drag on the overall efficiency of the contracting process.\n\nWhile businesses may find that government contracts involve additional paperwork, time, and vetting, there are advantages to providing goods and services to the public sector.\n\nGovernment contracts are often large and more stable than analogous private-sector work.\u00a0A company with a history of successful government contracting usually finds it easier to get the next contract.\n\nFederal requirements often specify that certain amounts of appropriated funds must be spent on contracts with small businesses. This potentially can give smaller businesses an advantage in B2G activity, or at least offset some of the advantages that large, well-established government contractors may already enjoy.\n\nThe Small Business Administration (SBA) offers an online guide to help small businesses win federal contracts.\n\nIn order to qualify as a small business contractor, a business must be properly registered as such, demonstrating that it is independently owned and operated and makes a significant contribution to the U.S. economy, among other requirements.\n\nIn addition to small businesses, federal laws and regulations often mandate certain amounts of spending be directed toward groups such as veterans, women, and racial or ethnic minorities. Small businessesowned by members of these groupsmay enjoy special advantages in obtaining B2G contracts.\n\nBecause of the scale of government spending at local, state, and federal levels, there are a broad range of B2G examples.\n\nSome of the most evident involve infrastructure spending at a national scale\u2014think about construction firms contracted to build interstate freeways or to repair railroads. B2G can also look like a food service provider contracted to supply produce to local public schools.\n\nB2G contracts benefit both parties involved in a contract. The government agency obtains a good or service from a firm with experience in a given sector, and the contracted firm receives revenue for its products.\n\nB2A is virtually synonymous with B2G. While B2G stands for \"business to government,\" B2A stands for \"business to administration.\" This refers to commerce conducted between businesses and administrative branches of government. The two concepts are often used interchangeably.\n\nBusiness to government (B2G) refers to the provisions of goods and services to the government sector. It's a distinct form of business model, much like business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C) models. Both established firms and small businesses alike can seek to obtain B2G contracts by responding to requests for proposals. Because of the scale of government spending, B2G contracts are often highly coveted.\n\nDepartment of Treasury. \"How Much Has the U.S. Government Spent This Year?\"\n\nBoeing. \"Defense.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nU.S. General Services Administration. \"Buying and Selling.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nGSA Advantage! \"Home.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Contracting Guide.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Basic Requirements.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Types of Contracts.\" Accessed Aug. 12, 2021.",
