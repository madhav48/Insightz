  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nIntraday means \"within the day.\" In the financial world, the term is shorthand used to describe securities that trade on the markets during regular business hours. These securities include stocks andexchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nIntraday also signifies the highs and lows that the asset price crossed throughout the day. Intraday price movements are particularly significant\u00a0to short-term orday traderslooking to make multiple trades over the course of a single trading session. These busy traders will settle all their positions when the market closes.\n\nIntraday is often used to refer to the new highs and lows of any particular security. For example, \"a new intraday high\" means the security reached a new high relative to all other prices during a trading session. In some cases, an intraday high can be equal to theclosing price.\n\nTraders pay close attention to intraday price movements by using real-time charts in an attempt to benefit from short-term price fluctuations. Short-term traders typically use one-, five-, 15-, 30- and 60-minute intraday charts when trading within the market day. Typically, intradayscalpinguses one- and five-minute charts for high-speed trading. Other intraday trading strategies may use 30- and 60-minute charts for trades that have hold times of several hours. The intraday trader may hold their positions for a longer period but still operate under high risks.\n\nScalping is a strategy of transacting many trades per day with the intent of profiting from small movements in a stock's price.\n\nVolume weighted average price (VWAP)orders are often used on an intraday basis to increase trade execution efficiency by giving an order exposure to a variety of prices throughout the trading day. VWAP gives an averaged price that particular securities trade at throughout the trading day.\n\nTraders use numerous intraday strategies. These strategies include:\n\nAll these strategies depend on timing your trades based on price fluctuations that occur within a single day, sometimes within minutes of each other.\n\nThe most significant benefit of intraday trading is that positions are not affected by negative overnight news that materially impacts the price of securities. Such news includes vital economic and earnings reports, as well as broker upgrades and downgrades that occur either before the market opens or after the market closes.\n\nTrading on an intraday basis offers several other key advantages. One advantage is the ability to use tight stop-loss orders, which is the act of raising a stop price to minimize losses from a long position. Another includes the increased access to margin and hence, greater leverage. Intraday trading also provides traders with more learning opportunities because so many trades are executed so quickly.\n\nHowever, there are also drawbacks to intraday trading strategies. Intraday trading may provide insufficient time for a position to see increases in profit or, in some cases, any profit at all. If a trader experiences losses instead of profits, these can mount quickly. Some assets are off-limits for intraday trading, including mutual funds. Finally, intraday trading strategies also come with increased commission costs due to trading more frequently. These costs can eat away at the profit margins a trader can expect.\n\nPositions are unaffected by risk from overnight news or off-hours broker moves.\n\nTight stop-loss orders can protect positions.\n\nRegular traders have access to increased leverage.\n\nNumerous trades increase hands-on learning experience.\n\nFrequent trades mean multiple commission costs.\n\nSome assets are off-limits, like mutual funds.\n\nThere may not be sufficient time for a position to realize a profit before it has to be closed out.\n\nLosses can mount quickly, especially if margin is used to finance purchases.\n\nMutual funds are off-limits for intraday trading. The design of these funds is for the long-term investor, and they can only be bought and sold through a broker or the fund's investment company. Also, a mutual fund's price posts only once, at the close of the trading day. This price is known as thenet asset value (NAV)and reflects all of the intraday movement of the fund's assets, less its liabilities, calculated on a per-share basis.\n\nSo, mutual funds do not offer intraday pricing, as their assets fluctuate in market value and their managers make buy and sell decisions all day. However, ETFs\u2014their passively managed cousins\u2014are priced according to their intraday market value within a trading session.\n\nThe price movements of any stock are posted throughout the trading day and summarized at the end of the trading day. For example, April 4, 2022, shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) opened at $174.57 and closed at $178.44. During the day, as indicated in the \"day's range\" listed to the right of the closing price, shares dropped as low as $174.44\u2014the intraday low\u2014and hit a peak of $178.49\u2014theintraday high.\n\nDay traders and technical analysts who follow Apple would study the shares' moves, to see if they could discern any pattern or uncover any significant gap\u2014that is, a sudden jump in the price with no trading in-between.\n\nDay traders make money by trading assets based on small price fluctuations throughout the day. They often use high amounts of leverage to make these trades. It involves high levels of risk and can be highly lucrative or lead to large losses, depending on the traders' positions and the amount of leverage used.\n\nThe largest risk of intraday trading is the risk of losing large amounts of money. Day trading comes with high levels of risk as prices fluctuate. It can be difficult to earn any level of long-term profit, especially for new or inexperienced traders.\n\nThe price of a mutual fund only posts at the end of the day, so there are no intraday price fluctuations for a day trader to make use of. Mutual funds are designed for long-term investors and can only be bought or sold through a broker or the fund's investment company.\n\nIntraday refers to securities that trade during regular business hours, as well as to the movement in their prices over the course of a day. Intraday traders use these price fluctuations to execute trades, trying to make a profit on small changes in price.\n\nIntraday trading strategies include scalping, range trading, and news-based trading. As with any trading strategy, these come with benefits and drawbacks. Intraday traders can use tight stop-loss orders to protect their positions, and they often have increased access to leverage. Their positions aren't impacted by overnight news that can affect price changes. However, their losses can easily mount, especially if they use margin to finance their positions, and high commission costs from frequent trading can eat into any potential profits.\n\nYahoo Finance. \"Apple Inc.
