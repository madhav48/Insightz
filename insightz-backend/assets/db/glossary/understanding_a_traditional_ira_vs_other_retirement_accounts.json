He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nA traditionalindividual retirement account (IRA)allows individuals to deposit pre-tax income into investments that can grow tax-deferred. The IRS assesses no capital gains or dividend income taxes until the beneficiary makes a withdrawal. Individual taxpayers can contribute from qualified earned compensation.\n\nYou can contribute to a traditional IRA no matter how high your income is. However, limitations on deductions may apply, depending on your income, tax-filing status, and other factors. Retirement savers may open a traditional IRA through their broker (includingonline brokersor robo-advisors) or financial advisor.\n\nTraditional IRAs let individuals contribute pre-tax dollars to a retirement investment account, which can growtax-deferreduntil retirement withdrawals occur (at age 59\u00bd or later) when they are taxable income. If you withdraw money before age 59\u00bd, it is also subject to a10% early withdrawal penaltyunless you qualify for an exemption.Custodians, including commercial banks and retail brokers, hold traditional IRAs and place the invested funds into different investments according to the account holder\u2019s instruction and the offerings available.\n\nContributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible in most cases. For instance, if someone contributes $7,000 to their IRA in a given year, they can claim that amount as adeductionon their income tax return, and theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)will not apply income tax to those earnings. However, when that individual withdraws money from the account\u2014presumably during retirement\u2014earnings are taxed at the account owner\u2019s ordinary income tax rate for that year.\n\nThe IRS restricts contributions to a traditional IRA each year, depending on the account holder's age. The contribution limit for the 2024 and 2025 tax years is $7,000 for savers under 50 years of age. People aged 50 or above are allowed to contribute up to an extra $1,000\u2014known as acatch-up contribution\u2014for a total maximum of $8,000.\n\nUnder the SECURE Act of 2019, age restrictions on contributions to a traditional IRA were lifted. You do need allowable taxable earned income, such as wages, salaries, tips, and self-employment earnings. And you can contribute as much as your allowable taxable earned income, up to the overall annual contribution limit, which is $7,000 in 2024 and 2025, plus another $1,000 if you are aged 50 or older.\n\nWhen you have both a traditional IRA and\u00a0an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the IRS may limit the amount of your traditional IRA contributions that you can deduct from your taxes.\n\nIf a taxpayer participates in an employer-sponsored program such as a 401(k) or pension program and files as a single person, they would only be eligible to take the full deduction on a traditional IRA contribution if theirmodified adjusted gross income (MAGI)is $77,000 for 2024 ($79,000 for 2025). Married taxpayers filing a joint return can take the full deduction if their income is less than $123,000 for the 2024 tax year and less than $126,000 for 2025.\n\nFor 2024, the IRS allows no deductions with MAGIs of $87,000 for singles ($89,000 for 2025) and $143,000 ($146,000 for 2025) for married couples. The deduction is gradually reduced\u2014commonly referred to as being \u201cphased out\u201d\u2014depending on where the filer's income falls between the bottom and top of the phase-out range.\n\nIRA contributions must also be made by the tax filing deadline. For most taxpayers, this is on or around April 15 of the year after the calendar year in which the filer earned the allowable taxable income that their contribution came from.\n\nIncome tax is ultimately paid on IRA money at the time of withdrawal, subject to the account owner's tax bracket during retirement. Therefore, traditional IRAs are more often recommended for investors who expect to be in lowertax bracketsat retirement than they were when they earned the income.\n\nWhen you receive distributions from a traditional IRA, the IRS treats the money as ordinary income and subjects it to income tax. Account holders can take distributions as early as age 59\u00bd without penalty.\n\nThe age forrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)from traditional IRAs depends on which year you were born. With a traditional IRA, your RMDs must start at these ages:\n\nThe deadline for taking your RMD is December 31 each year. The deadline for taking your first RMD is April 1 of the year after you turn 73. That\u2019s the only RMD that you can delay in that way.\n\nFunds that are withdrawn before age 59\u00bdincur a 10% penalty(of the amount withdrawn) and taxes at standard incometax rates. There areexceptions to these penaltiesfor certain situations.\n\nCheck with a tax attorney or the IRS to be sure that the particulars of your situation qualify for a waiver of the 10% penalty.\n\nOther variations of the IRA include the Roth IRA, SIMPLE IRA, and SEP IRA. The latter two are offered by businesses\u2014SIMPLE IRAs, in particular, are popular among small businesses\u2014while individuals can set up a Roth IRA if they meet the income limitations. These individual accounts can be created through a broker. You can check out some of the best options with Investopedia's list of the best brokers for IRAs.\n\nUnlike a traditional IRA,Roth IRAcontributions are not tax-deductible, and qualifieddistributionsare tax-free. This means you contribute to a Roth IRA using after-tax dollars\u2014money left over after you\u2019ve paid your income tax\u2014but as the account grows, you do not face any taxes on investment gains. Because you paid taxes on your contributions, you can actually withdraw them, penalty-free at any time.\n\nYou can also withdraw earnings once you reach age 59\u00bd without being subject to tax or the 10% early withdrawal penalty if you\u2019ve had the Roth IRA for at least five years. If you\u2019re 59\u00bd or older but you\u2019ve had the Roth IRA for less than five years, withdrawn earnings will be subject to tax but not penalties.\n\nIf you are under the age of 59\u00bd and your Roth IRA is at least five years old, withdrawn earnings will not be hit by tax if you use the withdrawal (up to $10,000) to buy your first home. If you are under the age of 59\u00bd, withdrawals from a Roth IRA you\u2019ve had less than five years are vulnerable to tax and penalty. Still, you may be able to legally dodge the penalty\u2014but not the tax\u2014if one or more exemptions allowed by the IRS apply. Those exemptions include using the withdrawal (up to $10,000) for a first home purchase, qualified education expenses, or certain unreimbursed medical expenses.\n\nRoth IRAs do not have RMDs. If you don't need the money, you don't have to take it out of your account and worry about penalties for failing to do so. You can also pass the money to your heirs if you don't end up needing to use it.\n\nAnnual Roth IRA contribution limits are the same as those for traditional IRAs: $7,000 unless you are 50 or older and can qualify for the catch-up contribution, which raises the limit to $8,000 in 2024 and 2025. The catch is that not everyone qualifies to contribute to a Roth IRA. There are income limitations, with contributions gradually phased out as your MAGI increases.\n\nIf you earn above those amounts, you can't contribute to a Roth at all.\n\nSIMPLE IRAsandSEP IRAsare benefit plans instituted by an employer. Individuals cannot open them, but self-employed or sole proprietors may. Generally, these IRAs function similarly to traditional IRAs, but they have higher contribution limits and may allow for company matches.\n\nA simplified employee pension (SEP or SEP IRA) is a retirement plan that an employer or self-employed individual can establish. The employer is allowed a tax deduction for contributions made to the SEP plan. Fundamentally, a SEP IRA can be considered a traditional IRA with the ability to receive employer contributions. In fact, it only takes contributions from employers, not employees. A company owner must contribute the same percentage of pay to each worker\u2019s account as they contribute to their own account. Another major benefit it offers employees is that employer contributions arevestedimmediately.\n\nA SIMPLE IRA is a retirement savings plan that can be used by most small businesses with 100 or fewer employees.SIMPLEstands for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers. Employers can choose to make a 2% retirement account contribution to all employees whether or not the employee contributes. Alternatively, employers can make a matching contribution of up to 3%. That match can be less than 3% as long as it is at least 1% and the employer contributes that lower level in no more than two out of five years.\n\nEmployees can contribute a maximum of $16,000 for 2024 and $16,500 for 2025. That contribution cap is increased periodically to account for inflation. Retirement savers age 50 and older may make an additionalcatch-up contributionof $3,500, bringing their annual maximum to $19,500 in 2024 and $20,000 in 2025.\n\nYou can open a traditional IRA as long as you receive taxable compensation during the year in which you want to contribute or your spouse earned taxable compensation, and you will file a joint return. If both you and your spouse have compensation, both parties can open their own traditional IRAs.\n\nA variety of organizations, financial institutions, or brokerage firms can assist in setting up a personal traditional IRA. The account is subject to IRS code requirements, and the custodian of your account (often the brokerage firm you choose, such as Fidelity or Vanguard) will manage the account requirements on your behalf.\n\nContributions into a traditional IRA can be made in the form of cash, check, or money order. Physical property is not an allowable contribution type. When setting up an account, there is no minimum balance or starting investment required.\n\nIf you are saving for retirement with one or more IRAs, you may be working with a financial advisor. In that case, you should know about a new regulation called theRetirement Security Rule. Also known as the fiduciary rule, the rule\u2019s purpose is to protect investors from conflicts of interest when receivinginvestment advicethat the investor uses to build retirement savings.\n\nThe rule was issued by theU.S. Department of Labor (DOL)on April 23, 2024. It took effect in September 2024. However, a one-year transition period will delay the effective date of certain conditions to 2025.\n\nIf an advisor is acting as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), they are subject to the higher standard\u2014the fiduciary best-advice standard rather than the lower, merely suitable advice standard. Their designation can limit the products and services they are allowed to sell to clients who are saving for retirement.\n\nThe primary difference between a traditional and a Roth IRA is the tax treatment of each account. Traditional IRA contributions are deductible from taxable income when the contributions are made. Earnings are tax-deferred while they remain inside the account. Earnings are taxable when withdrawn. Alternatively, Roth contributions are not deductible but can grow tax-free. Contributions can be withdrawn tax-free at any time. Earnings can be withdrawn tax-free and penalty-free if you follow certain rules.\n\nThere are several rules for a traditional IRA. The maximum contribution amount is set every tax year. The age forrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)from traditional IRAs depends on when you were born.\n\nThe traditional IRA is subject to income taxes and a 10% penalty if unqualified withdrawals occur before 59\u00bd years old. Lastly, your annual contribution to a traditional IRA can be, at most, what you earned in the contribution year.\n\nThe two most common types of IRAs are the traditional IRA and Roth IRA. Less popular types of IRAs include SEP IRAs (often best for self-employed or small business owners), SIMPLE IRAs (often best for small companies that still have numerous employees), or self-directed IRAs (often used by experienced investors seeking specific alternative asset investments).\n\nAs with other retirement savings vehicles, traditional IRA funds withdrawn at the wrong time\u2014too soon, and before the account owner reaches a certain age\u2014trigger taxes and penalties unless exemptions apply. For that reason, account owners typically feel compelled to leave money inside a traditional IRA for years, if not decades. In addition, while traditional IRAs do not grow tax-deferred, once earnings are withdrawn, they are subject to tax.\n\nNo, a traditional IRA does not grow tax-free. Contributions to a traditional IRA receive favorable tax treatment and are often deducted from an employee's taxable income. However, when it is time to withdraw earnings, any growth on the investment is taxable. In the meantime, earnings are tax-deferred. This is the mirror-image treatment of Roth IRAs, where initial investments cannot be deducted from income, but their growth can be withdrawn tax-free at retirement.\n\nOne of the more common vehicles used for saving for retirement is the traditional IRA. A traditional IRA allows savers to contribute money into a tax-deferred vehicle using pre-tax (deductible) contributions. Although this investment vehicle can't be accessed until 59\u00bd without taxes and penalties, taxes on the growth of your investment are deferred until then.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics - IRA Contribution Limits.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d Pages 6, 30.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTraditional IRAs.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(k) Limit Increases to $23,500 for 2025, IRA Limit Remains $7,000.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Limit Increases to $23,000 for 2024, IRA Limit Rises to $7,000.\u201d\n\nCongress.gov. \u201cSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019.\u201d Pages 133 Stat. 3137, 3148-3149.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Traditional and Roth IRAs.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics \u2013 Exceptions to Tax on Early Distributions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B (2024), Distributions From Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics \u2014 Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B, Distributions From Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\" Page 7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B, Distributions From Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d Pages 25-28.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B, Distributions From Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d Page 29.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics - Beneficiary.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRA-Based Plans.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Simplified Employee Pension Plan (SEP).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"SIMPLE IRA Plan.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCOLA Increases for Dollar Limitations on Benefits and Contributions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - SIMPLE IRA Contribution Limits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 590-A, Contributions to Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d Pages 6,\u00a09-10.\n\nFederal Register. \"Retirement Security Rule: Definition of an Investment Advice Fiduciary.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Alert: Self-Directed IRAs and the Risk of Fraud.\"",
