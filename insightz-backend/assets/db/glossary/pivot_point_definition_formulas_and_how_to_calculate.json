  "definition": "Pivot points help traders identify support and resistance levels by calculating the average of the previous period's high, low, and closing prices.\n\nOne of the few technical analysis indicators that directly addresses support and resistance levels is pivot points (PPs). They serve as reference points for market sentiment, guiding traders in spotting potential reversals, breakouts, and trend confirmations with objective, mathematically derived price levels.\n\nCalculated from the average of the high, low, and closing prices, PPs provide a structured way to identify market trends.\n\nPPs are calculated using basic mathematics, which includes the previous trading period's high, low, and close prices. The central PP serves as the primary reference level. From there, thesupport and resistancelevels are derived.\n\nP=High+Low+Close3R1=(P\u00d72)\u2212LowR2=P+(High\u2212Low)S1=(P\u00d72)\u2212HighS2=P\u2212(High\u2212Low)where:P=Pivot\u00a0pointR1=Resistance\u00a01R2=Resistance\u00a02S1=Support\u00a01S2=Support\u00a02\\begin{aligned} &P = \\frac{\\text{High} + \\text{Low} + \\text{Close}}{3}\\\\ &R1 = (P \\times 2) - \\text{Low}\\\\ &R2 = P + (\\text{High} - \\text{Low})\\\\ &S1 = (P \\times 2) - \\text{High}\\\\ &S2 = P - (\\text{High} - \\text{Low})\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &P=\\text{Pivot point}\\\\ &R1=\\text{Resistance 1}\\\\ &R2=\\text{Resistance 2}\\\\ &S1=\\text{Support 1}\\\\ &S2=\\text{Support 2}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bP=3High+Low+Close\u200bR1=(P\u00d72)\u2212LowR2=P+(High\u2212Low)S1=(P\u00d72)\u2212HighS2=P\u2212(High\u2212Low)where:P=Pivot\u00a0pointR1=Resistance\u00a01R2=Resistance\u00a02S1=Support\u00a01S2=Support\u00a02\u200b\n\nWhile most trading and analytical software packages can do the PP calculations for you, here is a step-by-step guide on how to calculate them and the corresponding support and resistance levels.\n\nFirst, collect the following from the previous trading periods:\n\nPP is calculated as the average of the high, low, and close points. This acts as the main point of equilibrium betweensupply and demand.\n\nStep 3: Calculate the Support and Resistance Levels\n\nOnce PP is determined, support and resistance levels are also calculated using the formula illustrated above. These levels indicate initial price barriers where the asset or market may either reverse or consolidate.\n\nS2 and R2 represent deeper support and resistance zones, where strong price reactions may occur.\n\nTraders use PPs to help determine predefined support and resistance levels to guide their trading strategies. In addition, traders identify potential price reversals, trend direction, and breakout opportunities:\n\nCombining PPs with other technical analysis indicators can improve trading accuracy by confirming trends, identifying stronger support and resistance levels, and improving breakout validation.Moving averageshelp determine trend direction with confirmation by PPs, signaling bullish or bearish bias.\n\nFibonacci retracements can help confirm any conclusions by highlighting pullback zones, where PPs aligning with levels increase the chances of a price reversal. Volume indicators with price action breaking above or below PP support and resistance levels help confirm the strength of price movements, reducing the risks of false breakouts.\n\nAdditionally, momentum oscillators like the relative strength index (RSI) andstochastic oscillatorcan help with trade timing by identifying overbought and oversold conditions. By integrating these and other technical analysis indicators, traders can create a well-rounded approach that increases confidence in trade execution, helps manage risk, and improves market analysis efficiency.\n\nPPs are a very powerful tool for traders. Below are the advantages of PPs:\n\nHere are the limitations traders should be aware of:\n\nPPs should be used along with other technical analysis indicators and price action analysis to improve accuracy and reliability for better trade validation and risk management.\n\nObjective support and resistance levels\n\nConfirming breakouts and reversals\n\nA forex day trader analyzing the currency pair of the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen (USD/JPY) on a one-hour chart searches for short-term prospects by combining PPs, moving averages (in this case, the 50-SMAand the 200-SMA), andMACDcrossovers. After spotting a bearish SMA crossover, followed by a bearish MACD crossover, the trader gains confidence in a short set up. Further strengthening the case, USD/JPY is trading below its weekly PP, indicating a bearish bias.\n\nWith confirmation in place, the trader enters a short position, setting a stop loss just above the R1 level and targeting a move down to S2.\n\nOver the subsequent few sessions, USD/JPY breaks below S1, initially finding a support zone around S2. There was an attempt to break back above S1, but the price move failed. Next was a wave of selling pressure, and USD/JPY eventually made another leg lower, hitting the trader's profit target at S2 and successfully executing the trade based on technical confluence.\n\nWhile its construction is straightforward, PPs are a powerful tool in technical analysis, helping traders find support and resistance levels, assess market sentiment, and refine trading strategies. They offer clear entry and exit points, though their reliance on historical data and static nature means they work best when combined with other indicators like moving averages, Fibonacci retracements, RSI, and volume analysis.\n\nTimothy Sykes. \"How To Use Pivot Points in Intraday Trading.\" John Wiley & Sons, 2020.\n\nJ.
