  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nRho is the rate at which the price of aderivativechanges relative to a change in the risk-free rate of interest. Rho measures the sensitivity of an option or optionsportfolioto a change ininterest rate. Rho may also refer to the aggregated risk exposure to interest rate changes that exist for abookof several options positions.\n\nFor example, if an option or options portfolio has a rho of 1.0, then for every 1 percentage-point increase in interest rates, the value of the option (or portfolio) increases 1 percent. Options that are most sensitive to changes in interest rates are those that are at-the-money and with the longest time toexpiration.\n\nIn mathematical finance, quantities that measure theprice sensitivityof a derivative to a change in an underlying parameter are known as the \"Greeks.\" The Greeks are important tools inrisk managementbecause they allow a manager,trader, or investor to measure the change in value of an investment or portfolio to a small change in a parameter. More important, this measurement allows the risk to be isolated, thus allowing a manager, trader, or investor to rebalance the portfolio to achieve a desired level of risk relative to that parameter. The most common Greeks aredelta,gamma,vega,theta, and rho.\n\nThe exact formula for rho is complicated. But it is calculated as the first derivative of the option's value with respect to the risk-free rate. Rho measures the expected change in an option's price for a 1 percent change in a U.S.Treasury bill's risk-free rate.\n\nFor example, assume that acall optionis priced at $4 and has a rho of 0.25. If the risk-free rate rises 1 percent, say from 3 percent to 4 percent, the value of the call option would rise from $4 to $4.25.\n\nCall options generally rise in price as interest rates increase and put options generally decrease in price as interest rates increase. Thus, call options have positive rho, while put options have negative rho.\n\nAssume thatput optionis priced at $9 and has a rho of -0.35. If interest rates were to decrease from 5 percent to 4 percent, then the price of this put option would increase from $9 to $9.35. In this same scenario, assuming the call option mentioned above, its price would decrease from $4 to $3.75.\n\nRho is larger for options that are in-the-money and decrease steadily as the option changes to become out-of-the-money. Also, rho increases as the time to expiration increases.Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPs),\u00a0which are options that generally have expiration dates that are greater than one year away, are far more sensitive to changes in the risk-free rate and, thus, have larger rho than shorter-term options.\n\nThough rho is a primary input in theBlack\u2013Scholesoptions-pricing model, a change in interest rates generally has a minor overall impact on the pricing of options. Because of this, rho is usually considered to be the least important of all the option Greeks.",
