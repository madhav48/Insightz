  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nPlatinum is a chemical element, precious metal, and commodity\u00a0that manufacturers use primarily for\u00a0jewelry, electronics, and automobiles. It appears\u00a0on the periodic table of elements by the symbol Pt and atomic number 78.\ufeff\ufeff Platinum futures are commodities contracts traded on the CME'sCOMEXfutures exchange (under symbol PL) and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\u00a0It is also possible to invest in platinum by purchasing shares of anexchange-traded fund that specializes in the commodity.\n\nSpanish general of the navy and scientist Antonio de Ulloa\u00a0introduced platinum to Europe\u00a0in 1735. Due to its silvery or white appearance, Ulloa named the metal plantina, which means littlesilver. Today, platinum is mined in South Africa, which accounts for roughly 80% of the world's production. Russia is the second-biggest producer. About half of the mined platinum from China goes into\u00a0jewelry, where it is desirable because it looks silver in color but does not tarnish. Platinum is also stronger and more durable thangold.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nIn the United States, platinum engagement rings are a popular alternative to white gold engagement rings, which are composed of gold, alloys, and a rhodium plating that gives them a white look. But rhodium fades over time, requiring white gold rings to be replaced, whereas platinum rings maintain their gleam for longer periods of time.\n\nThe auto industry uses platinum\u00a0for catalytic converters, which can help reduce the toxicity of gases and pollutants in the exhaust\u00a0that\u00a0an internal combustion engine creates. Platinum and other platinum-grade metals\u00a0in catalytic converters have\u00a0led to a secondary market for scrap converters, which scrap businesses will buy in order to extract the metal for resale. The metal is also used in thermometers, laboratory equipment, electrodes, and dentistry equipment.\n\nPlatinum is one of the most valuable elements in the world, and considered one of the most costly precious metal commodities. However, while platinum traded at a significantpremiumto gold for decades, it has not since 2008; as a weak global economy put a damper on demand for the precious metal, but investor unease about central bank stimulus and other economic matters sent gold prices higher.\n\nSince thefinancial crisis of 2007-2008, platinum has generally performed worse than other metals like gold, silver, andpalladium. Market observers believe a crash in platinum markets in 2008\u00a0scared the investment class away from the metal, leaving the automobile and jewelry industries as platinum\u2019s only source of demand. In addition, South African mines have substantially increased production of platinum since 2014 and added to global supplies.\n\nRoyal Society of Chemistry. \"Platinum.\" Accessed Mar. 23, 2021.\n\nCME Group. \"Platinum.\" Accessed Mar. 23, 2021.\n\nJapan Exchange Group. \"Commodity Futures Quotes.\" Accessed Mar. 23, 2021.\n\nMineral Council South Africa. \"Platinum.\" Accessed Mar. 23, 2021.\n\nU.S. Geological Survey. \"Platinum-Group Metals in December 2020,\" Page 1.
