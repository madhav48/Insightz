  "term": "Sweep Accounts Definition: Types and How They Work",
  "definition": "A sweep account is a bank or brokerage account that automatically transfers amounts that exceed a certain level into a higher interest-earning investment option at the close of each business day. Commonly, the excess cash is swept into amoney market fund.\n\nUsing a sweep vehicle like a sweep fund works by providing the customer with the greatest amount of interest with the minimum amount of personal intervention by transferring money at the end of the day into a high-interest account. In a sweep program, a bank's computers analyze customer use ofcheckable depositsand sweep funds into money market deposit accounts.\n\nSome brokerage accounts have similar features that enable investors to gain additional returns for unused cash. Sweep accounts are simple mechanisms that allow any money above or below a set threshold in a checking account to be swept into a better investment vehicle. Sweep accounts were needed historically because federal banking regulations prohibited interest on checking accounts.\n\nSweep accounts were originally devised to get around a government regulation that limited banks from offering interest on commercial checking accounts.\n\nSweep accounts, whether for business or personal use, provide a way to ensure money is not sitting idly in a low-interest account when it could be earning higher interest rates in better liquid cash investment vehicles. These investment vehicles that provide higher interest rates while still offeringliquidityinclude money market mutual funds, high-interest investment or savings accounts, and even short-termcertificateswith 30-, 60-, or 90-day maturities for known layovers in investments.\n\nBusinesses and individuals need to monitor the costs of sweep accounts, as the benefit from higher returns from investment vehicles outside the checking account can be offset by the fees charged for the account. Many brokerages or banking institutions charge flat fees, while others charge a percentage of the yield.\n\nSweep accounts may not be free, andbroker feesmay make the account less attractive on a net basis.\n\nBrokerages typically use sweep accounts for individual investors to park money waiting to be reinvested, such as dividends, incoming cash deposits, and money from sell orders. These funds are typically swept into high-interest holding accounts or money market funds until an investor decides on future investments or until thebrokercan execute already-standing orders within the portfolio.\n\nSweep accounts are a typical business tool, especially for small businesses that rely on daily cash flow but want to maximize earning potential on sittingcash reserves. A business sets a minimum balance for its main checking account, over which any funds are swept into a higher-interest investment product. Thebusiness might also use a credit sweepto move the excess funds over to pay down pending lines of credit. If the balance ever dips below the threshold, the funds are swept back into the checking account from the investment account.\n\nDepending on the institution and investment vehicle, the sweep process is generally set daily from the checking account, while the return of funds can experience delays. With the changes in regulations on checking accounts, some banking institutions also offer high-interest rates on amounts over a certain balance.\n\nA sweep account is a type of bank or brokerage account linked to an investment account and automatically transfers funds when the balance is above or below a preset minimum. Typically, this is used to sweep excess cash into a money market fund, where it will earn more interest than an ordinary bank account. Sweep accounts can also work the other way around, moving funds from an investment account to a checking account when the owner's balance falls below a set threshold.\n\nBrokerages typically use individual sweeps to store client funds until the owner decides how to invest the money. For instance, a sweep account might move excess cash to a money market fund, where it will earn greater returns than an ordinary checking account. Small companies with large cash flows often use business sweep accounts. They allow the company to earn interest on excess cash reserves while ensuring they have enough cash to pay for business expenses.\n\nSweep accounts, whether for business or personal use, are an easy way to ensure that money is earning a return rather than sitting in a low-interest bank account.\u00a0Some institutions offer an auto-sweep feature linking the sweep account to the non-sweep account. The transfers are initiated automatically when the defined thresholds (upper and lower) are crossed.\n\nSweep accounts are bank/brokerage accounts that move excess money between a client's cash and investment accounts. When the monetary level in the cash account exceeds the required amount, the excess is automatically moved into the higher interest-bearing investment account. This allows the client account to earn interest on money that isn't being used.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Bulletin: Bank Sweep Programs.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Press Release: Federal Reserve Issues Final Rule To Repeal Regulation Q, Which Prohibited the Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits.\"\n\nNational Archives, Federal Register. \"Prohibition Against Payment of Interest on Demand Deposits.\"",
