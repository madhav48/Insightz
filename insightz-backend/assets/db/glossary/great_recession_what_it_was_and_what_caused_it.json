The economic slump began when the U.S. housing market went from boom to bust, and large amounts of mortgage-backed securities (MBS)\u00a0and derivatives plummeted in value.\n\nThe term \u201cGreat Recession\u201d is a play on the term \u201cGreat Depression\u201d of the 1930s, whengross domestic product (GDP)declined more than 10% andunemploymenthit 25%.\n\nWhile no explicit criteria exist to differentiate adepressionfrom a severe recession, there is a near consensus among economists that the downturn of 2007\u20132009 was not a depression. During the Great Recession, U.S. GDP declined by 0.3%\u00a0in 2008 and 2.8% in 2009, while unemployment briefly reached 10%.\n\nThe term \u201cGreat Recession\u201d applies to both the U.S. recession, officially lasting from December 2007 to June 2009, and the ensuing global recession in 2009.\n\nAccording to a 2011 report by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, the Great Recession was avoidable. The appointees, which included six Democrats and four Republicans, cited several key contributing factors that they determined led to the downturn.\n\nFirst, the report identified failure on the part of the government to regulate the financial industry. This failure to regulate included theFederal Reserve\u2019s inability to stop banks from giving mortgages to people who subsequently proved to be a bad credit risk.\n\nNext, too many financial firms took on too much risk. Theshadow banking system, which included investment firms, grew to rival the depository banking system but was not under the same scrutiny or regulation. When the shadow banking system failed, the collapse impacted the flow of credit to consumers and businesses.\n\nOther causes that the report identified included excessive borrowing by consumers and corporations, along with lawmakers who did not fully understand the collapsing financial system. This created assetbubbles, especially in the housing market, as mortgages were extended at low interest rates to unqualified borrowers who subsequently could not repay them. The ensuing selloff caused housing prices to fall and left many other homeownersunderwater. This, in turn, severely impacted the market for themortgage-backed securitiesthat banks and other institutional investors held.\n\nThe 2001 dot-com bubble implosion, followed by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, hammered the U.S.economy. The Fed responded by cutting interest rates to the lowest levels sinceBretton Woodsto stimulate the economy. The Fed held interest rates low through mid-2004.\n\nCombined with federal policy to encourage homeownership, lowinterest rateshelped spark a boom in real estate and financial markets and a dramatic expansion of the volume oftotal mortgage debt. Financial innovations, such as new types ofsubprimeandadjustable mortgages, allowed borrowers\u2014many of whom otherwise might not have qualified\u2014to obtain home loans on generous terms based on the expectation that interest rates would remain low and home prices would continue to rise.\n\nHowever, from 2004 through 2006, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to controlinflation. As interest rates rose, the flow of newcreditthrough traditional banking channels into real estate slowed. More seriously, rates on existing adjustable mortgages andexoticloans began to reset at much higher rates than many borrowers expected (or were led to expect by lenders). As monthly mortgage payments rose beyond borrowers\u2019 ability to pay (and they could not simply refinance, as prices had stopped steadily rising), many borrowers started to sell. The increase in supply burst what was later widely recognized to be ahousing bubble.\n\nDuring the U.S. housing boom, financial institutions sold mortgage-backed securities\u00a0and complexderivativeproducts at unprecedented levels. When the real estate market collapsed in 2007, these securities declined precipitously in value. The credit markets that had financed the housing bubble quickly followed housing prices into a downturn as acredit crisisbegan unfolding in 2007. Thesolvencyof over-leveraged banks and financial institutions hit a breaking point with the collapse ofBear Stearnsin March 2008.\n\nThings came to a head later that year with the bankruptcy ofLehman Brothers, the country\u2019s fourth-largest investment bank, in September 2008. The contagion quickly spread to other economies around the world, most notably in Europe. As a result of the Great Recession, the United States alone lost more than8.7 millionjobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, doubling the unemployment rate. Further, U.S. households lost roughly $19 trillion innet worthas the stock market plunged, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Great Recession\u2019s official end date was June 2009.\n\nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank Act gave the government control of failing financial institutions and the ability to establish consumer protections against predatory lending.\n\nThe aggressivemonetary policiesthat the Fed took, along with othercentral banksaround the world, was widely credited with preventing even greater damage to the global economy. However, some also criticized the moves, claiming they made the recession last longer and laid the groundwork for laterrecessions.\n\nThe Fed lowered a key interest rate to nearly zero to promoteliquidityand, in an unprecedented move, provided banks with $7.7 trillion of emergency loans in a policy known asquantitative easing (QE).\n\nAlong with the inundation of liquidity, the U.S. federal government embarked on a massive program to stimulate the economy in the form of $787 billion in spending under theAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act(ARRA). It was later raised to $831 billion. These monetary and fiscal policies reduced immediate losses to major financial institutions and large corporations.\n\nNot only did the government introduce stimulus packages, but new financial regulation was also put into place. In the 1990s, the U.S. repealed theGlass-Steagall Act, a Depression-era regulation that separated investment from retail banking to reduce systemic risk. Some economists say this move helped cause the crisis. The repeal allowed some large U.S. banks to merge and form larger institutions, many of which later failed and had to bebailed out.\n\nIn response, in 2010, the U.S. Congress passed and then-President Barack Obama signed theDodd-Frank Act,which gave the government expanded power to regulate the financial sector, including greater control over financial institutions that were deemed on the cusp of failing. It also created consumer protections against predatory lending.\n\nHowever, critics of the Dodd-Frank Act note that the financial sector players and institutions that actively drove and profited from predatory lending and related practices during the housing and financial bubbles were also deeply involved in both the drafting of the new law and with the agencies charged with its implementation.\n\nThe U.S. federal government spent $831 billion (originally $787 billion) to stimulate the economy during the Great Recession under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n\nFollowing these policies, the economy gradually recovered.Real GDPbottomed out in the second quarter of 2009 and regained its pre-recession peak in the second quarter of 2011, 3\u00bd years after the initial onset of the official recession. Financial markets recovered as the flood of liquidity washed over Wall Street.\n\nTheDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which had lost over half its value from its August 2007 peak, began to recover in March 2009 and, four years later\u2014in March 2013\u2014broke its 2007 high.\n\nFor workers and households, the picture was less rosy. Unemployment was at 5% at the end of 2007, reached a high of 10% in October 2009, and did not recover to 5% until 2015, nearly eight years after the beginning of the recession.Real median household incomedid not recover to pre-recession levels until 2016.\n\nCritics of the policy response and how it shaped the recovery argue that the tidal wave of liquidity and deficit spending propped up politically connected financial institutions and big business at the expense of ordinary people. It also may have delayed recovery by tying up economic resources in industries and activities that deserved to fail, when those assets and resources could have been used by other businesses to expand and create jobs.\n\nAccording to official Federal Reserve data, the Great Recession lasted 18 months, from December 2007 through June 2009.\n\nYes, there was a recession from February 2020 to April 2020. It was the shortest recession on record.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at its pre-recession high of 14,164.53. By March 5, 2009, the index had fallen more than 50% to 6,594.44.\n\nOn September 29, 2008, the Dow fell nearly 778 points in one day. It was the largest point drop in history until the market crashed in March 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Great Recession lasted from roughly 2007 to 2009 in the U.S., although the contagion spread around the world, affecting some economies longer. The root cause was excessive mortgage lending to borrowers who normally would not qualify for a home loan, which greatly increased risk to the lender. Lenders were willing to take this risk, as they could simply package the loans into an instrument they sold, passing the risk on to investors.\n\nLow interest rates and poor regulatory oversight following the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act compounded the problem, as credit was cheap and lending institutions had been freed from regulations that would have hampered their ability to mix commercial and investment banking, which Glass-Steagall had separated.\n\nAs the economy imploded and financial institutions failed, the U.S. government launched a massive bailout program, which included assistance for consumers and the many unemployed people via the $787 billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). (It was later increased to $831 billion.) Most credit the bailouts and the ARRA with providing much-needed relief to the public and with saving the financial industry (along with other industries) from total failure. However, some assert the money used to bail out insolvent institutions could have been directed to more productive enterprises rather than using it to save failed ones.\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGross Domestic Product (GDP).\u201d\n\nGovInfo. \u201cThe Financial Crisis Inquiry Report.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cShadow Banks: Out of the Eyes of Regulators.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cFederal Funds Effective Rate (FEDFUNDS).\u201d\n\nCongress.gov, U.S. Congress. \u201cH.R.4173\u2014Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: Text.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cQuantitative Easing: How Well Does This Tool Work?\u201d\n\nNPR. \u201cCongress Approves $787 Billion Stimulus Plan.\u201d\n\nYahoo!
