  "definition": "A volatility swap is a\u00a0forward contract\u00a0with a payoff based on the realizedvolatilityof the underlying asset. They settle in cash based on the difference between the realized volatility and the volatility strike or pre-determined fixed volatility level. Volatility swaps allow participants to trade an asset's volatility without directly trading the underlying asset.\n\nVolatility swaps are not swaps in the traditional sense, with an exchange ofcash flowsbetweencounterparties.\n\nThey are also similar tovariance swaps, where the payoff is based on realized variance.\n\nVolatility swaps are pure volatility instruments allowing investors to speculate solely upon the movement of an underlying asset's volatility without the influence of its price. Thus, just like investorsspeculateon the prices of assets, by using this instrument, investors are able to speculate on how volatile the asset will be.\n\nThe nameswap, in this case, is a misnomer because swaps are structured contracts consisting of cash flow exchanges, typically matching a fixed rate with a variable rate.\u00a0Volatility swaps, and variance swaps, are actuallyforward contractswith payoffs based on the observed or realized variance of the underlying asset.\n\nAt inception, thenotional amountis not exchanged.\n\nThe volatility strike is a fixed number that reflects the market\u2019s expectation of volatility at the time\u00a0the swap begins. In a sense, the volatility strike representsimplied volatility, although it is not the same as traditional implied volatility in options. The strike itself is typically set at the beginning of the swap to make thenet present value(NPV) of the payoff zero. What volatility actually ends up being at the end of the contract determines the payoff, assuming it is different than the implied volatility/volatility strike.\n\nA volatility swap is apure-playon an underlying asset's volatility.Optionsalso give an investor the possibility to\u00a0speculate on an asset's volatility. However, options carry directional risk, and their prices depend on many factors, including time, expiration, and implied volatility. Therefore, the equivalent options strategy requires additional riskhedgingto complete. Volatility swaps don't require this, they are simply based on volatility.\n\nThere are three main classes of users for volatility swaps.\n\nVariance swaps are far more common in equity markets than volatility swaps.\n\nAssume that an institutional trader wants a volatility swap on theS&P 500 index. The contract will expire in twelve months and has a notional value of $1 million. Currently, the implied volatility is 12%. This is set as the strike for the contract.\n\nIn twelve month's time, volatility is 16%. This is the realized volatility. There is a 4% difference, or $40,000 ($1 million x 4%). The seller of the volatility swap pays the swap buyer $40,000, assuming the seller is holding the fixed leg and the buyer the floatingleg.\n\nIf volatility dropped to 10%, the buyer would pay the seller $20,000 ($1 million x 2%).\n\nThis is a simplified example. Since volatility swaps areover-the-counterinstruments (OTC) they can be constructed in different ways. Some alternatives may be to annualize the rates or calculate the difference in volatility in terms of daily changes.",
