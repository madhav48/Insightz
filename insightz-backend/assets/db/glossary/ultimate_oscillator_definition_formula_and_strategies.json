  "definition": "The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that was developed by Larry Williams in 1976 to measure the price momentum of an asset across multiple timeframes. The indicator has lessvolatilityand fewer trade signals compared to other oscillators that rely on a single timeframe because it uses the weighted average of three timeframes.\n\nBuy and sell signals are generated followingdivergences. The Ultimate Oscillator generates fewer divergence signals than other oscillators due to its multi-timeframe construction.\n\n\ufeffUO=[(A7\u00d74)+(A14\u00d72)+A284+2+1]\u00d7100where:UO=Ultimate\u00a0OscillatorA=AverageBuying\u00a0Pressure\u00a0(BP)=Close\u2212Min(Low,PC)PC=Prior\u00a0CloseTrue\u00a0Range\u00a0(TR)=Max(High,Prior\u00a0Close)\u2212True\u00a0Range\u00a0(TR)=Min(Low,Prior\u00a0Close)Average7=\u2211p=17BP\u2211p=17TRAverage14=\u2211p=114BP\u2211p=114TRAverage28=\u2211p=128BP\u2211p=128TR\\begin{aligned} &\\text{UO} = \\left [ \\frac{ ( \\text{A}_7 \\times 4 ) + ( \\text{A}_{14} \\times 2 ) + \\text{A}_{28} }{ 4 + 2 + 1 } \\right ] \\times 100 \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{UO} = \\text{Ultimate Oscillator} \\\\ &\\text{A} = \\text{Average} \\\\ &\\text{Buying Pressure (BP)} = \\text{Close} - \\text{Min} ( \\text{Low}, \\text{PC} ) \\\\ &\\text{PC} = \\text{Prior Close} \\\\ &\\text{True Range (TR) } = \\text{Max} ( \\text{High}, \\text{Prior Close} ) - \\\\ &\\phantom {\\text{True Range (TR) } =} \\text{Min} ( \\text{Low}, \\text{Prior Close} ) \\\\ &\\text{Average}_7 = \\frac{ \\sum_{p=1}^{7} \\text {BP} }{ \\sum_{p=1}^{7} \\text {TR} } \\\\ &\\text{Average}_{14} = \\frac{ \\sum_{p=1}^{14} \\text {BP} }{ \\sum_{p=1}^{14} \\text {TR} } \\\\ &\\text{Average}_{28} = \\frac{ \\sum_{p=1}^{28} \\text {BP} }{ \\sum_{p=1}^{28} \\text {TR} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bUO=[4+2+1(A7\u200b\u00d74)+(A14\u200b\u00d72)+A28\u200b\u200b]\u00d7100where:UO=Ultimate\u00a0OscillatorA=AverageBuying\u00a0Pressure\u00a0(BP)=Close\u2212Min(Low,PC)PC=Prior\u00a0CloseTrue\u00a0Range\u00a0(TR)=Max(High,Prior\u00a0Close)\u2212True\u00a0Range\u00a0(TR)=Min(Low,Prior\u00a0Close)Average7\u200b=\u2211p=17\u200bTR\u2211p=17\u200bBP\u200bAverage14\u200b=\u2211p=114\u200bTR\u2211p=114\u200bBP\u200bAverage28\u200b=\u2211p=128\u200bTR\u2211p=128\u200bBP\u200b\u200b\ufeff\n\nThe Ultimate Oscillator\u00a0is a range-bound indicator with a\u00a0value that fluctuates between 0 and 100. Levels below 30 are deemed to beoversoldand levels above 70 are deemed to beoverbought, similar to theRelative Strength Index\u00a0(RSI). Trading\u00a0signals are generated when the price moves in the opposite direction as\u00a0the indicator and they're based on a three-step method.\n\nLarry Williams developed the\u00a0Ultimate Oscillator in 1976 and published it in Stocks & Commodities Magazine in 1985.With many momentum oscillatorscorrelatingtoo heavily to near-term price movements, Williams developed the Ultimate Oscillator to incorporate multiple timeframes to smooth out the indicator's movements and provide a more reliable indicator ofmomentumwith fewer false divergences.\n\nFalse divergences are common in oscillators that only use one timeframe because the oscillator surges when the price surges. The oscillator tends to fall, forming a divergence even though the price may still betrendingstrongly, even if the price continues to rise.\n\nWilliams recommended a three-step approach for the indicator to generate a buy signal:\n\nWilliams created the same three-step method for sell signals:\n\nThe Ultimate Oscillator has three lookback periods or timeframes. TheStochastic Oscillatorhas only one. The Ultimate Oscillator doesn't typically include asignal line, although one could be added. The Stochastic does. Both indicators generate trade signals based on divergence but the signals will be different due to the different calculations.\n\nThe Ultimate Oscillator uses a three-step method for trading divergence.\n\nThe three-step trading method for the indicator may help eliminate some poor trades but it also eliminates many good ones. Divergence isn't present at all price reversal points and a reversal won't always occur from overbought or oversold territory. Waiting for the oscillator to move above the divergence high (bullish divergence) or below the divergence low (bearish divergence) could mean a poor entry point as the price may have already run significantly in the reversal direction.\n\nAs with all indicators, the Ultimate Oscillator shouldn't be used in isolation but rather as part of a complete trading plan. Such a plan will typically include other forms of analysis such asprice analysis, other technical indicators, and/orfundamental analysis.\n\nA technical indicator uses historical data to anticipate price trends and pin down entry and exit points. The data includes price and volume. It's not a single mathematical approach. You can choose from various versions of technical indicators depending on your goals and needs.\n\nTechnical indicators can focus on various issues. Some of the more popular and well-known include the RSI (oscillator), the Bollinger Bands indicator (volatility), and the Fibonacci retracement (support and resistance). The best tool for you is the one that focuses on your concerns and your goals.\n\nThe Relative Strength Index (RSI) measures the speed and range of price movements on a scale from zero to 100 but 70 and 30 are considered to be the pivotal numbers. An RSI above 70 is flagged as overbought and one below 30 is considered oversold.\n\nJ. Welles Wilder introduced the RSI in 1978.\n\nThe Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that focuses on three timeframes: seven, 14, and 28 periods. It has less volatility and fewer trade signals because it doesn\u2019t rely on a single timeframe. It uses the weighted average of all three. The 28 period carries the least weight.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to be very sure that you understand the calculation and math before you wade in and use this or any other indicator. Consider touching base with a professional if you\u2019re even a little unsure.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
