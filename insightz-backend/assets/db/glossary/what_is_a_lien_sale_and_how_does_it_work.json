  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA lien sale is the sale of the claim\u2014or a hold\u2014placed on an asset to satisfy an unpaid debt. Typically, lien sales are conducted as publicauctions, and the lien is on real estate, automobiles, and other personal property.\n\nDepending on a particular state's laws, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers may put a lien on a piece of property they have worked on pending payment for services rendered.\n\nBuyingdelinquenttax liens at a sale is becoming an increasingly popular form of investing and is similar to purchasing a long-termcertificate of deposit(CD). However, unlike a CD, tax liens cannot be sold back to the taxing authority and must be held until they are repaid. Investors mustlearn the ins and outs of investing in tax liensbefore investing in them. Redemption of the purchased lien is typically at a given rate of return within a specified time frame.\n\nLien sales for unpaid debts on a property can result in the amount owed increasing further. When the lien debt is sold, usually by a local government agency, the buyer can employ a lien servicing company that may add more fees and interest to the lien. This allows the buyer to see a return on their investment as the debtor must now pay the additional costs imposed.\n\nIn many instances, several notices of an impending lien sale will be sent to the debtor before a notice is filed stating the approaching date for the auction. Although a debtor may owe taxes and other fees, there can be exceptions that will shelter their property and other assets from being subject to a lien sale. For example, disabled homeowners, senior citizens, and veterans could receive exemptions.\n\nActive duty military personnel might also be eligible for an exemption for lien sales on their property. Each jurisdiction will have its own criteria, application process, and window of time when the responsible agency must be contacted.\n\nThere are limits to the interest rate amounts that a lien buyer can impose. Interest rate limits are set at the government level and vary by state. The bidding process is auction-style, with the winner being the highest bidder. Because there is a limit to the maximum interest rate a winning bidder can charge, the amount the buyer pays for the lien is paramount.\n\nBuying a home with a lien on it is not without complications.\n\nAs mentioned before, there's different types of auctions that may sell different types of liens. These types of liens may include:\n\nImagine a tenant who faces financial difficulties and falls behind on rent payments for her storage unit. The storage facility issues a lien notice, notifying the tenant of the overdue rent and the imposition of a lien on her stored items. Despite providing the tenant with a redemption period, during which she could settle the outstanding rent and fees, she is unable to do so.\n\nAs the redemption period expires, the storage facility proceeds with a lien sale auction. Prospective buyers attend the auction where they can only inspect the storage unit from the outside. The highest bidder wins ownership of the unit's contents. The winning bidder gains possession of the items stored by the tenant, marking the conclusion of the lien sale.\n\nThe proceeds from the auction are utilized to cover the overdue rent, associated fees, and any additional costs incurred during the lien process. This makes the storage unit owner whole. If there are surplus funds after settling the outstanding balance, they may be returned to the tenant.\n\nOwners of property that is subject to a lien sale can have their property removed from such sale by making payment arrangements to bring their outstanding debt up to date.\n\nThere may be special procedures for different types of lien sales, such as an auction for a vehicle of a certain value. How that is handled can differ from a lien sale for the contents of a self-storage unit if the owner fails to pay their bills to the storage company on time. Notices for lien sales might be posted online by the overseeing local agency or in local newspapers.\n\nJudicial lien sales are initiated by court order, often arising from a legal judgment or debt. The court authorizes the sale of property or assets to satisfy the judgment, ensuring that the creditor receives the funds owed.\n\nProperty owners typically have certain rights during a lien sale process. These may include receiving clear and timely notices, having a redemption period to settle debts and reclaim the property, and the ability to contest the sale under certain circumstances.\n\nYes, redemption periods are crucial elements in lien sales. They provide debtors with a specified time frame to settle the outstanding amount and reclaim ownership of their property before it is sold at auction. The duration of the redemption period varies based on the type of lien sale and local regulations.\n\nLien sales involve a legal process where a lienholder sells a debtor's property or assets to recover unpaid debts. This process typically includes the imposition of a lien, notices to the debtor, and the auctioning of the property, with proceeds used to satisfy the outstanding obligations.",
