  "term": "Competitive Advantage Definition With Types and Examples",
  "definition": "Competitive advantage refers to the factors that allow a company to produce goods or services better or more cheaply than its rivals.\n\nA competitive advantage is the unique edge that allows companies to outperform their competitors through greater efficiency, superior quality, or a distinctive offering others cannot easily replicate. These factors allow the productive entity to generate more sales or superior margins than others in its market.\n\nCompetitive advantages are attributed to a variety of factors,\u00a0including cost structure,branding, the quality of product offerings, the\u00a0distribution network, intellectual property, and customer service.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nCompetitive advantages generate greater value for a firm and its shareholders\u00a0because of certain strengths or conditions. The more sustainable the competitive advantage, the more difficult it is for competitors to neutralize the advantage. The two main types of competitive advantages arecomparative advantageand differential advantage.\n\nA comparative advantage is when a firm can produce products more efficiently and at a lower cost than its competitors. A differential advantage is\u00a0when a firm's products or services differ from its competitors' offerings and are seen as superior. Advanced technology, patent-protected products or processes, superior personnel, and strong brand identity are all drivers of differential advantage. These factors support wide margins and large market shares.\n\nThe term \"competitive advantage\" traditionally refers to the business world, but it can also be applied to a country, organization, or even an individual who's competing for something.\n\nApple is famous for creating innovative products such as\u00a0the iPhone and supporting its market leadership with savvy marketing campaigns to build an elite brand. Major drug companies are another example. They can market branded drugs at high price points because they're protected by patents.\n\nCompeting on price can be effective, but you risk decreasing profit margins to an untenable level if you slash prices too much. Many firms opt to differentiate themselves in other ways instead, which helps preserve or expand their profit margin.\n\nA company can use one of three main methods to build a competitive advantage:\n\nA company must know what sets it apart from its competitors and then focus its message, service, and products with that difference in mind. Companies can use several strategies to build a competitive advantage:\n\nA firm's ability to produce a good or service more efficiently than its competitors leads to greater profit margins and creates a comparative advantage. Rational consumers will choose the cheaper of anytwo perfect substitutesthat are offered.\n\nA car owner will\u00a0buy gasoline from a\u00a0gas station that's five cents cheaper\u00a0than other stations in the area. Higher margins for the lowest-cost producers can eventually bring superior returns for imperfect substitutes like Pepsi versus Coke.\n\nEconomies of scale, efficient internal systems, and geographic location can also create a comparative advantage.\n\nComparative advantage doesn't imply a\u00a0better product or service. It only shows that the firm can offer a product or service of the same value at\u00a0a lower price.\n\nA firm that manufactures a product in China may have lower labor costs than a company that manufactures in the U.S., so it can offer an equal product at a lower price. Opportunity cost\u00a0determines comparative advantages in the context of international trade economics.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\u00a0is an example of a company that's focused on building and maintaining a comparative advantage. The e-commerce platform\u00a0has a level of scale and efficiency that's difficult for retail competitors to replicate, allowing it to\u00a0rise\u00a0to prominence largely through price competition.\n\nA company will have a competitive advantage over its rivals if it can increase its market share through increased efficiency or productivity.\n\nLasting competitive advantages tend to be things that competitors can't easily replicate or imitate. Warren Buffett calls sustainable competitive advantageseconomic moatsthat businesses can figuratively dig around themselves to entrench competitive advantages. This can include strengthening one's brand, raising barriers to new entrants, such as through regulations, and the defense of intellectual property.\n\nCompetitive advantages that accrue from economies of scale typically refer to supply-side advantages such as the purchasing power of a large restaurant or retail chain. Advantages of scale also exist on the demand side, however. They're commonly referred to asnetwork effects.\u00a0This happens when a service becomes more valuable to all its users as the service adds more users. The result can often be a winner-take-all dynamic in the industry.\n\nComparative advantage refers mostly to international trade. A country should focus on what it can produce and export relatively cheaply. A country should only produce product A if it can do it better than B, and import B from some other country if one country has a competitive advantage in producing both products A & B.\n\nA company's competitive advantage is the way it excels compared to its rivals. This advantage might be through cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. Identifying a company's competitive advantage helps show how it's positioned to be more successful than its competitors, creating more revenue and generating greater profits.\n\nThe Library of Economics and Liberty. \"Comparative Advantage.\"\n\nUniversity of Cambridge. \"Porter's Generic Competitive Strategies (Ways of Competing).\"\n\nMorningstar. \"What Makes an Attractive Warren Buffett Stock?\"",
