  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nMunicipal bonds are debt instruments that local, county, and state governments issue to raise funds for public projects, including the construction of highways, bridges, or schools.\n\nMunicipal bonds act like loans, with bondholders becoming creditors. In exchange for borrowed capital, bondholders/investors are promised interest on their principal balance, the latter being repaid by the maturity date. Municipal bonds are often exempt from most taxes, which makes them attractive to people in higher income tax brackets.\n\nTypes of municipal bonds include general obligation and revenue bonds.\n\nA municipal bond is a debt obligation issued by a nonprofit organization, a private-sector corporation, or anotherpublic entity using the loan for public projects, such as constructing schools, hospitals, and highways.\n\nMunicipal bonds, which are also known as muni bonds or munis, cangenerate tax-free incomefor qualified residents butpay lower coupon (interest) ratesas a result compared with taxable bonds.\n\nA municipal bond is categorized based on the source of its interest payments and principal repayments. A bond can be structured in different ways, offering various benefits, risks, and tax treatments. Income generated by a municipal bond may be taxable. For example, amunicipality may issue a bondnot qualified for federal tax exemption, resulting in the generated income being subject to federal taxes.\n\nThe value of municipal bonds outstanding as of Q3 2024.\n\nDefault riskis low for municipal bonds compared with corporate bonds.However, revenue bonds are more vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes or general economic downturns than GO bonds. For example, a facility delivering water, treating sewage, or providing other fundamental services has more dependable revenue than a park\u2019s rentable shelter area.\n\nAs afixed-income security, the market price of a municipal bond fluctuates with changes in interest rates: When interest rates rise, bond prices decline; when interest rates decline, bond prices rise.\n\nIn addition, a bond with a longer maturity is more susceptible to interest rate changes than a bond with a shorter maturity, causing even greater changes in the municipal bond investor\u2019s income. Furthermore, the majority of municipal bonds are illiquid; an investor needing immediate cash has to sell other securities instead.\n\nMany municipal bonds carrycall provisions, allowing the issuer to redeem the bond prior to the maturity date. An issuer typically calls a bond when interest rates drop and reissues municipal bonds at a lower interest rate. When a bond is called, investors lose income from interest payments and face reinvesting in a bond with a lower return.\n\nMost municipal bonds are issued in $5,000 increments. Municipal bonds may be included in someexchange-traded funds (ETFs)as well as mutual funds, allowing investors to purchase bond fractions.\n\nMunicipal bonds are available in a variety of terms ranging from short-term (a few years) and long-term (decade or more).\n\nAlthough municipal bonds may have lower interest rates than riskier investments like corporate bonds or stocks, they offer stability for your capital with low default rates. Interest from munis is also generally exempt from federal taxes,making it an attractive investment.\n\nMunicipal bonds are debt instruments issued by local governments to finance the needs of a community, such as the building of a community center or park. They offer investors a low-risk investment of fixed income and can be a good option to diversify a bond portfolio.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"What are Municipal Bonds.\"\n\nMunicipal Securities Rulemaking Board. \"Ways to Buy Municipal Bonds.\" Pages 1-2.\n\nSecurities Industry and Financial Markets Association. \u201cU.S. Municipal Bonds Statistics.\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cBonds: Types.\u201d",
