If, however, a company has a healthy amount of levered free cash flow, it then becomes a more attractive investment and a low-risk borrower.\n\nEven if a company\u2019s levered free cash flow is negative, it does not necessarily indicate that the company is failing.

A company may choose to devote a substantial amount of its levered free cash flow to dividend payments or for investment in the company. If, on the other hand, the company\u2019s management perceives an important opportunity for growth and market expansion, it may choose to devote nearly all of its levered free cash flow to funding potential growth.\n\nLevered free cash flow is the amount of cash a business has after paying debts and other obligations. Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is the amount of cash a company has prior to making its debt payments. UFCF is calculated as EBITDA minus CapEx minus working capital minus taxes.\n\nLFCF is the cash flow available to pay shareholders, while UFCF is the money available to pay shareholders and debtholders.
