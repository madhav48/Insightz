  "term": "What Is a Roth 401(k)?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan funded using after-tax dollars.\n\nA Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement savings account that is funded using after-tax dollars. This means that income tax is paid immediately on the earnings that the employee deducts from each paycheck and deposits into the account. As long as certain conditions are met\u2014that is, you must be at least 59\u00bd years old, and you must have had the account for at least five years\u2014withdrawals from the account aretax freeupon retirement.\n\nThis type of plan is different from a traditional401(k)plan, which is funded with pretax money. In this case, payroll deductions come out of the employee\u2019s gross income and taxes are due when the money is withdrawn from the account.\n\nInvestors have many options when it comes to saving for retirement. One of the most common ways to put money aside is through employer-sponsored plans like the401(k). Participation is voluntary and those who take part agree to automaticpayroll deductionsthat are transferred into a special retirement account. Some employers evenmatch employee contributionsup to a certain amount.\n\nThere areseveral varieties of 401(k)s. The Roth 401(k) option became available at the beginning of 2006, while the traditional 401(k) has been around since 1978. Both were authorized by Congress astax-advantagedretirement plans to encourage employees to save for their retirement.\n\nTheir tax advantages are different:\n\nThe number of plan sponsors that offer a Roth 401(k) option, as surveyed by the Transamerica Institute at the end of 2022.\n\nA Roth 401(k) is subject to contribution limits based on the individual\u2019s age. These limits are adjusted annually forinflationand released by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe contribution limit for individuals is $23,500 in 2025. Individuals 50 and older can contribute an additional $7,500 as acatch-up contribution. In 2024, the contribution limit was $23,000, and the catch-up contribution was $7,500. Unlike other plans, there is no income limit to participate.\n\nNote that you cannot contribute more than your taxable income for the year.\n\nWithdrawals of any contributions and earnings are not taxed as long as the withdrawal is aqualified distribution, which means certain criteria must be met. This means that:\n\nThe IRS has updated the rules forrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)for 2024:\n\nKeep in mind that individuals can withdraw more than the RMD. But there is a penalty if you miss an RMD or if your withdrawal is less than outlined during a calendar year. Previously 50% of the value of the missed withdrawal, this penalty is now 25% of the missed withdrawal\u2019s value. You can reduce the amount of the penalty to 10% if you fix the mistake before the date that the penalty is imposed, which is known as the correction window.\n\nA Roth 401(k) may have the greatest benefit for employees currently in a low tax bracket who expect to move into a higher one after they retire. Contributions made to a Roth 401(k) are taxed at the lowertax rate. Distributions are tax free in retirement, making them the greatest single advantage. No matter how much the account grows over the years, that money is still exempt from income taxes after the account holder retires.\n\nThe downside is a little more immediate financial pain. Because contributions to a traditional 401(k) are not taxed immediately (but effectively reduce the amount of your gross income), the impact on your take-home pay is reduced and your tax break for the year is maximized. But there\u2019s no such deal with a Roth 401(k). This means that you are out of pocket for (and taxed on) the deposits you make in the year you make them.\n\nHelps people who believe they\u2019ll be in a higher tax bracket later in life\n\nDistributions are tax free during retirement\n\nContributions are made using after-tax dollars\n\nContributions don\u2019t reduce your taxable income\n\nA Roth 401(k) is an employer-sponsored plan that helps people prepare for retirement. But it\u2019s not the only option available to investors.\n\nA defined contribution plan like a 401(k) may not be sufficient to meet your retirement needs.\n\nLike its Roth equivalent, thetraditional 401(k)is an employer-sponsored plan. This means you can\u2019t set one up on your own. Money is taken out of your paycheck through automatic deductions and transferred into a special account. The money is then invested in a series ofmutual fundsthat you choose.\n\nThe IRS sets limits on how much you can contribute to the plan each year. This figure is adjusted annually for inflation.\n\nEmployers can also contribute to their employees\u2019 plans, as long as the total contribution does not exceed the employee\u2019s annual salary. The limit for employer and employee contributions together is capped at $70,000 in 2025, or $77,500 including the catch-up contribution. For 2024, those limits were $69,000 and $76,500, respectively.\n\nThis plan is adefined contribution plan, which means your contributions determine the account balance and how well your account performs. Contributions are made usingpretax dollars, reducing the income tax you pay. Withdrawals made during retirement are subject to income tax.\n\nIf you don\u2019t have the option to invest in an employer-sponsored plan, you may want to consider anindividual retirement account (IRA). This kind of account can be set up by anyone through a financial institution or investment firm, which means anyone who has earned income is entitled to one.\n\nUnlike a Roth 401(k), a Roth IRA is not subject to required minimum distributions.\n\nYou can invest in a variety of investments under an IRA, includingstocks,bonds,exchange-traded funds (ETFs), mutual funds, andreal estate investment trusts (REITs). Just like the 401(k), there are several types of IRA options available:\n\nYou can also choose aSimplified Employee Pension (SEP) IRAor aSavings Incentive Match Plan for Employees (SIMPLE) IRAif you\u2019re self-employed or work for a small business.\n\nThese plans are just like the 401(k) but are sponsored by employers for individuals who work in schools and othertax-exemptorganizations. This includes teachers, professors, clergy people, government employees, and librarians.\n\n403(b)s come with regular payroll deductions, and potentially additional contributions by the employer.\n\nThese plans have the same contribution limits as 401(k) plans. You can contribute a maximum of $23,500 in 2025, and $23,000 in 2024. People 50 and older can make an additional contribution of $7,500 in 2024 and in 2025. If you are age 60, 61, 62, or 63, you can contribute an additional $11,250 instead of $7,500.\n\nRoth 401(k) plans are only available through an employer, which means you can\u2019t set one up yourself. Contributions are made using after-tax dollars through payroll deductions. The contributions grow tax free in your account. Withdrawals are also tax free as long as you\u2019ve held the account for at least five years and you\u2019re at least 59\u00bd.\n\nYour personal circumstances can help answer that question. For many people, the Roth 401(k) is a better deal because you only pay income taxes on your contributions. This allows your earnings to grow tax free and make withdrawals without paying income taxes. However, if you\u2019re cash-strapped now, keep in mind that this option will be a heavier hit to your current annual income than a traditional 401(k).\n\nContributions to a traditional 401(k) are tax free, but you must pay taxes on your withdrawals. So if you expect to be in a lower tax bracket after retiring,the immediate tax break of a traditional 401(k)will likely be more useful.However, it\u2019s difficult to predict what income tax rates will be in the future.\n\nA withdrawal is only considered a qualified distribution as long as you\u2019ve held the account for at least five years and you\u2019re 59\u00bd, unless you are disabled or the account holder dies.\n\nYou can lose money in any investment if the market tanks. That said, most plans offer several funds, includingvery low-risk optionslike government bond funds. You can mix and match choices to reach the level of risk you are comfortable taking.\n\nYou can also lose money in a Roth 401(k) if you break the rules and take early distributions. If you\u2019re considering taking some money out early, check with the fund administrator to find out whether you might owe a tax penalty.\n\nRoth 401(k) plans allow a company\u2019s employees tostart investing for retirement. Both the traditional 401(k) and the Roth version may offer an employer match. However, there is a big difference between the two: Whereas a traditional 401(k) is funded using after-tax dollars, translating to a tax break upfront, a Roth is funded using after-tax dollars, meaning that there are no income taxes when you takedistributionsduring retirement.\n\nInvestor.gov, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cTraditional and Roth 401(k) Plans.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cEmployee Costs and Risks in 401(k) Plans,\u201d Page 12.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cAnother Retirement Savings Option: Roth 401(k) Plan.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cBeyond the Numbers,\u201d Page 8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRoth Comparison Chart.\u201d\n\nTransamerica Institute. \u201cStepping into the Future: Employers, Workers, and the Multigenerational Workforce,\u201d Page 22.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Limit Increases to $23,000 for 2024, IRA Limit Rises to $7,000.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plans FAQs on Designated Roth Accounts.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c2024 Limitations Adjusted as Provided in Section 415(d), etc.,\u201d Page 1.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cThe Beginner\u2019s Guide to 401(k)s.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIndividual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 451, Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRC 403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"401(k) Limit Increases to $23,500 for 2025, IRA Limit Remains $7,000.\"\n\nCongress.gov, U.S. Congress. \u201cH.
