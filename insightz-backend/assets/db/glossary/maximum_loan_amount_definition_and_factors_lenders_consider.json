  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA maximum loan amount, or loan limit, describes the total amount of money that an applicant is authorized to borrow. Maximum loan amounts are used for standard loans, credit cards, and line-of-credit accounts.\n\nThe maximum will depend on several factors, including a borrower's creditworthiness, loan length, loan purpose, whether the loan is backed by collateral, and various criteria of the lender.\n\nA maximum loan amount for a borrower is based on a combination of factors and determined by a loanunderwriter. It is the maximum amount of money that will be provided to a borrower if the loan is approved. Lenders consider a borrower\u2019sdebt-to-incomeratio during the underwriting process, which helps to determine how much they believe the borrower would be able to repay and therefore what the maximum loan amount should be. Lenders generally seek borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of 36% or less.\n\nLenders must also consider their own risk parameters when determining a borrower\u2019s total principal. Thus, maximum loan amounts can also be based on the risk diversification of a lender.\n\nIn addition to the applicant's debt-to-income ratio, underwriters take into account a variety of factors, including credit score and credit history, in determining the maximum loan amount an applicant can borrow.\n\nCredit cards are an example of unsecured lending. Credit card issuers also use underwriting to determine how much they trust a borrower to repay\u2014the maximum loan amount or credit limit. One of the primary factors they consider is credit history, which includes repayment history, the number of credit accounts on a report, and the length of a person's credit history. Credit card issuers will also check the number of inquiries on a credit report and the derogatory marks, which include bankruptcies, collections, civil judgments, and tax liens. They also may take into account an applicant's work history.\n\nPersonal loansare also available unsecured. Banks,peer-to-peer (P@P) websites, and other lenders use credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other types of underwriting to set the rates at which they are willing to lend money. The better your credit rating, the better the rates you will be offered; people with excellent credit are offered much lower rates than those with bad credit.\n\nPersonallines of credit(LOC)are another form of unsecured loan, which gives you access to money you can borrow when you need it\u2014and there's no interest until you borrow. Having better credit scores may help you qualify for a lower annual percentage rate.\n\nWithsecured loans\u2014specifically mortgage loans\u2014lenders use an additionalqualifying ratiocalled thehousing expense ratio, which compares the borrower's housing expenses to their pre-tax income. Housing expenses generally include the potential mortgage principal and interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, and association fees. Lenders will typically look for a housing expense ratio no higher than 28%. Similar to standard loans, secured lenders will also analyze a borrower\u2019s debt-to-income with 36% being the common threshold required.\n\nThey also base a maximum loan amount on customized loan-to-value thresholds. Secured lenders will often lend between 70%-90% of a secured asset\u2019scollateral value. Mortgage loans generally follow standard underwriting procedures with these variables also a part of the decision on how much to lend to a borrower.\n\nAhome-equity line of credit (HELOC)is another form of secured lending. As its name implies, the maximum loan amount is based on the equity you have in your home. If you need money, it can be a better choice than a credit card because the interest rate may be lower and the amount you can borrow higher. If you have trouble paying back what you borrow, however, you can risk losing your home.\n\nGovernment-sponsored loans offer some exceptions to the underwriting requirements and maximum loan amounts for certain types of home loans. These loans may accept borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of up to 50%.In the mortgage industry, theFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)publishes the maximum amounts for loans sponsored by Fannie Mae.Freddie Macalso publishes loan limits annually. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee a large percentage of mortgages originated in the United States, the \"conforming loan limit\"\u2014that is, loans that conform to these entities' guidelines\u2014is an important number in the mortgage finance industry.\n\nThe maximum conforming loan limit for one-unit properties in 2024 in most parts of the U.S. The limit increased from $726,200 in 2023.\n\nLenders will consider several factors including credit score, debt-to-income ratio, the purpose of the loan, the type of loan, and more. In general, the lower your debt-to-income ratio and the higher your credit score, the higher you can expect the maximum loan amount to be.\n\nCredit score is one of the biggest factors.Scores of 800 or greater generally are considered excellent, while 740\u2013799 is considered very good, and 670\u2013739 qualifies as good. The lower an applicant's score, the more difficult it will be to get approved. Those with good but not excellent credit may still be approved, but they are more likely to pay higher interest rates.\n\nA loan-to-value ratio measures how much of an asset is financed compared to the overall value of the asset. For example, if you take out a $400,000 mortgage to purchase a $500,000 home, theloan-to-value ratiowould be 80%. What constitutes a good maximum loan-to-value ratio depends on the type of loan. Some homebuying programs allow buyers to put down as little as 3%, meaning the loan-to-value ratio would be 97%\u2014but that can be risky for the borrower if the value of the home decreases due to market conditions or other factors.\n\nWhen lenders approve a loan or a line of credit, it typically comes with a maximum loan amount. This is the maximum amount of money that can be borrowed. What the maximum loan amount will be depends on multiple factors such as the borrower's creditworthiness and the type and purpose of the loan.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Debt-to-Income Calculator,\" Page 2.\n\nFannie Mae. \"What Is the Maximum DTI Ratio Allowed?\"\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \u201cFHFA Announces Conforming Loan Limit Values for 2024.\u201d\n\nmyFICO. \u201cWhat Is a FICO\u00ae Score?\u201d",
