  "term": "Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit (GMAB): Meaning, Overview",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit (GMAB) is avariable annuityrider that guarantees a minimum value to the\u00a0annuitant after theaccumulation periodor another set period, usually somewhere close to 10 years. The GMAB rider protects the value of the\u00a0annuity from market fluctuations. This optional benefit is available for an additional cost, which varies per insurance provider.\n\nThe guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit will only be used if the\u00a0annuity\u2019smarket valuefalls below the minimum guaranteed value. In certain scenarios, the cumulative costs of the benefit are returned to the\u00a0annuity\u00a0if the value of the annuity is higher than the minimum benefit, eliminating the need to use the rider.\n\nIn addition to the guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit, which restrictswithdrawalsuntil after the accumulation period, other guaranteed minimum living benefit riders may or may not have a holding period or require annuitization. These include a guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) and a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB).\n\nAdditionally, there are two other riders: a\u00a0guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit and a standalone lifetime benefit.\n\nA guaranteed minimum income benefit (GMIB) guarantees the annuitant a minimum income during retirement, offering protection against market volatility. If the investor annuitizes the contract, payments will be based on the amount in the fund and a set interest rate. This kind of rider is subject to both age limits and holding periods.\n\nA guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit (GMWB) is a hybrid product that guarantees that a percentage of the retirement fund will be eligible for annual withdrawals until the depletion of the initial investment. Percentages vary but typically range from 5% to 10%.\u00a0The amount available for withdrawal may have age restrictions.\n\nIf the investments perform well, annuitants can take advantage of a step-up option, securing higher guaranteed withdrawals.\u00a0A guaranteed lifetime withdrawal benefit (GLWB), also considered a hybrid product, guarantees an investor a specific percentage of the fund\u2019s value for withdrawal during their lifetime, offering further protection against market fluctuations. A GLWB is sometimes called a GMWB with a lifetime option.\n\nA standalone lifetime benefit (SALB) is similar to the GLWB but doesn\u2019t require the purchase of an annuity. Generally, an investor wanting access to their funds would have toannuitizeor face penalties. The SALB offers lifetime access to the\u00a0fund, regardless of market performance, with fees and certain restrictions.\n\nU.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \"Guaranteed Minimum Accumulation Benefit Rider (GMAB).\"\n\nU.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \"Guaranteed Minimum Income Benefit (GMIB).\"\n\nU.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \"Guaranteed Minimum Withdrawal Benefit Rider.\"\n\nU.S. Securities Exchange Commission. \"Guaranteed Lifetime Withdrawal Benefit Rider (GLWB).\"",
