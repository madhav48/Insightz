  "term": "Enterprise Risk Management (ERM): What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "Michela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nEnterprise risk management (ERM) is a methodology that looks at risk management strategically from the perspective of the entire firm or organization. It is a top-down strategy that aims to identify, assess, and prepare for potential losses, dangers, hazards, and other potentials for harm that may interfere with an organization\u2019s operations and objectives and/or lead to losses.\n\nEnterprise risk management takes a holistic approach and calls for management-level decision making that may not necessarily make sense for an individual business unit or segment. Thus, instead of each business unit being responsible for its own risk management, firm-wide surveillance is given precedence.\n\nIt also often involves making the risk plan of action available to all stakeholders as part of an annual report. Industries as varied as aviation, construction, public health, international development, energy, finance, and insurance all have shifted to utilize ERM.\n\nERM, therefore, can work to minimize firm-wide risk as well as identify unique firm-wide opportunities. Communicating and coordinating between different business units are key for ERM to succeed, since the risk decision coming from top management may seem at odds with local assessments on the ground. Firms that utilize ERM will typically have a dedicated enterprise risk management team that oversees the workings of the firm.\n\nWhile ERM best practices and standards are still evolving, they have been formalized through COSO, an industry group that maintains and updates such guidance for companies and ERM professionals.\n\nERM-friendly firms may be attractive to investors because they signal more stable investments.\n\nModern businesses face a diverse set of risks and potential dangers. In the past, companies traditionally handled their risk exposures via each division managing its own business. Enterprise risk management calls for corporations to identify all the risks they face. It also makes management decide which risks to manage actively. As opposed to risks being siloed across a company, a company sees the bigger picture when using ERM.\n\nERM looks at each business unit as a \u201cportfolio\u201d within the firm and tries to understand how risks to individual business units interact and overlap. It is also able to identify potential risk factors that are unseen byanyindividual unit.\n\nCompanies have been managing risk for years. Traditional risk management has relied on each business unit evaluating and handling its own risk and then reporting back to the CEO at a later date. More recently, companies have started to recognize the need for a more holistic approach.\n\nAchief risk officer (CRO), for instance, is a corporate executive position that is required from an ERM standpoint. The CRO is responsible for identifying, analyzing, and mitigating internal and external risks that impact the entire corporation.\n\nThe CRO also works to ensure that the company complies with government regulations, such asSarbanes-Oxley (SOX), and reviews factors that could hurtinvestmentsor a company\u2019s business units. The CRO\u2019s mandate will be specified in conjunction with other top management along with the board of directors and other stakeholders.\n\nA good indication that a company is working at effective ERM is the presence of a chief risk officer (CRO) or a dedicator manager who coordinates ERM efforts.\n\nThe COSO enterprise risk management framework identifies five core components that define how a company should approach creating its ERM practices.\n\nGovernance sets a company\u2019s tone, reinforcing the importance of ERM and establishing oversight responsibilities for it. Culture relates to a company\u2019s ethical values, desired behaviors, and understanding of risk. Principles of governance and culture are exercising board risk oversight; establishing operating structures; defining the desiredcompany culture; demonstrating a commitment to core values; and committing to building human capital (attracting, developing, and retaining capable individuals) that aligns with the strategy and business objectives.\n\nERM establishes and aligns a company\u2019s risk appetite with its strategy, while the company\u2019s business objectives put the strategy into practice and serve as a basis for identifying, assessing, and responding to risk. As the company determines its purpose, it must set objectives that support its mission and goals. These objectives must then be aligned with its risk appetite. The company\u2019sstrategic planscan be aligned with what it wants to accomplish, such as hiring additional regulatory staff for expansion areas it is unfamiliar with. It can also evaluate alternative strategies.\n\nRisks may affect the achievement of a company\u2019s strategy and business objectives, so ERM guidance dictates that they be identified and assessed. They are prioritized by severity as it relates to risk appetite. For example, high-risk events may pose risks to operations (e.g., natural disasters that force offices to temporarily close) or strategic (e.g.,government regulationoutlaws the company\u2019s primary product line). The company then identifies and selects risk responses and takes a portfolio view of the amount of assumed risk. The results are reported to key stakeholders.\n\nA company can consider how well ERM components are functioning over time by reviewing risk and performance. Substantial changes, if any need to be made, are identified and assessed; necessary revisions are identified; and ERM improvement is pursued.\n\nERM requires a company to continually obtain and share necessary information from internal and external sources. Information technology (IT) systems should be able to capture data useful to management to better understand the company\u2019s risk profile and risk management. This means not granting exceptions for departments outperforming others; all aspects of the company should be continually monitored. By extension, some of this data should beanalyzedand communicated to employees if it is relevant to mitigating risk. By communicating with employees, there is more likely to be greater buy-in for processes and protection over company assets.\n\nThe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) board originally published the ERM framework in 2004, then an updated version was published in 2017. The publication has been widely used since.\n\nERM practices will vary based on a company\u2019s size, risk preferences, and business objectives. Below are best practices that most companies can use to implement ERM strategies.\n\nAs a company implements ERM practices, it is widely advised to continually gather feedback from all employees. Everyone will have a different perspective of what might not be working or what could be done better.\n\nERM sets the organization-wide expectations around a company\u2019s culture. This includes communicating more openly about the risks a company faces and how to mitigate them. This leads to less unexpected risks and more guided direction on how to respond to certain events.\n\nIn addition, this may lead to greater employee satisfaction knowing plans are in place to protect company resources, as well as greater customer service knowing how to respond to customers should certain risks actually occur.\n\nERM practices are often synthesized by a standardized risk report delivered to upper management. This report succinctly summarizes the risks a company faces, the actions being taken, and the information needed for decision making. As a result, a company may be more efficient with its time, especially considering what is delivered to upper management.\n\nERM may also have a company-wide positive impact on the resourcefulness of the business. ERM may eliminate redundant processes, ensure efficient use of staff, reduce theft, or increaseprofitabilityby better understanding what markets to enter into.\n\nAs a company builds out its ERM practices, it will likely consider familiar risks it has been exposed to in the past. Therefore, ERM is limited in identifying future risks that the organization is unaware of that may have more detrimental impacts. In this manner, some may consider ERM as reactive, as companies can only forecast risk based on what they have prior experience with.\n\nERM also relies very heavily on management estimates and inputs. This may be nearly impossible to accurately predict. For example, in the very low chance that a company forecasts the occurrence of the COVID-19 pandemic, would a company be able to accurately calculate the fiscal impact of business closures or changes in consumer spending? ERM mitigation costs may also be difficult to assess.\n\nERM practices are time-intensive and therefore require the resources of the company to be successful. Though the company will benefit from protecting its assets, it must detract the time of its staff and may makecapital investmentsto implement ERM strategies. In addition, a company may find it difficult to quantify the success of ERM, as financial risks that do not occur must simply be projected.\n\nMay make a company more prepared for risks and uncertainties\n\nMay leave employees more satisfied with the future state of the company\n\nMay result in greater customer service, as companies are prepared for certain situations\n\nMay result in efficient reporting to upper management that enhances decision making\n\nMay lead to more efficient company-wide operations\n\nMay not accurately identify the risks a company is likely to experience\n\nMay not accurately assess the financial impact or likelihood of an outcome\n\nOften requires time investment from a company to be successful\n\nOften requires capital investment from a company to be successful\n\nERM can help devise plans for almost any type of business risk.Business riskthreatens a company\u2019s ability to survive, and these risks may be further classified into different risks discussed below. In general, ERM most commonly addresses the following types of risk:\n\nERM is particularly well-suited for large corporations operating in complex and diverse environments. These companies often face a bunch of risks across different business units, regions, and functions. ERM helps large corporations systematically identify, assess, and manage risks at both the operational and strategic levels.\n\nERM can also be specifically useful in certain industries. For example, ERM is great for financial institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and investment firms. These companies operate within highly regulated and volatile markets. These institutions face so many of the risks discussed above. By integrating ERM into their operations, financial institutions can strengthen risk management practices, optimize capital allocation, and enhance their resilience to economic downturns.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s worth calling out multinational corporations and global enterprises as ideal entities. These companies benefit from ERM because of their expansive operations across multiple countries and jurisdictions. These companies encounter diverse risks related to geopolitical instability, currency fluctuations,supply chaindisruptions, and regulatory compliance in varying regions. By implementing ERM frameworks, global enterprises can better track and maintain these risks, especially if their entity has higher risks in certain areas, departments, or business units.\n\nERM is primarily concerned with identifying, assessing, managing, and mitigating risks across an organization. On the other hand,enterprise resource planning (ERP)tools focus on integrating and optimizing core business processes. The primary purpose of ERP systems is to streamline operations across finance, manufacturing, sales, and marketing (among others). ERM addresses risks across various functions and departments within an organization. ERP systems are generally more specific in their scope. They tend to focus on more granular operational efficiencies instead of bigger-picture, comprehensive risks.\n\nImplementing ERM tools requires collaboration among key stakeholders like risk managers, compliance officers, executives, and board members. These stakeholders work together to establish risk management frameworks. ERP implementations may be more geared toward collaboration among IT teams, department heads, andend users. In addition to having a heavy part to play in operations, a primary component of ERP systems is the potentially live, interconnected play between data. For this reason, as opposed to an ERM tool, ERP systems may have a more technical demand to them.\n\nFinally, risk management strategies in ERM are designed to support long-term sustainability, protect organizational assets, and minimize potential disruptions. ERP systems align with an organization\u2019s strategic goals by improving productivity, reducing costs, and providing real-time insights into business operation opportunities. In a sense, ERM and ERP systems may counteract each other. For instance, an ERP system may signal growth and efficiency opportunities to expand in a specific new market; an ERM may signal that a new market is too great of a risk to consider.\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM)systems are centered around managing interactions with customers and prospects. It leverages technology and processes to organize, automate, and synchronize sales, marketing, customer service, and support activities. The primary aim of CRM is to improve relationships withcustomers, streamline business processes, and increase profitability by understanding and meeting customer needs effectively.\n\nLike an ERM, a CRM system consolidates data. However, the nature of the data is entirely different. While ERMs track and monitor risks, CRMs care most about customer data, interactions, and insights that enable the company to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction. CRM implementation is crucial for sales teams,marketingdepartments, customer service representatives, and executives who rely on customer data to drive sales growth and improve overall business performance. Alternatively, ERMs are more useful for operational teams like risk, insurance, operations, or finance.\n\nAn ERM focuses on comprehensive risk management across all facets of an organization. This tends to be inward-looking, though it can also incorporate external market forces. A CRM, alternatively, is much more outward-facing. While it will consider current processes and resources within a company, a CRM exists to monitor what is going on outside of the company with a company\u2019s arguably most important resource (i.e., its customers).\n\nExxonMobil (XOM) is a robust example of how ERM is implemented in a large multinational corporation operating in the oil and gas industry. ERM at ExxonMobil is a structured approach that spans all levels of the organization, aiming to identify, assess, manage, and mitigate risks that could impact its business operations and overall performance. Information on ExxonMobil\u2019s ERM strategy is on the company\u2019s website.\n\nExxonMobil\u2019s framework integrates five core elements: organizing and aggregating risks, rigorous risk identification practices, a prioritization method, systems and processes for risk management, and comprehensive risk governance. This multilayered approach includes defined roles and responsibilities for risk owners, functional experts, and independent verifiers. The goal is that each type of risk is actively managed and aligned with corporate requirements and processes.\n\nPrior to initiating new developments, the company employs advanced data and computer modeling to assess potential environmental, socioeconomic, and health risks associated with construction and operations. Engaging with communities through public meetings and collaborating with regulators ensures transparent communication and compliance with regulatory standards, both of which can minimize risks in the future.\n\nThis rigorous process guided by an integrated ERM also enables ExxonMobil to implement tailored measures to prevent, minimize, or mitigate environmental impacts. These different types of risks could range from changing weather patterns to sea level rise, seismic activity, or geological conditions. ExxonMobil\u2019s environmental assessments with its ERM are conducted for both offshore and onshore facilities to deploy protective measures effectively and uphold operational safety.\n\nERM is a company\u2019s approach to managing risk. It is the practices, policies, and framework for how a company handles a variety of risks that its business faces.\n\nERM is important because it helps prevent losses or unexpected negative outcomes. ERM is also important because it helps a company set the plans in place to strategically approach risk and garner employee buy-in.\n\nERM often summarizes the risks a company faces into operational, strategic, and financial risks. Operational risks impact day-to-day operations. Strategic risks impact long-term plans. Financial risks impact the general financial standing and health of a company.\n\nThe COSO framework for ERM identifies five components: governance and culture; strategy and objective setting; performance; review and revision; and information, communication, and reporting. These five core components drive a company\u2019s ERM practices.\n\nRisk management has traditionally been used to describe the practices and policies surrounding a specific risk that a company faces. More modern risk management has introduced ERM, a comprehensive, company-wide approach to view risk holistically for the entire company.\n\nAs a company makes, sells, and delivers goods to customers, it faces countless risks from numerous sources. To better plan for these risks, companies are turning to enterprise risk management (ERM), a company-wide, top-down approach to assessing risk and devising plans. The ultimate goal of ERM is to protect a company\u2019s assets and operations while having strategies in place should certain unfortunate events occur.\n\nNorth Carolina State University, Poole College of Management, Enterprise Risk Management Initiative. \u201cWhat Is Enterprise Risk Management (ERM)?\u201d\n\nCOSO. \u201cGuidance: Enterprise Risk Management.\u201d\n\nCOSO. \u201cEnterprise Risk Management: Integrating With Strategy and Performance.\u201d Pages 6, 7, 10.",
