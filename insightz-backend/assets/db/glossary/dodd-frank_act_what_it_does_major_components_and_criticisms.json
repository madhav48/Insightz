  "definition": "The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, commonly known as the Dodd-Frank Act or Dodd-Frank, is legislation that was passed by the U.S. Congress in response to financial industry behavior that led to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. It sought to make the U.S. financial system safer for consumers and taxpayers.\n\nNamed for sponsors Sen. Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.), the act contains numerous provisions, spelled out over 848 pages, that were to be implemented over a period of several years.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is a massive piece offinancial reform legislationthat was passed in 2010, during the Barack Obama presidential administration.\n\nIt established a number of new government agencies tasked with overseeing the various components of the law and, by extension, various aspects of thefinancial system.\n\nThe 2007\u20132008 financial crisis is perhaps the worst economic catastrophe to befall the country (and the world) since the Wall Street crash in 1929. Broadly speaking, it was caused by greed-driven behavior and lax oversight of financial institutions.\n\nThe loosening of financial industry regulations in the decades leading up to 2007 allowed various types of institutions in the U.S. financial services industry to lend money in ways that were riskier than ever before. The housing sector in particular experienced massive growth that couldn\u2019t be supported.\n\nThebubbleburst, sending the banking industry and global stock markets into a downfall. It created the worst globalrecessionin generations.\n\nDodd-Frank was created to keep anything similar from ever happening again.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was intended to prevent another financial crisis like the one in 2007\u20132008.\n\nHere are some of the law\u2019s key provisions and how they work:\n\nWhen Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, he pledged to repeal Dodd-Frank. Siding with critics, the U.S. Congress passed theEconomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which rolled back significant portions of the Dodd-Frank Act.\n\nIt was signed into law by then-President Trump on May 24, 2018.\n\nThese are some of the provisions of that law, and some of the areas in which previous standards were loosened:\n\nAfter Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, the CFPB focused on rescinding rules from the Trump era that were in direct conflict with the charter of the CFPB.\n\nThe Biden administration also announced its intent to reestablish rules against other forms of predatory lending, such aspayday loans. On June 30, 2023, Biden signed a law to overturn the payday lending regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC).Additionally,subprime auto loanpractices are being addressed by the CFPB.\n\nTrump returned to office in January 2025 and promised financial deregulation.On Feb. 1, 2025, he fired CFPB DirectorRohit Chopra.\n\nProponents of Dodd-Frank believed that the law would prevent the economy from experiencing a crisis like that of 2007\u20132008 and protect consumers from many of the abuses that contributed to the crisis.\n\nDetractors, however, have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, they contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions, despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis.\n\nSuch financial world notables as former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, Blackstone Group L.P. (BX) CEO Stephen Schwarzman, activist Carl Icahn, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints make for a moreilliquidmarket overall.\n\nThe lack of liquidity can be especially detrimental in the bond market, where all securities are notmarked to marketand manybondslack a constant supply of buyers and sellers. The higherreserverequirements under Dodd-Frank mean that banks must keep a higher percentage of their assets in cash. This decreases the amount that they are able to hold in marketable securities.\n\nIn effect, this limits the bond market-making role that banks have traditionally undertaken. With banks unable to play the part of amarket maker, prospective buyers are likely to have a harder time finding counteracting sellers. More importantly, prospective sellers may find it more difficult to find counteracting buyers.\n\nDodd-Frank was intended to curb the extremely risky financial industry activities that led to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008. Its goal was, and still is, to protect consumers and taxpayers from egregious practices like predatory lending.\n\nYes, it is; however, its regulatory strength was diluted with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act in 2018. Still, certain aspects, such as the bank stress tests it called for, are in use today. The Federal Reserve publishes stress test results regularly.\n\nDetractors of the Dodd-Frank Act have argued that the law could harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms relative to their foreign counterparts. In particular, critics contend that its regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions\u2014despite the fact that they played no role in causing the financial crisis. Several financial world notables have also argued that, while each institution is undoubtedly safer due to the capital constraints imposed by Dodd-Frank, the constraints also make for a more illiquid market overall.\n\nUnder the Dodd-Frank rules, banks with $50 billion inassetswere subject to more strenuous capital and liquidity requirements, but the new law passed in 2018 increased the asset threshold to $250 billion. This change relaxed the regulations for smaller and medium-sized banks. WhenSilicon Valley Bank collapsedin March 2023, observers argued that the lack of regulatory scrutiny on financial institutions of this size played a key role in the bank\u2019s failure.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in 2010, was a direct response to the financial crisis of 2007\u20132008 and the ensuing government bailouts under theTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).\n\nThis law established a wide range of reforms throughout the entire financial system, with the purpose of preventing a repeat of the 2007\u20132008 crisis and to prevent further government bailouts. The Dodd-Frank Act also included additional protections for consumers.\n\nAlthough the first Trump administration reversed and weakened several aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act, particularly those affecting consumers, the Biden administration sought to reestablish and strengthen the previous reversals to protect individuals who may be subject to predatory lending practices in industries such as for-profit education and automobiles. The second Trump administration may roll back the Biden administration\u2019s efforts.\n\nCongress.gov. \u201cH.R.4173\u2014Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: Text.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \u201cAbout FIO.\u201d\n\nThe White House, Obama Administration Archives. \u201cConsumer Financial Protection Bureau 101: Why We Need a Consumer Watchdog.\u201d\n\nU.S. Office of Financial Readiness. \u201cTruth in Lending Act: Consumer Protection for Borrowing Money.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service, via Federation of American Scientists, Project on Government Secrecy. \u201cThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: Background and Summary,\u201d Page 13 (Page 17 of PDF).\n\nFederal Reserve History. \u201cBanking Act of 1933 (Glass-Steagall).\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cAbout the Office of Credit Ratings.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cSection 922 (Whistleblower Protection) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,\u201d Pages 2, 6, and 8.\n\nCongress.gov. \u201cS.2155\u2014Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act: Summary.\u201d\n\nU.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. \u201cPresident Signs Van Hollen, Brown Legislation to Strike Down Trump-era \u2018Rent-a-Bank\u2019 Rule.\u201d\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \u201cCFPB and New York Attorney General Sue Credit Acceptance for Hiding Auto Loan Costs, Setting Borrowers Up to Fail.\u201d\n\nGlobal Finance Magazine. \u201cCan Trump Fulfill Promise on Bank Deregulation?\u201d\n\nNPR. \u201cTrump Fires Chief of the Federal Consumer Watchdog Agency.\u201d\n\nU.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, via GovInfo. \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u2019s Effects on Financial Services Competition,\u201d Pages 12\u201313 (Pages 16\u201317 of PDF).\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \u201cJamie Dimon Pushes for Simpler, More Coordinated Bank Regulations.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \u201cHow the Next Financial Crisis Will Happen.\u201d\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \u201cDodd-Frank Act Stress Test Publications.\u201d\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \u201cReview of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Supervision and Regulation of Silicon Valley Bank.\u201d",
