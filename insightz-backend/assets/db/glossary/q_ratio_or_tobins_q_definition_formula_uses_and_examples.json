  "definition": "The Q ratio, also known as Tobin's Q, measures the relationship betweenmarket valuationandintrinsic value. In other words, it estimates whether a business or market is\u00a0overvalued\u00a0orundervalued.\n\nThe Q ratio is calculated by dividing the market value of a company by its assets' replacement cost. Thus, equilibrium is when market value equals replacement cost.\n\nThe Q ratio is calculated as the market value of a company divided by the replacement value of the firm's assets. Since the replacement cost of total assets is difficult to estimate, another version of the formula is often used by analysts to estimate Tobin's Q ratio. It is as follows:\n\nOften, the assumption is made the market value of liabilities and the book value of a company's liabilities are equivalent, since market value typically does not account for a firm's liabilities. This provides a simplified version of the Tobin's Q ratio as the following:\n\nThe Tobin's Q ratio is a quotient popularized byJames Tobinof Yale University, Nobel laureate in economics, who hypothesized that the combinedmarket valueof all the companies on the stock market should be about equal to their replacement costs.\n\nWhile Tobin is often attributed as its creator, this ratio was first proposed in an academic publication by economist Nicholas Kaldor in 1966. In earlier texts, the ratio is sometimes referred to as \"Kaldor's v.\"\n\nA low Q ratio\u2014between 0 and 1\u2014means that the cost to replace a firm's assets is greater than the value of its stock. This implies that the stock is undervalued. Conversely, a high Q (greater than 1) implies that a firm's stock is more expensive than thereplacement costof its assets, which implies that the stock isovervalued.\n\nThis measure of stock valuation is the driving factor behind investment decisions in Tobin's Q ratio. When applied to the market as a whole, we can gauge whether an entire market is relatively overbought or undervalued; we can represent this relationship as follows:\n\nFor either a firm or a market, a ratio greater than one would theoretically indicate that the market or company is overvalued. A ratio that is less than one would imply that it is undervalued.\n\nUnderlying these simple equations is an equally simple intuition regarding the relationship between price and value. In essence, Tobin\u2019s Q Ratio asserts that a business (or a market) is worth what it costs to replace. The cost necessary to replace the business (or market) is itsreplacement value.\n\nIt might seem logical that fair market value would be a Q ratio of 1.0. But, that has not historically been the case.Prior to 1995 (for data as far back as 1945), the U.S. Q ratio never reached 1.0. During the first quarter of 2000, the Q ratio hit 2.15, while in the first quarter of 2009 it was 0.66. As of the second quarter of 2020, the Q ratio was 2.12.\n\nThe Q ratio for the entire U.S. stock market, as of March 31, 2024. In other words, the market value of all public companies is 73% greater than the replacement cost of all their assets.\n\nReplacement value (or replacement cost) refers to the cost of replacing an existing asset based on its current market price. For example, the replacement value of a one-terabyte hard drive might be just $50 today, even if we paid $500 for the same storage space a few years ago.\n\nIn this scenario, ascertaining the replacement value would be easy because there is a robust market for hard drives from which to examine prices. To determine what a one-terabyte hard drive is worth, we would simply need to determine what it would cost to buy a one-terabyte hard drive (of comparable quality and specifications) from one of the many different suppliers on the market. In many cases, however, the replacement value of assets can prove much more elusive than this.\n\nFor instance, consider a business that owns complicated software tailor-made for its operations. Because of its highly specialized nature, there may not be any comparable alternatives available on the market. Unlike our previous example, we could not simply check to see how much similar software is selling for, because sufficiently similar software would not exist. It would thus be difficult, if not impossible, to render an objective estimate of the software\u2019s replacement value.\n\nSimilar circumstances present themselves in a variety of business contexts, from complex industrial machinery and obscurefinancial assetsto intangible assets such asgoodwill. Due to the inherent difficulty of\u00a0determining the replacement value of these and similar assets, many investors do not regard Tobin\u2019s Q Ratio to be a reliable tool for valuing individual companies.\n\nThe formula for Tobin's Q ratio takes the total market value of the firm and divides it by the total asset value of the firm. For example, assume that a company has $35 million in assets. It also has 10 million shares outstanding that are trading for $4 a share. In this example, the Tobin's Q ratio would be:\n\nSince the ratio is greater than 1.0, the market value exceeds the replacement value and so we could say the firm is overvalued and might be a sale.\n\nAn undervalued company, one with a ratio of less than one, would be attractive to corporate raiders or potential purchasers, as they may want to purchase the firm instead of creating a similar company. This would likely result in increased interest in the company, which would increase its stock price, which in turn increase its Tobin's Q ratio.\n\nAs for overvalued companies, those with a ratio higher than one, they may see increased competition. A ratio higher than one indicates that a firm is earning a rate higher than its replacement cost, which would cause individuals or other companies to create similar types of businesses to capture some of the profits. This would lower the existing firm's market shares, reduce its market price and cause its Tobin's Q ratio to fall.\n\nTobin's Q is still used in practice, but others have since found thatfundamentalspredict investment results much better than the Q ratio, including the rate of profit\u2014either for a company or the average rate of profit for a nation's economy.\n\nOthers, like Doug Henwood in his bookWall Street: How It Works and For Whom, find that the Q ratio fails to accurately predict investment outcomes over an important time period.The data for Tobin's original (1977) paper covered the years 1960 to 1974, a period for which Q seemed to explain investment pretty well. But looking at other time periods, the Q fails to predict over- or undervalued markets or firms. While the Q and the investment seemed to move together for the first half of the 1970s, the Q collapsed during the bearish stock markets of the late 1970s, even as investment in assets rose.\n\nTobin's Q Ratio had a value of 1.730 as of March 31, 2024, when calculated for the entire U.S. stock market. In other words, the combined market capitalization of all public companies is 73% greater than the cost of replacing all of the assets of those companies.\n\nSome analysts believe that Tobin's Q ratio does not accurately forecast the value of an investment, at least compared with other analytical techniques like fundamental analysis. Moreover, many corporate assets are intangible, such as goodwill, brand recognition, and intellectual property. The difficulty of pricing these assets makes it difficult to calculate the Q ratio for those companies.\n\nWhen calculated for a single company, Tobin's Q ratio tells you whether the market value of a company is higher or lower than the company's replaceable assets. A high Q value may mean that the company is overvalued, and a low Q value means it may be undervalued.\n\nWhen calculated for the entire stock market, the Q ratio shows whether the aggregate market is relatively over- or under-valued.\n\nTobin's Q ratio measures the relationship between a company's market price and the cost of its assets. A high Q ratio means that a company's stock price is well above the value of its assets, and that company may be overvalued; a low Q ratio means that the company may be undervalued. When calculated for the market as a whole, the Q ratio may indicate that the market itself is overvalued or undervalued.\n\nMarket Business News. \"What Is Q Theory?
