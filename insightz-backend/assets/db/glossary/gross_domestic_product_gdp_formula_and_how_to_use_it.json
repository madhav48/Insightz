  "term": "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Formula and How to Use It",
  "definition": "Find out how GDP can help measure the health of a country\u2019s economy\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis releases Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures quarterly and annually.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) includes consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investments. It functions as a comprehensive scorecard of a country\u2019s economic health. GDP may be adjusted for inflation and population to provide deeper insights.Real GDPaccounts for inflation, whileNominal GDPdoes not.\n\nThe calculation of a country\u2019s GDP encompasses all private and public consumption, government outlays, investments, additions to private inventories, paid-in construction costs, and the foreignbalance of trade. Exports are added to the value, and imports are subtracted.\n\nOf all the components that make up a country\u2019s GDP, the foreign balance of trade is especially important. The GDP of a country tends to increase when the total value of goods and services that domestic producers sell to foreign countries exceeds the total value of foreign goods and services that domestic consumers buy. When this situation occurs, a country is said to have atrade surplus.\n\nIf the opposite situation occurs\u2014that is, if the amount that domestic consumers spend on foreign products is greater than the total sum of what domestic producers can sell to foreign consumers\u2014it is called atrade deficit. In this situation, the GDP of a country tends to decrease.\n\nGDP can be computed on a nominal basis or a real basis, the latter accounting forinflation. Overall, real GDP is a better method for expressing long-term national economic performance since it usesconstant dollars.\n\nLet\u2019s say one country had a nominal GDP of $100 billion in 2014. By 2024, its nominal GDP grew to $150 billion. Prices also rose by 100% over the same period. In this example, if you look solely at its nominal GDP, the country\u2019s economy appears to be performing well.\n\nHowever, the real GDP (expressed in 2014 dollars) would only be $75 billion, revealing that an overall decline in real economic performance actually occurred during this time.\n\nA country\u2019s GDP represents the final market value of all the products and services that a country produces in a single year. Another way to measure GDP is as the sum of four factors: consumer spending, government spending, net exports, and total investment.\n\nIn the United States, GDP is calculated every three months by theBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The BEA makes its estimate based on price estimates, survey data, and other information collected by other agencies, such as the Census Bureau, Federal Reserve, Department of the Treasury, and Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nGDP can be reported in several ways, each of which provides slightly different information.\n\nNominal GDP is an assessment of economic production in an economy that includes current prices in its calculation. In other words, it doesn\u2019t strip out inflation or the pace of rising prices, which can inflate the growth figure.\n\nAll goods and services counted in nominal GDP are valued at the prices at which those goods and services are sold for in that year. Nominal GDP\u00a0is evaluated in either the local currency or U.S. dollars at currency market exchange rates to compare countries\u2019 GDPs in purely financial terms.\n\nNominal GDP is used when comparing different quarters of output within the same year. When comparing the GDP of two or more years, real GDP is used. This is because, in effect, the removal of the influence of inflation allows the comparison of the different years to focus solely on volume.\n\nReal GDP is an inflation-adjusted measure that reflects the number of goods and services produced by an economy in a given year, with prices held constant from year to year to separate out the impact of inflation ordeflationfrom the trend in output over time. Since GDP is based on the monetary value of goods and services, it is subject to inflation.\n\nRising prices tend to increase a country\u2019s GDP, but this does not necessarily reflect any change in the quantity or quality of goods and services produced. Thus, by looking just at an economy\u2019s nominal GDP, it can be difficult to tell whether the figure has risen because of a real expansion in production or simply because prices rose.\n\nEconomists use a process that adjusts for inflation to arrive at an economy\u2019s real GDP. By adjusting the output in any given year for the price levels that prevailed in a reference year, called the base year,\u00a0economists can adjust for inflation\u2019s impact.\u00a0This way, it is possible to compare a country\u2019s GDP from one year to another and see if there is any real growth.\n\nReal GDP is calculated using aGDP price deflator, which is the difference in prices between the current year and the base year. For example, if prices rose by 5% since the base year, then the deflator would be 1.05. Nominal GDP is divided by this deflator, yielding real GDP. Nominal GDP is usually higher than real GDP because inflation is typically a positive number.\n\nReal GDP accounts for changes in market value and thus narrows the difference between output figures from year to year. If there is a large discrepancy between a nation\u2019s real GDP and nominal GDP, this may be an indicator of significant inflation or deflation in its economy.\n\nGDP per capita is a measurement of the GDP per person in a country\u2019s population. It indicates that the amount of output or income per person in an economy can indicate average productivity or average living standards.GDP per capitacan be stated in nominal, real (inflation-adjusted), orpurchasing power parity (PPP)terms.\n\nAt a basic interpretation, per-capita GDP shows how much economic production value can be attributed to each citizen. This also translates to a measure of overall national wealth since GDP market value per person also readily serves as a prosperity measure.\n\nPer-capita GDP is often analyzed alongside more traditional measures of GDP. Economists use this metric for insight into their own country\u2019s domestic productivity and the productivity of other countries. Per-capita GDP considers both a country\u2019s GDP and its population. Therefore, it can be important to understand how each factor contributes to the overall result and affects per-capita GDP growth.\n\nIf a country\u2019s per-capita GDP is growing with a stable population level, for example, it could be the result of technological progress that is producing more with the same population level. Some countries may have a high per-capita GDP but a small population, which usually means they have built up a self-sufficient economy based on an abundance of special resources.\n\nThe GDP growth rate compares the year-over-year (or quarterly) change in a country\u2019s economic output to measure how fast an economy is growing. Usually expressed as a percentage rate, this measure is popular for economic policymakers because GDP growth is thought to be closely connected to key policy targets such as inflation and unemployment rates.\n\nIf GDP growth rates accelerate, it may be a signal that theeconomyis overheating, and the central bank may seek to raise interest rates. Conversely,central bankssee a shrinking (or negative) GDP growth rate (i.e., a recession) as a signal that rates should be lowered and that stimulus may be necessary.\n\nWhile not directly a measure of GDP, economists look at PPP to see how one country\u2019s GDP measures up in international dollars using a method that adjusts for differences in local prices and costs of living to make cross-country comparisons of real output, real income, and living standards.\n\nThe annual rate of increase for U.S. GDP in the third quarter of 2024. U.S. GDP recorded a 3.0% increase during the second quarter of 2024.\n\nGDP can be determined via three primary methods. All three methods should yield the same figure when correctly calculated. These three approaches are often termed the expenditure approach, the output (or production) approach, and the income approach.\n\nThe expenditure approach, also known as the spending approach, calculates spending by the different groups that participate in the economy. The U.S. GDP is primarily measured based on the expenditure approach. This approach can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nGDP=C+G+I+NXwhere:C=ConsumptionG=Government\u00a0spendingI=InvestmentNX=Net\u00a0exports\\begin{aligned}&\\text{GDP} = \\text{C} + \\text{G} + \\text{I} + \\text{NX} \\\\&\\textbf{where:} \\\\&\\text{C} = \\text{Consumption} \\\\&\\text{G} = \\text{Government spending} \\\\&\\text{I} = \\text{Investment} \\\\&\\text{NX} = \\text{Net exports} \\\\\\end{aligned}\u200bGDP=C+G+I+NXwhere:C=ConsumptionG=Government\u00a0spendingI=InvestmentNX=Net\u00a0exports\u200b\n\nAll of these activities contribute to the GDP of a country. Consumption refers to private consumption expenditures or consumer spending. Consumers spend money to acquire goods and services, such as groceries and haircuts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP, accounting for more than two-thirds of the U.S. GDP.\n\nConsumer confidence, therefore, has a very significant bearing on economic growth. A high confidence level indicates that consumers are willing to spend, while a low confidence level reflects uncertainty about the future and an unwillingness to spend.\n\nGovernment spending represents government consumption expenditure and gross investment. Governments spend money on equipment, infrastructure, and payroll. Government spending may become more important relative to other components of a country\u2019s GDP when consumer spending and business investment both decline sharply. (This may occur in the wake of a recession, for example.)\n\nInvestment refers to private domestic investment or capital expenditures.Businesses spend money to invest in their business activities. For example, a business may buy machinery. Business investment is a critical component of GDP since it increases the productive capacity of an economy and boosts employment levels.\n\nThe net exports formula subtracts total exports from total imports (NX = Exports - Imports). The goods and services that an economy produces that are exported to other countries, less the imports that are purchased by domestic consumers, represent a country\u2019s net exports. All expenditures by companies located in a given country, even if they are foreign companies, are included in this calculation.\n\nThe production approach is essentially the reverse of the expenditure approach. Instead of measuring the input costs that contribute to economic activity, the production approach estimates the total value of economic output and deducts the cost ofintermediate goodsthat are consumed in the process (like those of materials and services). Whereas the expenditure approach projects forward from costs, the production approach looks backward from the vantage point of a state of completed economic activity.\n\nThe income approach represents a kind of middle ground between the two other approaches to calculating GDP. The income approach calculates the income earned by all thefactors of productionin an economy, including the wages paid to labor, the rent earned by land, the return on capital in the form of interest, and corporate profits.\n\nThe income approach factors in some adjustments for those items that are not considered payments made to factors of production. For one, there are some taxes, such as sales taxes and property taxes, that are classified as indirect business taxes.\n\nIn addition, depreciation, which is a reserve that businesses set aside to account for the replacement of equipment that tends to wear down with use, is also added to the national income. All of this together constitutes a nation\u2019s income.\n\nAlthough GDP is a widely used metric, there are other ways of measuring the economic growth of a country. While GDP measures the economic activity within the physical borders of\u00a0a country (whether the producers are native to that country or foreign-owned entities),gross national product (GNP)is a measurement of the overall production of people or corporations native to a country, including those based abroad. GNP excludes domestic production by foreigners.\n\nGross national income (GNI) is another measure of economic growth. It is the sum of all incomeearned by citizens or nationals of a country (regardless of whether the underlying economic activity takes place domestically or abroad).\n\nThe relationship between GNP andGNIis similar to the relationship between the production (output) approach and the income approach used to calculate GDP.\n\nGNP uses the production approach, while GNI uses the income approach. With GNI, the income of a country is calculated as its domestic income, plus its indirect business taxes and depreciation (as well as its net foreign factor income). The figure for net foreign factor income is calculated by subtracting all payments made to foreign companies and individuals from all payments made to domestic businesses.\n\nIn an increasingly global economy, GNI has been put forward as a potentially better metric for overall economic health than GDP. Because certain countries have most of their income withdrawn abroad by foreign corporations and individuals, their GDP figure is much higher than the figure that represents their GNI.\n\nFor example, Luxembourg has a significant difference between its GDP and GNI, mainly due to large payments made to the rest of the world via foreign corporations that do business in Luxembourg, attracted by the tiny nation\u2019s favorable tax laws.\n\nOn the contrary, GNI and GDP in the U.S. do not differ substantially. U.S. GDP was $29,37 trillion as of Q3 2024, while its GNI was about $27,57 trillion by the end of 2023 (latest available data).\n\nSeveral adjustments can be made to a country\u2019s GDP to improve the usefulness of this figure. For economists, a country\u2019s GDP reveals the size of the economy but provides little information about the standard of living in that country.\n\nPart of the reason for this is that population size and cost of living are not consistent around the world. Economists can usetax-to-GDPto get a better understanding of how a nation\u2019s tax revenue impacts its economy and its people.\n\nFor example, comparing the nominal GDP of China to the nominal GDP of Ireland would not provide much meaningful information about the realities of living in those countries because China has approximately 300 times the population of Ireland.\n\nTo help solve this problem, statisticians sometimes compare GDP per capita between countries. GDP per capita is calculated by dividing a country\u2019s total GDP by its population, and this figure is frequently cited to assess the nation\u2019s standard of living. Even so, the measure is still imperfect.\n\nSuppose China has a GDP per capita of $1,500, while Ireland has a GDP per capita of $15,000. This doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the average Irish person is 10 times better off than the average Chinese person. GDP per capita doesn\u2019t account for how expensive it is to live in a country.\n\nPPP attempts to solve this problem by comparing how many goods and services an exchange-rate-adjusted unit of money can purchase in different countries\u2014comparing the price of an item, or a basket of items, in two countries after adjusting for the exchange rate between the two, in effect.\n\nReal per-capita GDP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, is a heavily refined statistic to measure true income, which is an important element of well-being. An individual in Ireland might make $100,000 a year, while an individual in China might make $50,000 a year.\n\nIn nominal terms, the worker in Ireland is better off. But if a year\u2019s worth of food, clothing, and other items costs three times as much in Ireland as in China, then the worker in China has a higherreal income.\n\nMost nations release GDP data every month and quarter. In the U.S., the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) publishes an advance release of quarterly GDP four weeks after the quarter ends and a final release three months after the quarter ends. The BEA releases are exhaustive and contain a wealth of detail, enabling economists and investors to obtain information and insights on various aspects of the economy.\n\nGDP\u2019s market impact is generally limited since it is backward-looking, and a substantial amount of time has already elapsed between the quarter-end and GDP data release. However, GDP data can have an impact on markets if the actual numbers differ considerably from expectations.\n\nBecause GDP provides a direct indication of the health and growth of the economy, businesses can use GDP as a guide to their business strategy. Government entities, such as the Fed in the U.S., use the growth rate and other GDP stats as part of their decision process in determining what type of monetary policies to implement.\n\nIf the growth rate is slowing, they might implement anexpansionary monetary policyto try to boost the economy. If the growth rate is robust, they might use monetary policy to slow things down to try to ward off inflation.\n\nReal GDP is the indicator that says the most about the health of the economy. It is widely followed and discussed by economists, analysts, investors, and policymakers. The advance release of the latest data will almost always move markets, although that impact can be limited, as noted above.\n\nInvestors watch GDP since it provides a framework for decision-making. The corporate profits and inventory data in the GDP report are a great resource for equity investors, as both categories show total growth during the period; corporate profits data also displays pretax profits,operating cash flows, and breakdowns for all major sectors of the economy.\n\nComparing the GDP growth rates of different countries can play a part in asset allocation, aiding decisions about whether to invest in fast-growing economies abroad and, if so, which ones.\n\nOne interesting metric that investors can use to get a sense of the valuation of an equity market is the ratio of total market capitalization to GDP, expressed as a percentage. The closest equivalent to this in terms of stock valuation is a company\u2019s market cap to total sales (or revenues), which in per-share terms is the well-knownprice-to-sales ratio.\n\nJust as stocks in different sectors trade at widely divergent price-to-sales ratios, different nations trade at market-cap-to-GDP ratios that are all over the map. For example, according to The World Bank, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 156.5% for 2022 (latest information), while China had a ratio of 64.1% and Hong Kong had a ratio of 1,273.2%.\n\nHowever, the utility of this ratio lies in comparing it to historical norms for a particular nation. As an example, the U.S. had a market-cap-to-GDP ratio of 141.6% at the end of 2006, which dropped to 78.5% by the end of 2008 during the financial crisis.\n\nIn retrospect, these represented zones of substantial overvaluation and undervaluation, respectively, for U.S. equities.\n\nThe biggest downside of this data is its lack of timeliness; investors only get one update per quarter, and revisions can be large enough to significantly alter the percentage change in GDP.\n\nThe concept of GDP was first proposed in 1937 in a report to the U.S. Congress in response to the Great Depression, conceived of and presented by an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), Simon Kuznets.\n\nAt the time, the preeminent system of measurement was GNP. After theBretton Woodsconference in 1944, GDP was widely adopted as the standard means for measuring national economies; however, the U.S. continued to use GNP as its official measure of economic welfare until 1991, after which it switched to GDP.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, however, some economists and policymakers began to question GDP. Some observed, for example, a tendency to accept GDP as an absolute indicator of a nation\u2019s failure or success, despite its failure to account for health, happiness, inequality, and other constituent factors of public welfare. In other words, these critics drew attention to a distinction between economic progress and social progress.\n\nMost authorities, like Arthur Okun, an economist for President John F. Kennedy\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, held firm to the belief that GDP is an absolute indicator of economic success, claiming that for every increase in GDP, there would be a corresponding drop in unemployment.\n\nThere are, of course, drawbacks to using GDP as an indicator. In addition to the lack of timeliness, some criticisms of GDP as a measure are:\n\nThe World Bank hosts one of the most reliable web-based databases. It has one of the best and most comprehensive lists of countries for which it tracks GDP data. The International Money Fund (IMF) also provides GDP data through its multiple databases, such as the World Economic Outlook and International Financial Statistics.\n\nAnother highly reliable source of GDP data is theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD not only provides historical data but also forecasts GDP growth. The disadvantage of using the OECD database is that it tracks only OECD member countries and a few nonmember countries.\n\nIn the U.S., the Fed collects data from multiple sources, including a country\u2019s statistical agencies and the World Bank. The only drawback to using a Fed database is a lack of updating in GDP data and an absence of data for certain countries.\n\nThe BEA is a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce. It issues its analysis document with each GDP release, which is a great investor tool for analyzing figures and trends and reading highlights of the very lengthy full release.\n\nGross domestic product is a measurement that seeks to capture a country\u2019s economic output. Countries with larger GDPs will have a greater amount of goods and services generated within them, and will generally have a higher standard of living. For this reason, many citizens and political leaders see GDP growth as an important measure of national success, often referring to GDP growth and economic growth interchangeably. Due to various limitations, however, many economists have argued that GDP should not be used as a proxy for overall economic success, much less the success of a society.\n\nThe countries with the two highest GDPs in the world are the United States and China. However, their ranking differs depending on how you measure GDP. Using nominal GDP, the United States comes in first with a GDP of $27.72 trillion as of 2023, compared to $17.79 trillion in China.\n\nMany economists argue that it is more accurate to use purchasing power parity GDP as a measure of national wealth. By this metric, China is the world leader with a 2023 PPP GDP of $34.66 trillion, followed by $27.72 trillion in the United States.\n\nMost people perceive a higher GDP to be a good thing because it is associated with greater economic opportunities and an improved standard of material well-being. It is possible, however, for a country to have a high GDP and still be an unattractive place to live, so it is important to also consider other measurements.\n\nFor example, a country could have a high GDP and a low per-capita GDP, suggesting that significant wealth exists but is concentrated in the hands of very few people. One way to address this is to look at GDP alongside another measure of economic development, such as theHuman Development Index (HDI).\n\nIn their seminal textbook \u201cEconomics,\u201d\u00a0Paul Samuelson and William\u00a0Nordhaus neatly sum up the importance of the national accounts and GDP. They liken the ability of GDP to give an overall picture of the state of the economy to that of a satellite in space that can survey the weather across an entire continent.\n\nGDP enables policymakers and central banks to judge whether the economy is contracting or expanding, whether it needs a boost or restraint, and if a threat such as a recession or inflation looms on the horizon.\n\nLike any measure, GDP has its imperfections. In recent decades, governments have created various nuanced modifications in attempts to increase GDP accuracy and specificity. Means of calculating GDP have also evolved continually since its conception to keep up with evolving measurements of industry activity and the generation and consumption of new, emerging forms of intangible assets.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cWhat Is GDP?,\u201d Page 2.\n\nOpenStax, Rice University. \u201cPrinciples of Economics 3e: 19.2 Adjusting Nominal Values to Real Values.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cBEA in Brief: The Making of GDP.\u201d\n\nFocusEconomics. \u201cGDP per Capita (USD).\u201d\n\nIowa State University, Department of Economics. \u201cHow Is the GDP Growth Rate Measured?\u201d\n\nPressBooks. \u201cCore Principles of International Marketing: 5.2 Classifying World Economies.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cGross Domestic Product (Third Estimate), Corporate Profits (Revised Estimate), and GDP by Industry, Third Quarter 2024.\"\n\nHarvard Business School Online. \u201cWhat Is GDP & Why Is It Important?\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cShares of Gross Domestic Product: Personal Consumption Expenditures.\u201d\n\nStatistics Canada. \u201cGross Domestic Product by Production Approach.\u201d\n\nLibreTexts, Social Sciences. \u201cEconomics (Boundless): 19.1: Measuring Output Using GDP.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cGross Domestic Product as a Measure of U.S. Production.\u201d\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \u201cGross National Income.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGross National Income for Luxembourg.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cReal Gross Domestic Product for Luxembourg.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGross Domestic Product.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGross National Income for United States.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cPopulation, Total\u2014China, Ireland.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cGross Domestic Product.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cMarket Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (% of GDP)\u2014United States, Hong Kong SAR, China, China.\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Archival System for Economic Research (FRASER), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGDP: One of the Great Inventions of the 20th Century,\u201d Page 7 (Page 2 of PDF).\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cThe Changeover from GNP to GDP: A Milestone in BEA History.\u201d\n\nWorld Economic Forum. \u201cA Brief History of GDP\u2014And What Could Come Next.\u201d\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \u201cSpeech: Recent Developments in the Labor Market.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP (Current US$)\u2014Ireland.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGNI (Current US$)\u2014Ireland.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cWorld Economic Outlook.\u201d\n\nInternational Monetary Fund Data. \u201cInternational Financial Statistics.\u201d\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \u201cNominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\u201d\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cGross Domestic Product by Nation (Current U.S. Dollars).\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP (Current US$)\u2014United States, China.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP, PPP (Current International $)\u2014United States, China.\u201d\n\nPaul Samuelson and William Nordhaus, via Google Books. \u201cEconomics,\u201d Page 386.
