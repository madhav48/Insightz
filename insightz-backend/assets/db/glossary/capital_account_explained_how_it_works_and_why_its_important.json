  "definition": "Amanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nIn international macroeconomics, the capital account is part of the balance of payments, tracking the flow of capital in and out of a country. It records changes in ownership of assets, including foreign investments, loans, and the transfer of financial assets.\u00a0The capital account is important to track because it provides valuable insights into a country's economic health and interactions with the global economy.\n\nThe balance of payments consists of two primary components: thecurrent accountand the capital account.\u00a0Sometimes, the capital account is split into two sections: one is still called the capital account, and the other is called the financial account. The capital account covers specific types of asset transfers and non-financial assets, while the financial account deals with investments and financial transactions across borders.\n\nIn accounting, the capital account shows a business's net worth at a specific point in time. For asole proprietorship, it's known as owner's equity, and for acorporation, it's called shareholders' equity, reported in the bottom section of the balance sheet.\n\nChanges in the balance of payments can provide clues about a country\u2019s relative level of economic health and future stability. The capital account indicates whether a country is a net importer or exporter of capital. Big changes in the capital account can indicate how attractive a country is to foreign investors and can substantially impact exchange rates.\n\nBecause the balance of payments must always be balanced, countries that run largetrade deficits(current account deficits), like the United States, must, by definition, also run large capital account surpluses. This means more capital flows into the country than goes out, caused by increased foreign ownership of domestic assets.\n\nA country with a largetrade surplusexports capital and runs a capital account deficit, meaning money flows out of the country in exchange for increased ownership of foreign assets. For example, China's merchandise trade surplus had reached an all-time high of nearly $890 billion in 2022.\n\nIt's important to remember that the U.S. trade deficit results from foreign investors finding U.S. assets particularly attractive and driving up the dollar's value. Should America's relative appeal to foreign investors fade, the dollar would weaken, and the trade deficit would shrink.\n\nIn recent years, many countries have adopted the narrower definition of capital account used by theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF). This definition splits the capital account into two top-level divisions: the financial account and thecapital account. The capital and financial accounts measure net flows of financial claims (i.e., changes in a country\u2019s asset and liability positions).\n\nAn economy's stock of foreign assets versus foreign liabilities is referred to as itsnet international investment position, or simplynet foreign assets. This metric indicates a country's net claims on the rest of the world. If a country\u2019s claims on the rest of the world exceed the claims against it, it has positive net foreign assets and is considered a net creditor. If negative, it is a net debtor. Changes in this position over time are reflected in the capital and financial accounts.\n\nThe financial account measures changes in international ownership of assets, whether individuals, businesses, governments, or central banks hold the assets. These assets includeforeign direct investments, securities like stocks and bonds, and gold and foreign exchange reserves. The capital account, under this definition, covers financial transactions that don't affect income, production, or savings, such as the transfer of drilling rights, trademarks, copyrights, and other intangible assets.\n\nThe current and capital accounts represent two halves of a nation's balance of payments. The\u00a0current account\u00a0represents a country's net income over some time, while the\u00a0capital account\u00a0records thenet change of assets and liabilitiesduring a particular year.\n\nIn economic terms, the current account deals with cash receipts, payments, and non-capital items, while the capital account reflects sources and utilization of capital. The sum of the current and capital accounts reflected in the balance of payments will always be zero, meaning that an equal and opposite surplus or deficit in the capital and financial accounts combined offsets any surplus or deficit in the current account.\n\nThe balance of the U.S. capital account as of Q1 2024. This figure is calculated by subtracting capital transfer payments and other debits from capital transfer receipts and other credits. The negative number means the U.S. experienced a net capital outflow this quarter.\n\nThe current account deals with a country's short-term transactions or the difference between its savings and investments. These are also referred to as actual transactions (as they have a real impact on income), output, and employment levels through the movement of goods and services in the economy.\n\nThe current account consists\u00a0of visible trade (export and import of goods),invisible trade(export and import of services), unilateral transfers, and\u00a0investment income\u00a0(income from factors such as land or foreign shares).\n\nThe credit and debit of\u00a0foreign exchange\u00a0from these transactions are also recorded in thebalance of the current account. The resulting balance of the current account is approximated as the total of\u00a0the balance of trade.\n\nIn accounting, a capital account is a general ledger account that is used to record the owners'contributed capitaland retained earnings\u2014the cumulative amount of a company's earnings since it was formed minus the cumulative dividends paid to the shareholders. This account is part of the equity section at the bottom of the company\u2019s balance sheet.\n\nIn a sole proprietorship, this section is referred to as \"owner's equity,\" while in a corporation, it's known as \"shareholder's equity.\" The equity section in a corporate balance sheet typically includes common stock, preferred stock,additional paid-in capital(APIC), retained earnings, and treasury stock accounts. All of the accounts have a natural credit balance except for treasury stock, which has a natural debit balance. Common and preferred stock are recorded at the par value of total shares owned by shareholders.\n\nAdditional paid-in capital is the amount shareholders have paid into the company in excess of the stock's par value. Retained earnings are the cumulative earnings of the company over time, minus dividends paid out to shareholders, that have been reinvested in the company's ongoing business operations. The treasury stock account is acontra equity accountthat records a company's share buybacks.\n\nA capital account in accounting refers to the financial assets that a company is able to spend in a given period. An equity account is the portion that shareholders would receive in a liquidation event\u2014when a company's assets are sold and its debts are paid off.\n\nA capital account is important because it shows the flow of investment (both public and private)in and out of a country. If more investment flows out of a country, the capital account is in deficit; if more flows in, it's a surplus. Ideally, a country would prefer a surplus, as it shows strong global demand for a country's goods and services, which is better for its economy.\n\nItaly currently has the largest capital account, with a surplus of $17.22 billion.\u00a0The countries following Italy are Spain, France, Romania, and the Czech Republic.\n\nThe balance of payments, which records all of a country's transactions with other countries in a specific period, consists of thecapital account and the current account. The capital account looks at the net changes in assets and liabilities, while the financial account records cross-border investments and financial flows.\n\nA capital account surplus means more money is coming into the country from foreign investors, while a deficit means that domestic investors are putting more money into foreign assets. In the balance of payments, when one account has a surplus, the other usually has a deficit, keeping the overall balance even. These figures help economists understand a nation's economic health and global standing.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota Twin Cities. \"15.2 International Finance.\" See \"Equation 15.3.\"\n\nSt. Louis Fed, FRED. \"Balance on Capital Account.\"\n\nIntereconomics. \"China\u2019s Trade Surplus \u2013 Implications for the World and for Europe.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"What Is the Capital Account in the Balance of Payments Statistics (BOPS)?\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"What Is the Financial Account in the Balance of Payments Statistics (BOPS)?\"\n\nKnoema. \"Net Capital Account in Current Prices.\"",
