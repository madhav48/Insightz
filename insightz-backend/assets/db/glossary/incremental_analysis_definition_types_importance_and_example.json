  "definition": "Incremental analysis is a problem-solving method to compare the cost differences between different business options.\n\nIncremental analysis is a decision-making tool used in business to find the most profitable choice among alternative opportunities. Also calledmarginal analysis, the relevant cost approach, or differential analysis, incremental analysis disregards any sunk cost (past cost) to focus on ongoing expenses and opportunity costs.\n\nIncremental analysis is useful when a company works on its business strategies, including the decision to self-produce or outsource a process, job, or function.\n\nIncremental analysis is a problem-solving method that applies accounting information\u2014with a focus on costs\u2014to strategic decision-making.\n\nThe use of incremental analysis can help businesses identify the potential financial outcomes of one business action or opportunity compared to another. With that information, management can make better-informed decisions that can affect profitability.\n\nRelevant costs (also called incremental costs) are incurred only when a particular activity has been initiated or increased.\n\nNon-relevant,sunk costsare expenses that already have been incurred. Because the sunk costs are present regardless of any opportunity or related decision, they are not included in incremental analysis.\n\nIncremental analysis models include only relevant costs, and typically these costs are broken into variable costs and fixed costs.\n\nIncremental analysis also considersopportunity costs\u2014the financial implications of a missed\u00a0opportunity when choosing one alternative over another\u2014to ensure that a company is aware of and can pursue its most favorable option.\n\nCompanies use incremental analysis to decide whether to accept additional business, make or buy products, sell or process products further, eliminate a product or service, and decide how to allocate resources.\n\nThe Acme company sells a particular item for $300. The company pays $125 for labor, $50 for materials, and $25 for variable overhead selling expenses. The company also allocates $50 per item for fixedoverhead costs.\n\nThe company is not operating at capacity and will not be required to invest in equipment or overtime to accept any special order that it may receive. Then, a special order arrives requesting the purchase of 15 items at $225 each.\n\nThe sum of all variable costs and fixed costs per item is $250. However, the $50 of allocated fixed overhead costs are a sunk cost and are already spent. The company has excess capacity and should only consider the relevant costs. Therefore, the cost to produce the special order is $200 per item ($125 + $50 + $25). The profit per item would be $25 ($225 - $200).\n\nWhile the company is able to make a profit on this special order, the company must consider the ramifications of operating at full capacity.\n\nIf no excess capacity is present, additional expenses to consider include investment in new fixed assets, overtime labor costs, and the opportunity cost of lost sales.\n\nIncremental analysis only focuses on the differences between particular courses of action. These differences\u2014not the similarities\u2014form the basis of the analysis comparison.\n\nA primary benefit of its examination of costs is that it can help a business make the best use of available resources and maintain a focus on profitability.\n\nIt examines relevant costs and opportunity costs. It also takes into account sunk, or non-relevant costs, and excludes those from analysis.\n\nOne aspect that companies must be aware of is the potential for cost assumptions to be wrong. Every effort must be made to make correct cost estimates so that the choice of an opportunity that a business ultimately makes doesn't affect the company negatively.\n\nIncremental analysis is a crucial decision-making tool that can help businesses better understand their costs, utilize resources efficiently, and maximize profit.\n\nIts focus on true costs, including opportunity costs, and its stripping away of irrelevant information, can reveal in a less effort-intensive amount of time the most cost-effective options for companies to choose from to reach important financial goals.",
