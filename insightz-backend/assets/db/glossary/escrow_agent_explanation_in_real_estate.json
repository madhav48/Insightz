  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nAn escrow agent is a person or entity that holds property in trust for third parties while atransactionis finalized or a disagreement is resolved. The role of escrow agent is often played by an attorney (or notary in civil law jurisdictions). The escrow agent has afiduciaryresponsibility to both parties of theescrow agreement.\n\nAn escrow agent essentially serves as a neutral middleman in the context of an escrow agreement. An escrow agreement is a contract between two parties whereby each agrees that a third party should hold an asset on their behalf until their transaction is completed. The funds or assets are held by the escrow agent until it receives the appropriate instructions or until predetermined contractual obligations have been fulfilled. Money, securities, funds, and titles to real estate can all be heldin escrow.\n\nThere are similarities between the role of atrusteeand the role of an escrow agent, but there are significant differences as well. The two roles are similar in that in each case a third party holds property \"in trust\" for someone else and has a fiduciary duty. However, a trustee has a duty toward\u00a0the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) of the trust and must act in their best interest. In contrast, an escrow agent's duty is toward\u00a0both parties of\u00a0a transaction, and they are tightly bound by the terms of the escrow agreement.\n\nEscrow agents are typically associated with selling or buying a home or other real estate. In some jurisdictions, including the United States, they may be referred to as title agents. In these cases, the escrow agent secures the property and examines documents to make sure the terms of the sale are met on each end, thus\u00a0serving both the buyer and seller in the transaction.\n\nWhen it comes to buying and selling a home, an escrow agent may be a title company. In such cases, the title company holds the deed to the property in escrow until all of the terms of both the buyer and seller are met. The buyer may deposit the money for the purchase, or at least the down payment, with the escrow agent, which serves to validate the transaction and reassure the seller until last-minute closing terms are met. The amount in escrow is then transferred to the seller, and the property deed to the buyer, once all the conditions for the sale are satisfied.\n\nIn summary, whether the escrow agent is a business or an individual, the purpose they serve is that of a neutral, trustedthird partyto transactions that may involve persons who never end up meeting each other.",
