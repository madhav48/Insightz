  "term": "What Is a Third Party? How Their Role Works and Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA third party is an individual or entity that is involved in a transaction but is not one of the principals and, thus, may have a lesser interest in the transaction. An example of a third party would be theescrowcompany in a real estate transaction; the escrow party acts as a neutral agent by collecting the documents and money that the buyer and seller exchange when completing the transaction.\n\nA collection agency may be another example of a third party. If a debtor owes a creditor a sum of money and hasn't been making the scheduled payments, the creditor is likely to hire acollection agencyto ensure that the debtor honors his agreement.\n\nA third party may also refer to an entity that a company uses to mitigate risk. For example, small investment firms face difficulty entering the industry when large firms continue leading the competition. One reason large firms grow more quickly is because they invest in middle- andback-officeinfrastructure. To stay competitive, many smaller firmsoutsourcethose functions as a method of gaining a greater share of the marketplace.\n\nSmall firms save time and money by leveraging scalable infrastructure with variable costs for trade operations, data storage, disaster recovery, and system integration and maintenance. By outsourcing middle- and back-office solutions, small firms take advantage of technology and processes for more efficient task completion, maximumoperating efficiency, reduced operational risks, decreased reliance on manual processes, and minimal errors. Operational costs are reduced, compliance is enhanced, and tax and investor reporting improve.\n\nAreal estate escrow company acts as a third partyto hold deeds, documents, and funds involved in completing real estate transactions. The company deposits the funds in an account on behalf of the buyer and the seller. The escrow officer follows the directions of the lender, the buyer, and the seller in an efficient manner when handling the funds and documentation involved in the sale. For example, the officer pays authorized bills and responds to the principals\u2019 authorized requests.\n\nAlthough the escrow process follows a similar pattern for all homebuyers, the details differ among properties and specific transactions. The officer follows instructions when processing the escrow and, upon meeting all written requirements, delivers the documents and the funds to the appropriate parties before closing the escrow.\n\nA company may hire acollection agencyfor securing payment of company debt. Company invoices or initial customer contracts typically state at which time a collection agency may be used for securing outstanding payments. Some businesses can carry debt for years, whereas others expect payment within 90 days. The schedule depends on the market and the company\u2019s relationship with the client.\n\nWhen a business would pay more in court fees than the amount of the debt itself, the business may utilize a collection agency\u2019s services instead of filing a lawsuit. The agency may pay the business 10% or less for each outstanding invoice, or it may agree to a large percentage of commission for recovered debts. The agency consolidates the company\u2019s debt and goes to work recovering the outstanding balances.",
