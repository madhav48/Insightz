  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA noncancellable insurance policy is a disability insurance policy that can't be canceled, have its benefits reduced, or its premiums increased by the insurance company during the life of the policy. You pay more for this type of coverage, but then your coverage and costs are predictable. Here's how a noncancellable policy compares against other options for disability insurance.\n\nWhen you apply for disability insurance, the cost depends on your age, health, and risk of disability from your work. This coverage can last many years and possibly your entire career. You pick how long you want the coverage to last. For example, you may want it to last until you turn 65. When applying, you decide what ability the insurance company has to adjust your coverage and premium cost.\n\nIf you choose a noncancellable insurance policy, the insurance company agrees that it will not increase your premiums, change your benefits, or cancel your coverage over the life of the policy. It doesn't matter if you develop health problems later or if your disability risk increases as you get older. The coverage and costs stay the same throughout your policy.\n\nDisability insurance could also beguaranteed renewable. If you buy a policy that is only guaranteed renewable, the insurer must let you keep your policy as long as you pay yourpremiums. However, your premiums could go up as you get older. The insurer is allowed to raise the premiums on a guaranteed renewable policy as long as the increase affects numerous policyholders and not just a particular customer.For example, the insurer could increase premiums on everyone with your job or who is your age. It couldn't increase your premiums because you, as an individual, get sick or hurt.\n\nAvoid purchasing aconditionally-renewablepolicy. Also known as optionally renewable, this allows the insurance company to raise your premiums or cancel your coverage if the insurer thinks the risk of insuring you has risen. These policies put you at risk of losing coverage when you need it most and at a time when you may be unable to qualify for a new policy. The insurer can change premiums and other policy conditions annually, so this option provides the least beneficial arrangement for the insured.\n\nNoncancellable disability insurance provides the most stability. However, these policies charge a higher upfront premium than the other options.\n\nAnother benefit of a noncancellabledisability insurancepolicy is that if your income decreases, your coverage will stay the same. If you were laid off from your office job and had to take up other work for less pay, for example, you would still be able to keep your insurance with a noncancellable policy.\n\nMost\u00a0people don't have any guarantee that their income will never go down.Under a noncancellable insurance\u00a0policy,\u00a0even if someone's\u00a0income decreases in the future\u2013such as when they\u00a0are totally disabled\u2013the company will pay\u00a0the total benefit\u00a0from the original contract. Under a noncancellable policy, even if someone\u00a0changes\u00a0jobs from a low-risk, white-collar occupation to a riskier one such as a professional race car driver, the company cannot decrease the insured's\u00a0benefits.\n\nDisability insurance usually has an expiration date. This applies even to noncancellable and guaranteed renewable policies. Many policies only cover until you turn 65 or 67.At this point, the coverage either ends or you would need to pay a much higher premium to maintain disability insurance. The noncancellable feature only locks in your premium until you reach this age and then costs can go up.\n\nBy age 65, many people no longer need life or disability insurance. Those who are retired or near retirement, and who have saved their money for many years will no longer need the financial protection that these products provide.\n\nA guaranteed renewable policy allows the insurer to change your future premiums. If you choose non-cancellable and guaranteed renewable coverage together,you are in controlof any future changes. You don't have to worry about a price increase.\n\nA noncancellable policy prevents your insurance premiums from going up. These policies also offer protection when income changes. Under a noncancellable policy,\u00a0even if your income declines in the future, the company must pay\u00a0the original disability benefit\u00a0amount. With disability insurance, if you take up another job for lesser pay, you would still be able to keep your insurance with a noncancellable policy and draw the original benefit as needed.\n\nConditionally-renewable policies allow the insurer to raise your premiums, modify benefits, or cancel your coverage if the company decides the risk of insuring you has become too high. This can put you at risk of losing coverage when you cannot afford to give it up, such as right after a serious injury or illness.\n\nNoncancellable insurance gives the policyholder peace of mind that the policy's cost, amount of coverage, and term are known. Future premium changes are also typically known when the policy is issued. You can rest assured that you won\u2019t have to re-qualify for the policy at some point in the future when your\u00a0health might not be as sound and insurance might be harder to get.\n\nDisability Insurance Quotes. \"Non-Cancellable and Guaranteed Renewable Disability Insurance.\"\n\nJournal of the American Medical Association.\"The Association Between Income and Life Expectancy in the United States, 2001\u20132014.\"\n\nNew York Life. \"Individual Disability Insurance.\"",
