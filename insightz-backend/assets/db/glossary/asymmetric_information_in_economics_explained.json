  "term": "Asymmetric Information in Economics Explained",
  "definition": "Asymmetric information occurs when one party to an economic transaction possesses greater material knowledge than the other party.\n\nThis typically manifests when the seller of agood or servicepossesses greater knowledge than the buyer. However, the reverse dynamic is also possible. Also known as \"information failure,\" asymmetric information is involved in nearly all economic transactions.\n\nAsymmetric information exists in certain deals whereby one party has more or better information than the other. This is usually the case in the sale of an item. For example, if a homeowner wanted to sell their house, they would have more information about the house than the buyer. They might know some floorboards are creaky, the home gets too cold in winter, or that the neighbors are too loud\u2014information that the buyer would not know until after they purchased the house. The buyer, then, might feel they paid too much for the house or would not have purchased it at all if they had this information beforehand.\n\nAsymmetric information can also be viewed as the specialization and division of knowledge, as applied to any economic trade. For example, doctors typically know more about medical practices than their patients.\u00a0After all, physicians have extensive medical school educational backgrounds that their patients generally don't have. This principle equally applies to architects,teachers, police officers, attorneys,engineers, fitness instructors, and other trained professionals. Asymmetric information, therefore, can be beneficial to an economy and a society in increasing efficiency.\n\nAsymmetric information isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, growing asymmetrical information is the desired outcome of a healthymarket economy. As workers strive to become increasingly specialized in their chosen fields, they become more productive, and can consequently provide greater value to workers in other fields.\n\nFor example, a stockbroker's knowledge is more valuable to a non-investment professional, such as a farmer, who may be interested in confidently trading stocks to prepare forretirement. On the flip side, thestockbrokerdoes not need to know how to grow crops or tend to livestock to feed themself, but rather can purchase the items from a grocery store that are provided by the farmer.\n\nIn each of their respective trades, both the farmer and the stockbroker hold superior knowledge over the other, but both benefit from the trade and the division of labor.\n\nOne alternative to ever-expanding asymmetric information is for workers to study all fields, rather than specialize in fields where they can provide the most value. However, this is an impractical solution, with highopportunity costsand potentially lower aggregate outputs, which would lower standards of living.\n\nIn some circumstances, asymmetric information may have nearly fraudulent consequences, such asadverse selection, which describes a phenomenon where an insurance company encounters the probability of extreme loss due to a risk that was not divulged at the time of a policy's sale.\n\nIn certain asymmetric information models, one party can retaliate for contract breaches, while the other party cannot.\n\nFor example, if the insured hides the fact that they're a heavy smoker and frequently engage in dangerous recreational activities, this asymmetrical flow of informationconstitutes adverse selectionand could raiseinsurance premiumsfor all customers, forcing the healthy to withdraw. The solution is for life insurance providers to perform thoroughactuarialwork and conduct detailed health screenings, and then charge different premiums to customers based on their honestly disclosed risk profiles.\n\nTo prevent abuse of customersor clients by finance specialists, financial markets often rely on reputation mechanisms. Financial advisors and fund companies that prove to be the most honest and effective stewards of their client's assets tend to gain clients, while dishonest or ineffective agents tend to lose clients, face legal damages, or both.\n\nTwo common problems can arise from asymmetric information:moral hazardand adverse selection.\n\nMoral hazard refers to situations in which one party's actions or behaviors change following a transaction. For instance, a homeowner who buys flood insurance and afterward ceases to take proactive measures to mitigate flood damage.\n\nAdverse selection occurs when one party to a transaction seeks to benefit from asymmetric information. For instance, an individual who smokes might not disclose that information when applying for health insurance. This would obscure to the insurer the full potential risk of covering the individual.\n\nAsymmetric information can lead to market failures. This is due to the fact that prices in markets are supposed to respond to demand and supply. When there is asymmetric information, buyers and sellers alike may distort pricing by withholding critical information about a product's quality or risk. This can then lead to economic outcomes that are unfair or inefficient allocations of resources.\n\nIn the context of markets, thelemonrepresents a problematic product whose true value is difficult to assess due to asymmetric information.\n\nAsymmetric information occurs in an economic transaction when one party has more knowledge than the other. This commonly occurs in commerce, where a seller has more information about product quality than a buyer.\n\nAsymmetric information isn't always a disadvantage, as it can represent specialization of the workforce. However, it can also give rise to situations where one party takes advantage over another.",
