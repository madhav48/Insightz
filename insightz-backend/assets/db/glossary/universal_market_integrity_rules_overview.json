  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nUniversal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR) are a\u00a0set of rules governing trading practices in Canada. These rules are set out by an independent regulator, theInvestment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada(IIROC).\u00a0UMIR were established to promote fair, equitable, and efficient markets. Prior to the formation of the UMIR, each individual exchange was responsible for governing its trading practices. By making these practices universal, Canadian exchanges ensure equal fairness and improve investor confidence in all the exchanges.\n\nThe IIROC\u00a0determines the UMIR. The IIROC is a\u00a0national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers and trade\u00a0on debt and equity marketplaces in Canada. The IIROC\u00a0writes rules that set high regulatory and investment industry standards such as UMIR, screens all investment advisors employed by IIROC-regulated firms, reviews firms' financial compliance, and sets minimum capital requirements so that firms have sufficient\u00a0capital for business operations. This oversight reduces the number of bankruptcies from excessive leverage and risky business practices.\n\nThe IIROC\u00a0conducts compliance reviews to check that firms\u00a0properly supervise the handling of client accounts and that advice and transactions appropriately reflect the client\u2019s needs and instructions. IIROC-approved advisors must follow suitability and \u201cknow your client\u201d rules by being familiar with a client\u2019s financial situation, investment needs, objectives, investing experience, and tolerance for risk. The IIROC\u00a0conducts trading conduct compliance reviews to check trading firms' trade-desk procedures. The reviews assess whether trade-desk procedures comply with (UMIR) and applicable provincial securities law.\n\nThe IIROC\u00a0surveys the market and analyzes trading to ensure that trading complies with UMIR and applicable provincial securities law.\u00a0The IIROC\u00a0is responsible for identifying misconduct by dealers or firms, approved persons, and other market participants and bringing\u00a0disciplinary proceedings such as fines, suspensions, and permanent bans or terminations for individuals and firms. The money raised from\u00a0fines and settlements is added to IIROC\u2019s restricted fund and applied to capital expenditures for regulatory issues,\u00a0investor and industry education projects, and other uses authorized under IIROC\u2019s Recognition Orders.\n\nAccording to the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), traders\u00a0who are members\u00a0with a good track record with IIROC and who are also registered with a Canadian securities regulatory authority can apply to gain access to trade on the CSE.\n\nThe IIROC amends UMIR\u00a0rules from time to time. For example, in 2015 the IIROC\u00a0proposed amendments to the rules after a proposal byCanada Securities Administrator(CSA) to clarify the interpretation of a protected order. The\u00a0CSA proposed that\u00a0orders\u00a0that implement\u00a0a systematic order processing delay, or a \u201cspeed bump,\u201d\u00a0would not be considered protected orders.\n\nCanadian Securities Exchange. \"Trading Rules and Regulations.\"\n\nInvestment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada. \"Proposed Amendments Respecting Unprotected Transparent Marketplaces and the Order Protection Rule,\" Page 1.",
