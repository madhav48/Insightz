  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nDavid is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA holographicwillis a handwritten and testator-signed document and is an alternative to a will produced by a lawyer. Some states do not recognize holographic wills. States that do permit holographic wills require the document meet specific requirements to be valid. The minimal requirements for most states are proof that thetestatorwrote the will, and evidence that the testator had the mental capacity to write the will.\n\nHolographic wills do not need to be witnessed or notarized, which can lead to some issues during will validation in probate court. To avoid fraud, the testator must sign the will, and the court will determine whether the will and signature were by the testator's hand.\n\nHandwriting experts or people familiar with the decedent's handwriting must convince the court that the signature was indeed that of the deceased. Problems arise when the handwriting is vague or illegible.\n\nAs with anywill, a testator to a holographic will must be explicit as to named beneficiaries and the receipt of property or assets, such as stocks, bonds, and fund accounts. The testator may also detail circumstances for recipients to meet to receive named assets.\n\nHolographic wills are not accepted in all states and are subject to each state's laws.\n\nSome lawyers recommend that explaining why specific property or other assets such assecuritieswould be left to which beneficiaries would indicate that the testator was of sound mind. Being of sound mind is a crucial provision in determining the validity of a holographic will.\n\nAlso, a holographic will argued in probate court may not contain the testator's final wishes. The decedent may have written the holographic will as a draft or may have utterly forgotten to update it. These questions may be brought up in court.\n\nToday, there are a variety of software, books, and websites with detailed instructions on how to create and print a valid will and avoid some probate court problems. If a will is printed as opposed to being handwritten, it requires the witness of at least two people.\n\nIt's important to note that state probate law ultimately decides the treatment of all wills within its borders. Some states will accept holographic wills to varying degrees. These states include; Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.\n\nIn some states, holographic wills made within the state are not recognized, but such wills that are made within jurisdictions where holographic wills are recognized are accepted under foreign wills provisions. In order for a holographic will to be recognized as valid under a foreign wills provision where this practice is legal, the holographic will must have been made in a jurisdiction that recognizes holographic wills. States with foreign wills or foreign testament provisions are Alabama, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nIn New York and Maryland, holographic wills are only recognized if they are made by a member of the Armed Forces. In Maryland, these wills remain valid only for one year after the testator leaves the Armed Forces unless they are no longer of sound mind under the law at that time.In New York, such a will is valid for one year after the testator is discharged from the Armed Forces, or for one year after they regain a testamentary capacity, whichever happens last.\n\nUniform Law Commission. \u201cUniform Probate Code.\u201d Pages 113-115.
