  "term": "How Efficiency Is Measured",
  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nEfficiency levels are calculated by dividing total output by total input.\n\nEfficiency means that an entity is operating at an optimum level of performance. It is a measurable concept that can be determined by the ratio of useful output to total input. A company that maximizes efficiency effectively employs resources such as raw materials, labor hours, energy, and time.\n\nTo be efficient, individuals and entities achieve results by optimizing the use of scarce resources. This may include money,human capital, production equipment, and energy sources. Analyzing efficiency can help reduce costs and increase a company's bottom line.\n\nCorporations can measure the efficiency of a production process, which can reduce costs while increasing output, leading to higher sales andrevenue. For example,artificial intelligence (AI)can enhance supply chain management. AI helps companies forecast demand more accurately and plan accurate inventory levels.Data analytics can be applied in an industrial setting to inform factory or plant managers when machinery needs maintenance or replacement.\n\nConsumers can purchase energy-efficient appliances to decrease their energy bills. Investors can determine the efficiency of their investments by usingreturn on investment (ROI), which highlights an investment\u2019s return relative to how much it costs.\n\nConsumer appliances such as refrigerators, washers, and dryers marked with anENERGY STARlabel meet strict energy-efficiency specifications set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nEfficiency is measurable and expressed as a ratio or percentage:\n\nOutput (or work output) is the total amount of useful work completed without accounting for any waste and spoilage. To express efficiency as a percentage, multiply the ratio by 100.\n\nIn financial markets, operational efficiency occurs when transaction costs and fees are reduced.\n\nAdvances in efficiency allow greater productivity in less time. Goods that are produced efficiently can be sold at a lower price. Advances in efficiency in home electricity,\u00a0running water, and transportation have historically facilitated higherstandards of living. Breakthroughs in economic efficiency often coincide with the invention of new tools, including the steam engines and motor vehicles that emerged during theIndustrial Revolution.\n\nMany scientists developed practices to optimize specific task performance. One famous example is the novelCheaper by the Dozenby Frank Bunker Gilbreth Jr. and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey. In the book, systems are presented to maximize efficiency in even the most mundane tasks, such as brushing teeth.\n\nIndustry 4.0 is the Fourth Industrial Revolution characterized by digitalization. Factory processes, manufacturing, and service industries are all more efficient, thanks to more powerful computers,cloud computing, theInternet of Things (IoT), data analytics, robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), andmachine learning.\n\nAllocative efficiency occurs in an efficient market when capital is allocated in the best way possible to benefit each party involved. It is the even distribution of goods and services, financial services, and other key elements to consumers, businesses, and other entities.Allocative efficiencyfacilitates decision-making and economic growth.\n\nPeak efficiency occurs when all capital, resources, and individual participants are properly allocated and fully functional to the best of their ability.\n\nAn investment\u2019s measure of efficiency is its return on investment (ROI). This is the way investors and financial professionals measure how efficiently an investment makes a profit. This metric compares one investment to another or multiple investments, such as mutual funds that invest in the same asset class. ROI can be expressed as a ratio by dividing an investment\u2019s return by its cost. It can also be expressed as a percentage by multiplying the result by 100.\n\nBusinesses that run efficiently reduce their costs and improve their bottom lines. The efficiency formula shows individuals and entities how well their inputs are used when producing output.\n\nIBM. \"How Does AI Improve Efficiency?\"\n\nCarvalho, Thyago P., et al. \u201cA Systematic Literature Review of Machine Learning Methods Applied to Predictive Maintenance.\u201dComputers & Industrial Engineering, vol.\u00a0137, 2019, 106024.\n\nU.S Environmental Protection Agency. \"Energy Efficient Products.\"\n\nFama, Eugene F. \u201cEfficient Capital Markets: A Review of Theory and Empirical Work.\u201dThe Journal of Finance, vol.\u00a025, no. 2. 1970, pp. 383\u2013417.\n\nFrank B.
