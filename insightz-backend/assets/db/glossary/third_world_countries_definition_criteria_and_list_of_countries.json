  "term": "Third World Countries: Definition, Criteria, and List of Countries",
  "definition": "Peter Westfall is a distinguished professor of information systems and quantitative sciences at Texas Tech University. He specializes in using statistics in investing, technical analysis, and trading.\n\nCertain nations were categorized as Third World countries in the last half of the 20th century. This is now considered an outdated and derogatory phrase used to describe nations that were economically underdeveloped and had little or no affiliation with major world powers.\n\nThe Third World countries occupied one of four segments that identified nations by their relative economic standing. Roughly, the major world powers and their economic and political allies were First World countries, allies of the Soviet Union were Second World countries, underdeveloped nations were Third World countries, and nations that were entirely isolated from global politics and economics were the Fourth World.\n\nToday, the preferred terminology categorizes a nation as a developing country, an underdeveloped country, or a low- andmiddle-income country (LMIC).\n\nClassifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept that was created soon after the end of World War II in 1945 and used until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nNations are often characterized by their economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, lack of sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.\n\nDeveloping nations are closely watched by theInternational Monetary Fund(IMF) and theWorld Bank, which provide grants and loans that help struggling nations improve their infrastructure and economic systems.\n\nBoth organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.\n\nDeveloping nations, or LMICs, are of particular interest to investors seeking to identify growth opportunities. Both their risks and their returns are relatively high. Developing countries are generally characterized as economic underperformers, but innovation and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.\n\nThe classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during the Cold War. First-world countries were known as highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization andcapitalism.\n\nSecond-world countries hadcommunistsystems and most were allied with the Soviet Union. These included the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe and some Asia nations.\n\nThird-world countries\u00a0included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union.\n\nNow, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive.\n\nAlfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy\u00a0observed a group of countries, many of them former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism.\n\n\"Three worlds, one planet,\" wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published inL'Observateur.\n\nMost nations today fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The former world segmentations have been fit into these categories for the most part.\n\nThe developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economic indicators.\n\nMSCI\u2019s Frontier Markets Index can serve as a list of developing countries.The index includes the following countries:\n\nThe World Trade Organization provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though their statuses can be contested by other nations.\n\nEach WTO segregation comes with certain opportunities for the nations. WTO projects are designed to increase trading opportunities and improve infrastructure.\n\nAs an offshoot of the WTO, theHuman Development Index(HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on education, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita.\n\nThe World Health Organization and the United Nations use Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators. This list is reassessed every few years.\n\nThe indicators are a combination of gross national income, human assets (nutrition, life expectancy, secondary school education, adult literacy), and economic vulnerability (population size, remoteness, merchandise export concentration, agriculture, exports, and natural disaster preparedness).\n\nThe phrase Third World was used to characterize nations that existed outside the economic and political ties that bind the industrialized countries around the world. Many are former colonies of European nations.\n\nThe term Third World is today considered pejorative. A nation might now be considered developing or frontier. A developing nation is intent on improving the infrastructure, education system, health system, and trade ties that are necessary to improve living standards. A frontier nation might be just beginning that process.\n\nThere also are the nations that the United Nations terms the \"least developed.\" Formerly termed the Fourth World nations, they remain isolated from the rest of the world's economic systems, technology, and politics.\n\nThe term First World collectively means the highly industrialized nations with capitalist economies. Although the term is largely outdated, the list of First World nations today would include Japan as well as the nations of North America and Western Europe. It might arguably also include some Eastern European, South American, and Asian nations.\n\nThe term frontier nation is used primarily by investment professionals who specialize in international investing. It describes a nation that seems poised for fast economic development. Investments in these countries is seen as offering potentially high rewards at substantially high risk.\n\nThe term Third World was coined in a very different time. In the wake of World War II, it seemed reasonable to classify nations as capitalist powers (the First World), communist countries (the Second World), and countries that are neither (the Third World).\n\nCurrent classifications will probably seem equally outdated in 70 years. But for now, there are developed nations, developing nations, and underdeveloped nations.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Factsheet-The IMF and The World Bank.\"\n\nMarcin Wojciech Solarz. \"\u2018Third World\u2019: The 60th Anniversary of a Concept That Changed History.\" Third World Quarterly, 2012.\n\nMSCI Inc. \"MSCI Announces the Results of the 2021 Annual Market Classification Review.\"\n\nMSCI Inc. \"MSCI Announces the Results of the 2021 Annual Market Classification Review.\"\n\nWorld Trade Organization. \"Who Are the Developing Countries in the WTO?\"\n\nUnited Nations. \"List of Least Developed Countries (as of 18 December 2023).\"\n\nWorld Health Organization. \"Least Developed Countries Health and WHO Country Presence Profile.\"",
