Managed by the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) and administered by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), this exam aims to ensure that securities agents understand state-specific regulations and ethical practices.\n\nThe exam reflects the evolving landscape of financial regulation in the U.S. The Series 63 exam has been instrumental in shaping how securities are sold and who is allowed to sell them, ensuring that financial representatives adhere to ethical standards that protect investors. The exam was born out of necessity\u2014an effort to unify a patchwork of state regulations that once made it almost impossible for brokers to operate across state lines.\n\nBelow, we take you through what you need to know about the Series 63, what's on it, and what it means for the professionals who have to take it.\n\nIn the late 1970s, as financial markets expanded rapidly, so did the complexity of the regulations governing them. Each state had its own rules, creating a labyrinthine legal environment for securities professionals. Brokers faced the daunting task of navigating inconsistent state laws, which often meant passing multiple exams just to conduct business in neighboring states. Recognizing the problem,NASAAintroduced the Series 63 exam in 1979 as a standardized test for professionals to qualify across most states.\n\nThe Series 63 was more than just a convenience forbrokers. It represented a significant shift toward regulatory consistency and investor protection. The exam covers the principles of state securities regulation, focusing on rules that prevent fraud, promote transparency, and ensure fair dealing. As financial markets became more interconnected, the importance of a common regulatory framework grew, eventually making the Series 63 a cornerstone for broker registration.\n\nThe Series exams are a group of securities licensing exams administered by FINRA and NASAA. Each is designed to test specific knowledge and skills required for different roles within the securities industry.\n\nThe exam tests knowledge of state securities regulations, particularly the rules governing ethical business practices and investor protection. Unlike other exams focusing on federal securities laws, the Series 63 exam emphasizes \u201cblue sky laws\u201d againstfinancial fraudthat regulate securities at the state level, ensuring that representatives understand the legal obligations they must uphold within individual states.\n\nThe exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions on registration procedures, ethical practices, fiduciary duties, and the handling of client accounts. Candidates must correctly answer at least 43 questions to pass.While the exam is shorter and less comprehensive than other securities exams, like the Series 7, its focus on the legal and ethical framework makes it crucial for those seeking to engage in the securities business across multiple states.\n\nPassing the Series 63 is typically required in addition to other qualifications, like theSeries 6 or Series 7, making it a foundational credential for anyone looking to sell securities or provide investment advice. The exam's emphasis on state-specific regulations helps ensure that securities professionals can navigate the complexities of different legal environments, ultimately protecting investors and promoting market integrity.\n\nAgents must acquire the Series 63 license, in addition to a Series 7 or Series 6 license, to sell securities.\n\nFINRA administers the exam. Here's how you schedule it, depending on your employment:\n\nThe Series 63 exam consists of 65 multiple-choice questions with four possible answers for each. Of these, 60 are scored, while five are unscored pretest questions. To pass, candidates must correctly answer at least 43 of the 60 scored questions within a 75-minute time limit.\n\nThe exam is designed to measure a candidate's performance against a predetermined standard, rather than comparing their performance to that of other test-takers. In short, you understand going in what you need to know and how many questions you must get correct to pass.\n\nThe Series 63 exam employs a method known as \"on-the-fly testing\" to ensure fairness, security, and consistency. Here's what that means:\n\nThe Series 63 tests knowledge of so-called \"blue sky laws.\" These refer to state laws slowly developed before and during the Great Depression that regulate the offering and sale of securities to protect the public from fraud.\u00a0The phrase derives from a passage in a U.S. Supreme Court case,\u00a0Hall v. Geiger Jones Co. (1917), that described \u201cspeculative schemes which have no more basis than so many feet of \u2018blue sky.\u2019\"\n\nAfter a failed attempt at the Series 63 exam, the following waiting periods apply:\n\nAfter passing the Series 63 exam, candidates have two years to obtain a state license; otherwise, the exam results will expire in FINRA'sCentral Registration Depository.\n\nThe exam remains valid as long as you're registered, with a two-year grace period between jobs. State regulators may grant waivers to individuals who continue working in the financial services industry in a different capacity. While passing the exam may fulfill part of a state's requirements, it doesn't grant the right to conduct business until you're licensed or registered by that state.\n\nShould you need to leave a firm, your employer will file Form U5 to cancel the registration, and then you'll have two years to secure new employment and re-register. The new employer will submit Form U4 for re-registration.\n\nThe Series 63 covers eight general subjects related to the professional responsibilities of broker-dealer agents. The subjects, weightings, and number of questions are as follows:\n\n1.Regulation of Investment Advisers\n\n2.Regulations of Investment Adviser Representatives\n\n4.Regulations of Agents of Broker-Dealers\n\n5.Regulations of Securities and Issuers\n\n6.Remedies and Administrative Provisions Weight\n\n7.Communication with Customers and Prospects\n\n8.Ethical Practices and Obligations Weight\n\nThe Series 63 exam is often required in addition to other exams, particularly for those who will be selling securities across state lines. Other notable exams include the Series 7, which covers federal securities laws and is a major qualification for many broker-dealer representatives; theSeries 65, which focuses on investment adviser laws and practices; and the Series 66, which combines elements of both the Series 63 and 65.\n\nWhile the Series 63 is generally considered less comprehensive than some other exams, it plays a vital role in ensuring that securities professionals understand and follow state-specific regulations. This state-level focus complements the federal-level knowledge tested in exams like the Series 7, creating a comprehensive regulatory framework for the industry.\n\nThe table below compares the key Series exams, highlighting their focus, format, and relevance to different career paths in financial services:\n\nTypically, candidates should consider taking the\u00a0Series 7\u00a0first if they want a broad career in securities sales because it provides the most comprehensive licensing and allows for selling a wider range of products. Following the Series 7, candidates can take the\u00a0Series 63\u00a0to meet state-specific requirements. If a candidate focuses on mutual funds and variable products, they may opt for the\u00a0Series 6\u00a0instead, especially if they work in an insurance context.\n\nTo take the Series 63 exam, candidates must be at least 18 years old. There are no specific age or educational requirements beyond this minimum. The exam is necessary for individuals who wish to become registered representatives and sell securities in most U.S. states. While the Series 63 is required in many states, some\u2014including Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico\u2014do not mandate it.\n\nMany professionals consider theSeries 7exam to be the most challenging. The exam, which allows candidates to sell a wide range of securities, consists of 125 questions with a passing score of 72% and a time limit of 225 minutes. This comprehensiveness requires a deep understanding of various financial products, regulations, and market practices.\n\nThe Series 63 is a mandatory requirement for securities registration in most U.S. states. Some states, such as Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana, do not require the Series 63 for securities registration. However, it's important to check the specific regulations of the state where you intend to conduct business. Even if a state doesn't mandate the Series 63, individualbroker-dealersmight still require their representatives to pass the exam as part of their internal compliance procedures.\n\nThe Series 63 exam is a critical qualification for securities professionals in the U.S. Developed by NASAA, this exam focuses on state-level securities laws and regulations, often called \"blue sky laws.\" The primary purpose of the Series 63 is to ensure that securities agents understand and can follow the state-specific regulatory requirements that complement federal securities laws. Most states require passing the Series 63 as a condition for registration of securities agents who conduct business within their borders, making it an essential credential for many financial professionals.\n\nThe exam consists of 65 multiple-choice questions, of which 60 are scored, and candidates have 75 minutes to complete it. A score of 72% (43 out of 60 correct answers) is required to pass. Unlike more comprehensive exams like the Series 7, which covers a broad range of securities knowledge, the Series 63 is narrowly focused on state regulations, ethical practices, and the basic principles of state securities acts. It's often taken with other securities exams, particularly by those seeking to become registered representatives in the broker-dealer industry.\n\nNASAA.\"Series 63 Exam Content Outline.\"\n\nFINRA. \"Series 63 \u2013 Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam.\"\n\nFINRA. \"Series 63 \u2013 Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam.\"\n\nFINRA. \"Exam Credit and Exam Validity.\"\n\nNASAA. \"Uniform Securities Agent State Law Examination (Series 63) Overview.\" Page 6\n\nFINRA.\"Series 7 \u2013 General Securities Representative Exam\"\n\nFINRA. \"CRD System AG Qualification Requirements.\"",
