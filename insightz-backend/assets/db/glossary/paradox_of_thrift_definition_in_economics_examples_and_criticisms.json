  "definition": "The paradox of thrift is an economic theory\u00a0that personal savings are a net drag on the economy during arecession. Also referred to as the paradox of savings, this theory relies on the assumption that prices don't clear or that producers fail to adjust to changing conditions, contrary to the expectations ofclassicalmicroeconomics.\n\nThe paradox of thrift was popularized by British economist John Maynard Keynes.\n\nThe proper response to an economic recession is more spending, more risk-taking, and fewer savings, according toKeynesian theory. Keynesians believe that a recessed economy doesn't produce at full capacity because some of its factors of production such as land, labor, and capital are unemployed.\n\nKeynesians also argue that consumption or spending drives economic growth. It's the wrong prescription for the larger economy even though it makes sense for individuals and households to reduce consumption during tough times.\n\nA pullback in aggregateconsumer spendingmight force businesses to produce even less, deepening the recession. This disconnect between individual and group rationality is the basis of the savings paradox.\n\nThe savings rate for the average American household increased from 2.9% to 5% during theGreat Recessionthat followed thefinancial crisis of 2008. TheFederal Reserveslashed interest rates to boost spending in the American economy.\n\nThe first conceptual description of the paradox of thrift may have been written in Bernard Mandeville\u2019sThe Fable of the Beesin 1714. Mandeville argued for increased expenditure rather than savings as the key to prosperity. Keynes credited Mandeville for the concept in his bookThe General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Moneyin 1936.\n\nKeynes helped revive thecircular flow modelof the economy. This theory states that an increase in current spending drives future spending. Current spending results in more income for current producers that rationally deploy their new income, sometimes expanding business and hiring new workers. These new workers earn new income that can then be spent.\n\nKeynes argued for lower interest rates to lower currentsavings ratesand boost current spending. Keynes said that the government could engage in deficit spending to fill the gap if low interest rates didn't create more borrowing and spending.\n\nThe circular flow model ignores the lesson ofSay\u2019s lawwhich states that goods must be produced before they can be exchanged. Capital machines drive higher levels of production and require additional savings and investment. The circular flow model only works in a framework without capital goods.\n\nThe theory also ignores the potential forinflationordeflation. Future production and employment will remain unchanged if higher current spending causes future prices to rise concordantly. Future production and employment needn't decline as Keynes predicted if current thrift during a recession forces future prices to fall.\n\nThe paradox of thrift ignores the potential for saved income to be lent out by banks. Interest rates tend to fall and banks make additional loans when some individuals increase their savings.\n\nKeynes met these objections by arguing that Say\u2019s law was wrong and prices are too rigid to adjust efficiently. Economists remain divided about sticky prices. It's widely accepted that Keynes misrepresented Say\u2019s law in his refutation.\n\nIvan owns a factory that produces parts for computers. The factory is among town XYZ's biggest employers. They've been planning to expand their production capacity by installing more machines and hiring new workers.\n\nBut a recession strikes and Ivan reverts to savings mode. The factorylays offworkers and discontinues operating the machines at night. Unemployed factory workers who don't have income to spend also begin saving, reducingdemandfor goods produced by Ivan's factory. The unemployed factory workers also add to the town's overall spending on social benefits and its economy becomes weak.\n\nA real-world example of the savings paradox was the case of 25- to 29-year-olds who moved in with their parents during the Great Recession. Their percentage increased from 14% in 2005 to 19% in 2011. The move helped families save money on rent and other expenses but it caused estimated damages to the economy of as much as $25 billion per year.\n\nThe personal savings rate increased to almost 30% in 2020. U.S. households held about $2.3 trillion in savings in that year. Those figures began plunging by the end of 2021.\n\nSay's Law is attributed to John Baptiste Say, a French economist. \u201cIt is worthwhile to remark that a product is no sooner created than it, from that instant, affords a market for other products to the full extent of its own value,\" said Say in 1803.\n\nA recession is said by some to occur when an economy has suffered two consecutive quarters of falling gross domestic product (GDP). But this isn't an official definition because there are no quantifiable terms of a recession on record.\n\nThe National Bureau of Economic Research puts it this way: A recession is \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\"\n\nThe paradox of thrift is an economic theory espoused by British Economist John Maynard Keynes. It holds that personal savings hurt overall economic health and growth. The theory urges lowering interest rates to increase spending and combat an economic recession and it has its critics. It doesn\u2019t address inflation or deflation in prices. Your savings are a highly personal matter and should meet your personal circumstances and needs.\n\nBritannica Money. \"The Paradox of Thrift: Understanding Economic Behavior in Recessions.\"\n\nEconomic Research Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Wait, Is Savings Good or Bad?
