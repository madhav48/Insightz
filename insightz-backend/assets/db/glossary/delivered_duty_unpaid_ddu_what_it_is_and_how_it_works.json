  "term": "Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU): What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) is\u00a0an old international trade term indicating that\u00a0the seller is responsible for the safe delivery of goods to a named destination. The seller pays all transportation expenses and assumes all risks during transport.\n\nThe buyer becomes responsible for paying import duties when the goods arrive at the agreed-upon location as well as further transport costs.Delivered Duty Paid (DDP)indicates that the seller must cover duties, import clearance, and any taxes, however.\n\nThe International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) was originally formed after\u00a0World War I to foster prosperity in Europe\u00a0by setting standards for international trade. This group published a set of standardized terms for types of shipping agreements in 1936, known as Incoterms.\n\nIncoterms\u00a0are contract specifications that outline who bears the costs and risks ofinternational transactions. They're subject to change at the discretion of the ICC.\u00a0The ICC seeks to simplify matters for businesses by standardizing its terms because of the legal and logistical intricacies of international shipping.\n\nThe 2023 Incoterms revision isavailable for purchasedirectly from the site.\n\nDelivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) isn't included in the most recent 2023 edition of the International Chamber of Commerce'sIncoterms. The official term that best describes the function of DDU is now\u00a0\"Delivered-at-Place (DAP).\"\n\nDDU is\u00a0still commonly used in international trade parlance, however.\u00a0The term is followed by the location of delivery on paper, such as \"DDU: Port of Los Angeles.\"\n\nDelivered at Place Unloaded (DPU) is another term used to differentiate between shipping methods. The seller is also responsible for unloading the goods at the place of destination under DPU.\n\nThe seller secures licenses and takes care of other formalities involved in exporting a good according to DDU arrangements. It's also responsible for all licenses and costs incurred in transit countries as well as for providing\u00a0an invoice at its own cost.\n\nThe seller assumes all risk until the goods are delivered to the specified location but it has no obligation to obtain insurance on the goods.\n\nThe buyer is responsible for obtaining all necessary licenses for importing the goods and paying all relevant taxes,duties, and inspection costs. All risks involved in this process are borne\u00a0by the buyer. All further transportation costs and risks fall on the buyer when the goods are placed at the disposal of the buyer.\n\nDelivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) means that it's the customer's responsibility to pay for any of the destination country's customs charges, duties, or taxes. These must all be paid for customs to release the shipment after it arrives.\n\nDelivered Duty Paid (DDP) means that it's the shipper's responsibility to pay any of the customs charges, duties, and/or taxes that are required to send the product to the destination country.\n\nThe primary benefit of Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) shipping is that it gives the buyer more control over the shipping procedures. Having a higher degree of control over the process can be paramount for global buyers looking to keep a consistent flow of inventory.\n\nControlling costs and tracking shipments are typically easier under DDU shipping than in DDP shipping. Buyers are naturally more knowledgeable of their own country's shipping customs.\n\nFrom the seller's perspective, DDU shipping provides the ability to take more of a \"hands-off\" approach when it comes to the destination country's shipping rules. The seller is simply responsible for getting the cargo to its destination where the buyer can handle all the legal complications.\n\nThere are also disadvantages to DDU shipping. The biggest problem for buyers is the possibility of surprise duties or tax charges when their shipment finally arrives. That's a big negative for buyers but it's not ideal for shippers either because disgruntled customers may refuse to pay for their parcel to be delivered.\n\nThere are pros and cons to each method of shipping. It ultimately boils down to what the buyer or receiver wants out of their shipping experience.\n\nDDU is a good option if the receiver prioritizes control of the shipping process and doesn't mind the legal complications or surprise charges that come with more control. But DDP is probably the way to go if a buyer wants a streamlined process without the possibility of any surprise charges.\n\nThe seller is fully responsible for the delivery of the goods to the destination country under DDU shipping rules. The seller assumes all risks involved up to unloading. The buyer bears the risk and cost of the unloading.\n\nDelivered-at-Place (DAP) was introduced in 2010 to replace the term Delivered Duty Unpaid (DDU) so they're essentially the same.\n\nFrom the seller's perspective, DDU shipping provides the ability to take more of a \"hands-off\" approach when it comes to the destination country's shipping rules. The biggest problem for buyers in DDU shipping is the possibility of surprise duties and/or tax charges when their shipment finally arrives. The term \"Delivered-at-Place (DAP) has been used in place of DDU since 2010. Look for this updated term if you have questions regarding shipments or deliveries.\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms Rules History.\"\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \"Know Your Incoterms.\"\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms 2020.\" Select \"Is the Incoterms rule DPU new?\"\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \"2.1 Delivery Methods.\"\n\nInternational Chamber of Commerce. \"Incoterms Rules 2010.\"",
