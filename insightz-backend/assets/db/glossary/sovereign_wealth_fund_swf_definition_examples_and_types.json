SWFs provide a benefit for a country's economy and its citizens.\n\nThe funding for a sovereign wealth fund\u00a0can come from a variety of sources. Popular sources are surplus reserves from state-owned natural resource revenues, trade surpluses,bank reservesthat may accumulate from budgeting excesses, foreign currency operations, money from privatizations, and governmental transfer payments.\n\nIn general, sovereign wealth funds usually have a targeted purpose. Some countries have sovereign wealth funds that can be similar to venture capital for the private sector.\n\nSimilar to any type of investment fund, SWFs have their own objectives, terms, risk tolerances, liability matches, and liquidity concerns. Some funds may prefer returns over liquidity and vice versa. Depending on the assets and objectives, sovereign wealth funds\u2019 risk management can range from very conservative to a high tolerance for risk.\n\nTraditional classifications of\u00a0sovereign wealth funds\u00a0include:\n\nThe amount of money in a\u00a0SWF is usually substantial. The acceptable investments included in each SWF vary from fund to fund and country to country. Countries can create or dissolve SWFs to match the needs of their population.
