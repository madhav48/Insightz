He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA grant deed, also known as a special or limited warranty deed, is a legal document used to transfer real estate between a previous owner (thegrantor) and a new owner (thegrantee). A grant deed warrants that:\n\nA grant deed must be in writing and include the names of the grantor and the grantee, a legal description of the property being transferred (i.e., lot number, tract number, city, county, and state), words ofconveyance\u2014for example, \u201cgrant, bargain, sell, and convey\u201d\u2014and the grantor\u2019s signature.\n\nAdeedis a legal document that, when executed and delivered, conveys title to or an interest in real estate from a seller to a buyer.There are a variety of deeds, including quitclaim deeds, general warranty deeds, and grant deeds. Each type of deed offers different levels of protection (and risks) to buyers and sellers.\n\nA grant deed\u00a0includes two warranties: that the grantor received title, and that the property was unencumbered by the grantor. It does not contain any information to pay legal costs if a title claim needs to be defended. It also does not provide any warranties to claims made before the title was acquired by the grantor.\n\nThis type of deed offers less protection to buyers than a general warranty deed\u2014a deed in which the grantor fully warrants good, clear title to the property. However, a grant deed offers more protection to buyers than a quitclaim deed, which has no express or implied covenants or warranties.\n\nGrant deeds are often used to transfer real estate in conjunction with tax andforeclosuresales. Grant deeds are seen as a middle ground between quitclaim deeds and general warranty deeds, as grant deeds provide a level of protection between the two.\n\nThere are several types of grant deeds, depending on who transfers property to whom. For example, an interspousal transfer grant deed is used to transfer real estate from one spouse to another (often during a divorce).\n\nAll deeds must contain the names of the grantor and the grantee, the date, an overview of the property being transferred, and the signature of the grantor. A majority of deeds will require the stamp of anotaryas well as the signatures of witnesses.\n\nIn addition to the above, a grant deed will contain a statement of the warranties included. The overall content and format of a grant deed will depend on the law of the state where the property is located.\n\nReal estate, including real property, is often described as anasset classalong with stocks, bonds, cash, and alternative investments such as private equity and venture capital.\n\nReal property consists of land and any property attached directly to it (such as buildings, ponds, canals, roads, and machinery) and can entail the right to use, control, and dispose of the land.\n\nAs an investment, real estate is unique in that its location significantly impacts prices. For example, residential real estate values are affected by local factors such as the area\u2019s employment rate, economy, crime rates, transportation facilities, quality of schools, and other municipal services, along withproperty taxes.\n\nIn commercial real estate, which is often more valuable per square foot than residential real estate, these factors are also pertinent, although less so. Commercial rental real estate is more heavily regulated than residential real estate, with specific regulations existing between countries, states, and even cities and counties.Zoningregulations can add further complexity to commercial real estate investments along with the risk of tenant turnover.\n\nThose interested can invest directly in real estate (where grant deeds might come into play) or indirectly by buying shares inreal estate investment trusts (REITs)ormortgage-backed securities (MBS).\n\nThere are other variations of a deed, including (but not limited to):\n\nGrant deeds are not the same as a mortgage. Grant deeds (and other types of deeds) are used to transfer real estate ownership from a seller to a buyer. On the other hand, amortgageis a conditional transfer or pledge of real estate as security (collateral) for the payment of a debt.\n\nGrant deeds and quitclaim deeds are used to transfer property between sellers and buyers; however, grant deeds offer more protection to buyers than quitclaim deeds. A grant deed grantor warrants that theproperty was not encumberedduring the time they held title (except as noted in the deed).\n\nConversely, a quitclaim deed carries no covenants or warranties and only conveys the interest (if any) that the grantor may have when the deed is delivered. If the grantor has no interest in the property, then the grantee acquires nothing by virtue of a quitclaim deed.\n\nFor real estate buyers, a general warranty deed provides greater protection than any other type of deed. While it\u2019s the best deed for the grantee, it gives the grantor the most liability. The grantor is generally bound by several covenants, including:\n\nA deed is a written document that conveystitle to or an interest in real estatewhen executed and delivered. Grant deeds fall in the middle of the spectrum in terms of buyer protections\u2014they offer more protection than quitclaim deeds, but less than general warranty deeds.\n\nA deed determines the grantor\u2019s obligations and the degree of protection that the grantee receives. As such, it\u2019s essential to understand the type of deed used in a real estate transaction\u2014whether you\u2019re the buyer or the seller. Similarly, real estate laws vary by state. Consult with a qualified real estate attorney, broker, or agent if you have questions.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \u201cGrant Deed.\u201d\n\nNorth Carolina Department of the Secretary of State. \u201cReading a Deed and Determining Its Stated Intent.\u201d",
