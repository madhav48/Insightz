  "term": "What Is Web 2.0? Definition, Impact, and Examples",
  "definition": "Web 2.0 is a term used to refer to the second stage of the Internet, which has more user-generated content, greater usability for end-users, a more participatory culture, and more inoperability compared to its earlier (first) incarnation, Web 1.0, which was dominated by static websites. Web 2.0 does not describe a formal change in the Internet itself\u2014there were no specific technical upgrades to the Internet\u2014only a change in how 21st-century Internet applications have transformed the way the Internet is used.\n\nThe term \"Web 2.0\" was first used by Darcy DiNucci in 1999, in an article called \"Fragmented Future\" in the magazinePrint.The Internet was pivoting toward a system that actively engaged the user, and users were encouraged to provide content\u2014rather than just viewing it.\n\nThe social aspect of the Internet has been particularly transformed; in general,social mediaallows users to engage and interact with one another by sharing thoughts, perspectives, and opinions. Web 2.0 does not refer to any specific technical upgrades to the Internet.\u00a0It simply refers to changes in how the Internet was used beginning in the 21st century.\n\nWeb 2.0 created a higher level of information sharing and interconnectedness among participants.\u00a0The second version of the Internet allows users to actively participate in the experience\u2014rather than just acting as passive viewers who take in information.\n\nPeople can publish articles and\u00a0comments on different platforms, increasing engaged content creation and participation through the creation of accounts on different sites. Web 2.0 also gave rise to web apps, self-publishing platforms\u2014such asWordPress, Medium, and Substack\u2014and\u00a0social media\u00a0sites.Wikipedia, Facebook, X (formally Twitter) have all been particularly influential in defining Web 2.0 because they have transformed the way the same information is shared and delivered.\n\nIn the article \"Fragmented Future,\" published in 1999, Darcy DiNucci said the \"first glimmerings\" of this new stage of the web were beginning to appear. DiNucci describes Web 2.0 as a \"transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens.\"\n\nThe phrase became popularized after a 2004 conference held by O'Reilly Media and MediaLive International. Tim O'Reilly, founder andchief executive officer (CEO)of O'Reilly Media, is credited with the streamlining of some of the processes conducive to creating Web 2.0; he hosted various interviews and Web 2.0 conferences to explore the early business models for web content.\n\nThe interworking of Web 2.0 has continually evolved over the years. Instead of a single instance of Web 2.0 having been created, its definition and capabilities continue to change. For example, Justin Hall is credited as being one of the first bloggers, though his personal blog dates back to 1994.\n\nThe development of technology\u00a0has allowed\u00a0users to share their thoughts and opinions with others, creating new ways of organizing and connecting with other people. One of the largest advantages of Web 2.0 is improved communication via web applications, which enhances interactivity, collaboration, and the sharing of knowledge.\n\nThis is most evident through social networking, where individuals armed with a Web 2.0 connection can publish content, share ideas, extract information, and subscribe to various informational feeds. This has brought about major strides in marketing optimization because more strategic, targetedmarketingapproaches are now possible.\n\nWeb 2.0 also brings about a certain level of accessibility. Most individuals have an equal chance of posting their views and comments, and each individual may build a network of contacts. Because information may be transmitted more quickly in this stage of the Internet (compared to prior methods of information sharing), the latest news and innovative ideas may be available to more people.\n\nUnfortunately, there are a lot of disadvantages to the Internet acting like an open forum. Certain phenomena, such as online stalking,doxing, cyberbullying,identity theft, and other online crimes, have been connected to the expansion of social media. There is also the threat of misinformation spreading among users, whether that's through open-source information-sharing\u00a0sites or on social media.\n\nIndividuals may blame Web 2.0 for misinformation, information overload, or the unreliability of what people read. Because almost anyone can post anything via various blogs and social media (or other Web 2.0 outlets), there is an increased risk of confusion on what information is trustworthy and what sources may be deemed reliable.\n\nAs a result, Web 2.0 creates higher stakes for communication. It's more likely to have fake accounts, spammers, forgers, orhackersthat attempt to steal information, imitate personas, or trick unsuspecting Internet users into following their agenda. Because Web 2.0 cannot always verify information, there is a heightened risk for bad actors to take advantage of opportunities.\n\nWeb 1.0 is used to describe the first stage of the internet. At this point, there were few content creators; most of those using the Internet were consumers. Static pages were more common than dynamicHTML, which incorporates interactive and animated websites with specific coding or language.\n\nContent in this stage came from a server\u2019s file system, rather than a database management system. Users were able to sign online guestbooks and HTML forms were sent via email. Examples of internet sites that are classified as Web 1.0 are Britannica Online, personal websites, and mp3.com. In general, these websites are considered static because they have limited functionality and flexibility.\n\nDynamic information (always changing)\n\nPromotes greater collaboration, because channels are more dynamic and flexible\n\nConsidered more social and interactive-driven\n\nStatic information (more difficult to change)\n\nPromoted individual contribution; channels were less dynamic\n\nConsidered more informative and data-driven\n\nThe world is already shifting into the next iteration of the web (appropriately dubbed \"Web 3.0\"). Though both rely on many similar technologies, they use these available capabilities to solve problems differently.\n\nOne strong example of Web 3.0 relates to currency. Under Web 2.0, users could inputfiat currencyinformation, such as bank account information or credit card data. This information could be processed by the receiver to allow for transactions. Web 3.0 strives to approach the transaction process using different processes. With the introduction of Bitcoin,Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies, the same problem can be solved in a theoretically more efficient way.\n\nWeb 3.0 is more heavily rooted in increasing the trust between users. More often, applications rely on decentralization, letting data be exchanged in several locations simultaneously. Web 3.0 is also more likely to incorporate artificial intelligence or machine learning applications.\n\nFocuses on reading and writing content\n\nMay be more susceptible to less-secure technology\n\nMay use more antiquated, simpler processing techniques\n\nPrimarily aims to connect people\n\nOften has more robust cybersecurity measures\n\nMay incorporate more advanced concepts, such as AI or machine learning\n\nPrimarily aims to connect data or information\n\nThere is no single, universally-accepted definition for Web 2.0. Instead, it's best described as a series of components that, when put together, create an online environment of interactivity and greater capacity compared to the original version of the web. Here are the more prominent components of Web 2.0.\n\nWikis are often information repositories that collect input from various users. Users may edit, update, and change the information within a web page, meaning there is often no singular owner of the page or the information within. As opposed to users simply absorbing information given to them, wiki-based sites such as Wikipedia are successful when users contribute information to the site.\n\nThe early days of the web relied upon local software being installed on-premises. With Web 2.0, applications gained a greater opportunity to be housed off-site, downloaded over the web, or even offered as a service via web applications andcloud computing. This has shepherded a new type of business model where companies can sell software applications on a monthly subscription basis.\n\nOften one of the aspects most thought of when discussing Web 2.0.Social networkingis similar to wikis in that individuals are empowered to post information on the web. Whereas wikis are informational and often require verification, social networking has looser constraints on what can be posted. In addition, users have greater capabilities to interact and connect with other social networking users.\n\nIn addition to social media posts, users can more easily post artwork, images, audio, video, or other user-generated media. This information shared online for purchase or may be freely distributed. This has led to greater distribution of content creator crediting (though creators are at greater risk for their content being stolen by others).\n\nThough many may think of Web 2.0 as allowing for individual contribution, Web 2.0 brought about great capabilities regarding crowdsourced,crowdfunded, and crowd-tested content. Web 2.0 let individuals collectively share resources to meet a common goal, whether that goal be knowledge-based or financial.\n\nThere is no single, universally-accepted definition for Web 2.0 or Web 3.0. Because of its expansive nature, it's often hard to confine the boundaries of Web 2.0 into a single simple definition.\n\nThe components above are directly related to the applications of Web 2.0. Those components allowed for new types of software, platforms, or applications that are still used today.\n\nWeb 2.0 is a term that describes the second iteration of the Internet, which is a more advanced, capable, and robust system than the initial version of the web. After the initial breakthrough of the Internet, more technologies were developed to allow users to more freely interact and contribute to the Internet ecosphere. The ability for web users to be more connected to other web users is at the core of Web 2.0.\n\nThe most commonly cited examples of Web 2.0 applications include Facebook, X, Instagram, or Tiktok. These sites allow users to interact with web pages instead of simply viewing them. Wikipedia is also an example of a Web 2.0 application because a broad range of users help create information that is shared and distributed on the web.\n\nWeb 2.0 and Web 3.0 use many of the same technologies (AJAX, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3). Web 3.0 is more likely to leverage even more modern technologies or principles in an attempt to connect people to other people (and people to information).\n\nIn the early days of web browsing, users would often navigate to simple web pages, filled with information and limited-to-no ability to interact with the page. Today, the web has advanced and allows for users to connect with others, contribute information, and have greater flexibility in how the web is being used. Though Web 2.0 is already shaping the way for Web 3.0, many of the fundamental pieces of Web 2.0 are still used today.\n\nDarcy DiNucci. \"Fragmented Future.\"\n\nO'Reilly. \"Web 2.0 and the Emergent Internet Operating System.\"\n\nUniversity of Notre Dame of Maryland. \"History of Blogging.\"",
