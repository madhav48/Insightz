In the last few years \u201cshop local\u201d and \u201cshop small\u201d have been used as slogans in marketing campaigns to support these smaller establishments.The term \u201cmom-and-pop\u201d can also refer to inexperienced investors who casually play the market.\n\nMom-and-pop stores historically were local family-owned-and-operated general stores or drugstores. Today, mom-and-pop establishments are synonymous with various different types of businesses, including restaurants, bookstores, automotive repair shops, and insurance agencies.\n\nIn many ways mom-and-pop businesses stand at a steep disadvantage to large corporations,e-commercecompanies, technology platforms, andfranchisebusinesses, which enjoy biggereconomies of scale, greater access to capital for investments, larger advertising budgets, higher brand awareness, and greater access to talent pools for hiring. This collectively giveslarger players an edge over mom-and-pop businesses, which frequently lose ground and find themselves driven out of business when forced to compete.\n\nFortunately, there are signs of hope for mom-and-pop stores. More than ever before, consumers are demanding more-personalized products and services.

Small businesses can expand their\u00a0target audience and broaden their geographical reach through the use of e-commerce and social media.\n\nMom-and-pop shops also benefit from a phenomenon known as \u201cSmall Business Saturday,\u201d which was founded by American Express in 2010 and is cosponsored by theU.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The idea was to encourage shopping locally on the Saturday following Thanksgiving, and it appears to have worked.

Mom-and-pop business owners tend to have a vested interest in the community, its citizens, and the local economy.\u00a0Consequently, they offer highly interactive and personalized services that large corporations cannot replicate.\u00a0For this reason mom-and-pop stores often win increasedbrand loyaltyamong consumers.\n\nMom-and-pop drugstores are typically owned and operated by the same family for generations, where the druggist or pharmacist would also be the proprietor of the store.\n\n\u201cMom-and-pop\u201d is also used to refer to inexperienced investors who minimally invest in the stock market. Despite limited capital commitments, mom-and-pop investors often count on significant returns on their trades in order to supplement their income.\n\nHowever, many mom-and-pop investors areunfamiliar with market researchand so react impulsively to market changes and fluctuations. They rashly dump their positions rather than riding out rough patches. Some mom-and-pop investors combat their inexperience by hiring brokers to facilitate trades or using one of the many online trading\u00a0platforms to place their investments.\n\nNational Mom and Pop Business Owners Day is March 29.The holiday was founded by Rick and Margie Segel in 1939 as a way to honor the hat shop started by their parents that year.\n\nA mom-and-pop store is a small, often family-owned-and-operated business that maximizes its profits by providing personalized, interactive services for its customers, curating its inventory to fit a local need.
