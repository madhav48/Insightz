  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.\n\nThe technology sector offers a wide range of products and services for both customers and other businesses.Consumer goodslike personal computers, mobile devices, wearable technology, home appliances,\u00a0televisions, and so on are continually being improved and sold to consumers with new features.\n\nOn the business side, companies are dependent on innovations coming out of the technology sector to create theirenterprise\u00a0software, manage theirlogistics systems, protect their databases, and generally provide the critical information and services\u00a0that allow companies to make strategic business decisions. The term \"technology sector\" is frequently shortened to tech sector and is used interchangeably with the term \"technology industry or tech industry.\"\n\nThe technology sector is often the most attractive investment destination in any economy. The U.S. technology sector boasts of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix, IBM, and Microsoft. These companies drive the growth in the tech sector, and the enthusiasm around their long-term potential has them trading atprice-to-earnings multiplesthat look ridiculous compared to almost every other sector.\n\nA large amount of this growth owes a debt to the buzz factor that technology companies create by launching business lines that have never existed before.\n\nThe term technology sector has been broadened many times to include businesses that may be better served by a more specific category. The technology sector was initially anchored in semiconductors, computing hardware, and communications equipment. In addition, growth also includes jobs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in computer and information technology are poised to grow 13% between 2020 and 2030.\n\nThe addition ofsoftware companiesexpanded the perceived tech sector to include anything based on coding. Soon, more room had to be made for internet companies, which flooded during the Internet boom. Some of these internet companies were media and content companies that used code as the medium. Still, others were off launching rich features that grew to bee-commerce, social media, the sharing economy, and evencloud-based computing.\n\nThe technology sector now includes such a diverse set of companies that the subsectors are far more useful than the overall one. Unsurprisingly, there is no universal agreement\u2014some pundits want a whole new sector for each innovation\u2014but the big buckets include semiconductors, software, networking, Internet, and hardware.\n\nFrom there, all the subsectors\u00a0can be further broken down. For example, hardware breaks into wearables, peripherals, laptops, desktops, and so on. People may argue that it doesn't make sense to call a cloud computing company a software company, but the arbitrary separations are a bit more manageable than the massive label of \"tech sector\" for every company.\n\nIn general, an industry is a group of companies that are all similar in type. A sector is a segment of the broader economy. For example, the semiconductor industry is part of the technology sector. However, these terms are often used interchangeably.\n\nThere are three main industries within the technology sector. These are software and services, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware and equipment. Each of these areas can be further broken down into sub-industries.\n\nSocial media is an industry within the technology sector. Some of the most well-known tech companies are those that run social media platforms, such as Meta and X. Many of these tech companies pursue other projects in addition to social media, so they can belong to other industries within the technology sector as well.\n\nThe technology sector is the part of the economy made up of businesses that focus on electronics, software, computers, social media, and other industries related to information technology. These companies often invest in developing new projects with future potential, even without an immediate payoff.\n\nMany parts of the public and private sectors rely on products and services developed by technology companies. The tech sector is often a growth part of the economy.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Occupational Handbook: Computer and Information Technology Occupations.\"",
