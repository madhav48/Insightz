  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nRecapitalization is the process of restructuring a company\u2019s debt and equity mixture, often to stabilize a company\u2019s capital structure.\n\nThe process mainly involves the exchange of one form of financing for another, such as removingpreferred sharesfrom the company\u2019s capital structure and replacing them withbonds.\n\nRecapitalization is a strategy that a company can use to improve its financial stability or overhaul its financial structure. To accomplish this, the company must change itsdebt-to-equity (D/E) ratioby adding more debt or more equity to itscapital. There are many reasons why a company may consider recapitalization, including:\n\nWhen a company\u2019s debt decreases in proportion to its equity, it has lessleverage. Itsearnings per share (EPS)should decrease following the change. But its shares would be incrementally less risky since the company has fewer debt obligations, which requireinterestpayments and return ofprincipalupon maturity. Without the requirements of debt, the company can return more of its profits and cash to shareholders.\n\nSeveral factors motivate a company to recapitalize. A company may decide to use it as a strategy to defend itself against ahostile takeover. The target company\u2019s management may decide to issue more debt to make it less attractive to the potential acquirer.\n\nAnother reason may be to reduce its financial obligations. Higher debt levels compared with equity means higher interest payments. Bytrading in debt for equity, the company can reduce the level of debt and, therefore, the amount of interest it pays to its creditors. This, in turn, improves the company\u2019s overall financial well-being.\n\nFurthermore, recapitalization is a viable strategy to help keep share prices from dropping. If a company finds that its shares are declining in value, it may decide to swap equity for debt to push the stock price back up.\n\nSome companies may also use recapitalization to minimize their tax payments, implement anexit strategyfor venture capitalists, or reorganize themselves during a bankruptcy. Companies often use this as a way to diversify their debt-to-equity ratio to improveliquidity.\n\nCompanies can swap debt for equity or vice versa for many reasons. An example of equity replacing debt in the capital structure is when a company issues stock to buy backdebt securities, increasing its proportion of equity capital compared with its debt capital. This is called an equity recapitalization.\n\nDebt investors require routine payments and a return of principal upon maturity, so a swap of debt for equity helps a company maintain its cash and use the cash generated from operations for business purposes, reinvestment, or capital returns to equity holders.\n\nOn the other hand, a company may issue debt and use the cash to buy back shares or issuedividends, effectively recapitalizing the company by increasing the proportion of debt in the capital structure. Another benefit of taking on more debt is that interest payments are tax deductible, while dividends are not. By paying interest on debt securities, a company can decrease its tax bill and increase the amount of capital returned in total to both debt and equity investors.\n\nGovernments may buy back shares to get a controlling interest in a company important to a nation\u2019s economy throughnationalization\u2014another form of recapitalization.\n\nGovernments also partake in the mass recapitalization of their countries\u2019 banking sectors during times of financial crisis and when the solvency and liquidity of banks and the greater financial system come into question. For example, the U.S. government recapitalized the country\u2019s banking sector with various forms of equity to keep the banks and the financial system solvent and maintain liquidity through theTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)in 2008.\n\nA company can use recapitalization to improve its financial stability or overhaul its financial structure. The company must change its debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio by adding more debt or more equity to its capital.\n\nReasons include a drop in the business\u2019s share price; to defend against a hostile takeover; to reduce financial obligations and minimize taxes; to provide venture capitalists with an exit strategy; or bankruptcy.\n\nCompanies can swap debt for equity, or vice versa.\n\nOne version of equity replacing debt in the capital structure is equity recapitalization. This is when a company issues stock to buy back debt securities, increasing its proportion of equity capital compared with its debt capital.\n\nOne version of debt replacing equity in the capital structure is when a company issues debt and uses the cash to buy back shares or issue dividends. The business thus recapitalizes by increasing the proportion of debt in the capital structure.\n\nRecapitalization is restructuring a business\u2019s debt and equity mixture. The purpose is to stabilize a company\u2019s capital structure. It mainly involves exchanging one financing form for another.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \u201cTroubled Asset Relief Program (TARP): TARP Programs.\u201d",
