  "definition": "Quantum computing is an area of computer science that uses the principles of quantum theory. Quantum theory explains the behavior of energy and material on the atomic and subatomic levels.\n\nQuantum computing uses subatomic particles, such as electrons or photons. Quantum bits, or qubits, allow these particles to exist in more than one state (i.e., 1 and 0) at the same time.\n\nTheoretically, linked qubits can \"exploit the interference between their wave-like quantum states to perform calculations that might otherwise take millions of years.\"\n\nClassical computers today employ a stream of electrical impulses (1 and 0) in a binary manner to encode information in bits. This restricts their processing ability, compared to quantum computing.\n\nThe field of quantum computing emerged in the 1980s. It was discovered that certain computational problems could be tackled more efficiently with quantum algorithms than with their classical counterparts.\n\nQuantum computing has the capability to sift through huge numbers of possibilities and extract potential solutions to complex problems and challenges. Where classical computers store information as bits with either 0s or 1s, quantum computers use qubits. Qubits carry information in a quantum state that engages 0 and 1 in a multidimensional way.\n\nSuch massive computing potential and the projected market size for its use have attracted the attention of some of the most prominent companies.These include IBM, Microsoft, Google, D-Waves Systems, Alibaba, Nokia, Intel, Airbus, HP, Toshiba, Mitsubishi, SK Telecom, NEC, Raytheon, Lockheed Martin, Rigetti, Biogen, Volkswagen, and Amgen.\n\nQuantum computing could contribute greatly to the fields of security,finance, military affairs and intelligence, drug design and discovery, aerospace designing, utilities (nuclear fusion), polymer design,machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI),Big Datasearch, and digital manufacturing.\n\nQuantum computers could be used to improve the secure sharing of information. Or to improve radars and their ability to detect missiles and aircraft. Another area where quantum computing is expected to help is the environment and keeping water clean with chemical sensors.\n\nHere are some potential benefits of quantum computing:\n\nPercentage of large companies planing to create initiatives around quantum computing by 2025, according to research by Gartner.\n\nSuperposition and entanglement are two features of quantum physics on which quantum computing is based. They empower quantum computers to handle operations at speeds exponentially higher than conventional computers and with much less energy consumption.\n\nAccording to IBM, \u00a0it's what a qubit can do rather than what it is that's remarkable. A qubit places the quantum information that it contains into a state of superposition. This refers to a combination of all possible configurations of the qubit. \"Groups of qubits in superposition can create complex, multidimensional computational spaces. Complex problems can be represented in new ways in these spaces.\"\n\nEntanglement is integral to quantum computing power. Pairs of qubits can be made to become entangled. This means that the two qubits then exist in a single state. In such a state, changing one qubit directly affects the other in a manner that's predictable.\n\nQuantum algorithms are designed to take advantage of this relationship to solve complex problems. While doubling the number of bits in a classical computer doubles its processing power, adding qubits results in an exponential upswing in computing power and ability.\n\nDecoherence occurs when the quantum behavior of qubits decays. The quantum state can be disturbed instantly by vibrations or temperature changes. This can cause qubits to fall out of superposition and cause errors to appear in computing. It's important that qubits be protected from such interference by, for instance, supercooled refridgerators, insulation, and vacuum chambers.\n\nQuantum computing offers enormous potential for developments and problem-solving in many industries. However, currently, it has its limitations.\n\nAccording to global energy leader Iberdola, \"quantum computers must have almost no atmospheric pressure, an ambient temperature close to absolute zero (-273\u00b0C) and insulation from the earth's magnetic field\u00a0to prevent the atoms from moving, colliding with each other, or interacting with the environment.\"\n\n\"In addition, these systems only operate for very short intervals of time, so that the information becomes damaged and cannot be stored, making it even more difficult to recover the data.\"\n\nQuantum computers have a more basic structure than classical computers. They have no memory or processor.\u00a0All a quantum computer uses is a set of superconducting qubits.\n\nQuantum computers and classical computers process information differently. A quantum computer uses qubits to run multidimensional quantum algorithms. Their processing power increases exponentially as qubits are added. A classical processor uses bits to operate various programs. Their power increases linearly as more bits are added. Classical computers have much less computing power.\n\nClassical computers are best for everyday tasks and have low error rates. Quantum computers are ideal for a higher level of task, e.g., running simulations, analyzing data (such as for chemical or drug trials), creating energy-efficient batteries. They can also have high error rates.\n\nClassical computers don't need extra-special care. They may use a basic internal fan to keep from overheating. Quantum processors need to be protected from the slightest vibrations and must be kept extremely cold. Super-cooled superfluids must be used for that purpose.\n\nQuantum computers are more expensive and difficult to build than classical computers.\n\nIn 2019, Google demonstrated a quantum computer that can solve a problem in minutes that would take a classical computer 10,000 years.\n\nGoogle is spending billions of dollars to build its quantum computer by 2029. The company opened a campus in California called Google AI to help it meet this goal. Once developed, Google could launch a quantum computing service via the cloud.\n\nIBM plans to have a 1,000-qubit quantum computer in place by 2023. For now, IBM allows access to its machines for those research organizations, universities, and laboratories that are part of its Quantum Network.\n\nMicrosoft offers companies access to quantum technology via the Azure Quantum platform.\n\nThere\u2019s interest in quantum computing and its technology from financial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase and Visa.\n\nQuantum computing relates to computing made by a quantum computer.\u00a0Compared to traditional computing done by a classical computer, a quantum computer should be able to store much more information and operate with more efficient algorithms. This translates to solving extremely complex tasks faster.\n\nBuilding a quantum computer takes a long time and is vastly expensive. Google has been working on building a quantum computer for years and has spent billions of dollars. It expects to have its quantum computer ready by 2029.In November 2022, Google announced a 433-qubit system, followed a year later by IBM announcing its Condor, a 1,121 superconducting qubit quantum processor. At that time, IBM put out its 2033 roadmap, saying it was aiming at Blue Jay, a system capable of executing one billion gates across 2,000 qubits by 2033.\n\nA quantum computer cost billions to build. However, in 2020, China-based Shenzhen SpinQ Technology planned to sell a $5,000 desktop quantum computer to consumers for schools and colleges. The previous year, it had began selling a quantum computer for $50,000.\n\nA quantum computer is many times faster than a classical computer or a supercomputer. Google\u2019s quantum computer in development, Sycamore, is said to have performed a calculation in 200 seconds, compared to the 10,000 years that one of the world\u2019s fastest computers, IBM's Summit, would take to solve it.IBM disputed Google's claim, saying its supercomputer could solve the calculation in 2.5 days. Even so, that's 1,000 times slower than Google's quantum machine.\n\nQuantum computing is very different from classical computing. It uses qubits, which can be 1 or 0 at the same time. Classical computers use bits, which can only be 1 or 0.\n\nAs a result, quantum computing is much faster and more powerful. It is expected to be used to solve a variety of extremely complex, worthwhile tasks.\n\nWhile it has its limitations at this time, it is poised to be put to work by many high-powered companies in myriad industries.\n\nScientific American. \"Google Publishes Landmark Quantum Supremacy Claim.\"\n\nScience Museum. \"Quantum Computing: What, Who, How and When?\"\n\nQuantum Insider. \"Quantum Computing Companies.\"\n\nUniversity of Waterloo. \u201cThe Future Is Quantum.\u201d\n\nIberdrola. \"Quantum Computing and Supercomputers Will Revolutionise Technology.\"\n\nGartner. \"Gartner IT Symposium/Xpo 2021 Americas: Day 2 Highlights.\"\n\nIBM. \"What is Quantum Computing?\"\n\nMIT Technology Review. \"Explainer: What is a Quantum Computer?\"\n\nTechTarget. \"Quantum Computing.\"\n\nCB Insights. \u201cQuantum Computing vs. Classical Computing in One Graphic.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal. \u201cGoogle Aims for Commercial-Grade Quantum Computer by 2029.\u201d\n\nNature. \u201cHow to Get Started in Quantum Computing.\u201d\n\nJP Morgan Chase. \"Global Technology Applied Research.\"\n\nVisa Research. \"Research Areas.\"\n\nIBM. \"The Hardware and Software for the Era of Quantum Utility Is Here.\"\n\nGoogle. \"Our Progress Toward Quantum Error Correction.\"\n\nDiscover. \"A Desktop Quantum Computer For Just $5,000.\"\n\nMedium. \"Google\u2019s Quantum Computer Is About 158 Million Times Faster Than the World\u2019s Fastest Supercomputer.\"",
