  "term": "What Is Market Saturation?",
  "definition": "Market saturation arises when the demand for a product or service in a marketplace has been maximized.\n\nWhen market saturation occurs, a company can achieve further growth with product changes that reignite consumer demand or by taking existingmarket sharefrom competitors.\n\nMarket saturation can bemicroeconomic or macroeconomic. From a micro perspective, market saturation can take place when a specific market no longer exhibits consumer demand for a company's product.\n\nThis occurs when a company's competition is able to attract more buyers to its similar products by, for instance, underscoring differences through advertising or lowering prices. It can also happen when a competitor's product innovation reduces consumer desire and need for the company's product or service.\n\nFrom a macro perspective, market saturation occurs when an entire customer base has been serviced and the company cannot acquire new customers.\n\nTo inhibit or prevent market saturation, many companies design their products to wear down and require replacement at some point. For example, Apple encourages consumers to replace older iPhone models with new models.\n\nMarket saturation can force companies to change theirrevenuemodels, especially when product sales slow. For example, IBM started providing recurring services once it experienced saturation in the large computer server market.\n\nWhen a company faces a saturatedmarket, its product or service has to be more innovative than those of its competitors to entice customers to buy it.\n\nA company might pivot to become the low-cost provider of a product or service. Or, it may decide to position its offering as a premium option.\n\nA company also may choose to diversify its product line, so that when sales for one product drop, stable or increasing sales of another can offset losses.\n\nCompanies must be competitive in pricing products to compete against other companies that choose the same pricing structure. However, companies that operate in a saturated market might end up wagingprice warswith each other, continuously undercutting prices to attract customers. This can lead to a race to the bottom.\n\nWhen a market is saturated with product and service options, especially when those options are somewhat homogeneous, effective marketing strategies can make a difference for a company.\n\nA company can test different messages and then use the one that had the greatest positive response.\n\nConsistent, ongoing marketing and advertising, especially with the help of various social media platforms and influencers, can revitalize interest in products and drive fresh sales for prolonged periods.\n\nFads or Trends:Fads or trendscan supercharge demand for particular products or services that may have experienced slow sales. This is particularly true in the age of social media when consumer excitement can be spread instantly to thousands of people, if not more.\n\nHowever, over time (or potentially quickly due to adverse reactions shared online), market saturation can take effect as consumer interest wanes and purchases die out.\n\nReal Estate:It can be challenging for arealtorto operate in a saturated market. Residential real estate markets ebb and flow depending on many factors. These can include prices, economic conditions, and inventory.\n\nWhen the market is saturated, it often causes a drop in house prices, and in turn, a hit for realtors' incomes which rely on a commission. However, that can be a boon for consumers trying to buy a home.\n\nNew rules for the National Association of Realtors that took effect in 2024 lowered commissions for home buyers and sellers. The standard 6% commission no longer applies and sellers don't have to offer compensation to the agents of buyers. NAR also requires brokers to enter into written agreements with their buyers. They should help consumers understand what services will be provided, and at what cost.\n\nA saturated market often includes a handful of major suppliers who all sell a specific product or products and have potentially low-profit margins. You'll also know that a market may be saturated if few new companies participate in it.\n\nOne way it's measured is bycalculating market share. Consider an industry's total sales. Then divide an individual company's total sales by that figure. Subtract that percentage from 100 to see the market share available to be captured. If the individual company has a large percentage, and it has a number of competitors (who presumably also have some market share), then the market may be saturated. In addition, researching supply versus demand for a product or service can help you get some idea of market saturation.\n\nCreative, consistent messaging and marketing, lower pricing, and exemplary customer service can help companies overcome saturation. They also might enter a niche market within the saturated market to boost sales.\n\nWhen the demand for a product or service peaks, market saturation occurs. Sales stagnate and companies can run into financial trouble.\n\nCompanies can combat market saturation and its negative effect on their operations by lowering prices, cutting their expenses, developing similar, more innovative products, and diversifying into additional products.\n\nDatamation. \"How IBM Has Changed To Become What It Once Was.\"\n\nFirst Citizens Wealth. \"Impacts of the 2024 Real Estate Commission Changes.\"\n\nCNN. \"The 6% Commission on Buying or Selling a Home Is Gone After Realtors Association Agrees to Seismic Settlement.\"\n\nNational Association of Realtors. \"National Association of REALTORS\u00ae Reaches Agreement To Resolve Nationwide Claims Brought by Home Sellers.\"\n\nNebraska Business Development Center. \"Saturation Points\u2014Know Your Market Before You Make It To Your Market.\"",
