  "definition": "Logistics refers to the overall process of managing how resources are acquired, stored, and transported to their final destination. Logistics management involves identifying prospective distributors and suppliers and determining their effectiveness and accessibility. Logistics managers are referred to as logisticians.\n\n\u201cLogistics\u201d was initially a military-based term used in reference to how military personnel obtained, stored, and moved equipment and supplies. The term is now used widely in the business sector, particularly by companies in the manufacturing sector, to refer to how resources are handled and moved along thesupply chain.\n\nIn simple terms, the goal of logistics management is to have the right amount of a resource or input at the right time, get it to the appropriate location in proper condition, and deliver it to the correct internal or external customer.\n\nFor example, in thenatural gas industry, logistics involves managing the pipelines, trucks, storage facilities, and distribution centers that handle oil as it is transformed along the supply chain. An efficient supply chain and effective logistical procedures are essential to reduce costs and to maintain and increase efficiency. Poor logistics leads to untimely deliveries, failure to meet the needs of clientele, and ultimately causes the business to suffer.\n\nThe concept of business logistics has been transformed since the 1960s. The increasingintricacy of supplying companieswith the materials and resources they need, along with the global expansion of supply chains, has led to a need for specialists known as supply chain logisticians.\n\nIn the modern era, the technology boom and the complexity of logistics processes have spawned logistics management software and specialized logistics-focused firms that expedite the movement of resources along the supply chain.\n\nManufacturing companies may choose to outsource the management of their logistics to specialists or manage logistics internally if it is cost-effective to do so.\n\nOne reason why large online retailers like Amazon have come to dominate the retail landscape is the overall innovation and efficiency of their logistics along every link of the supply chain.\n\nThe tasks for which a logistician is responsible vary depending on the business. Primary responsibilities include overseeing and managing inventory byarranging for appropriate transportationand adequate storage for the inventory.\n\nA qualified logistician plans out the logistics process and coordinates the steps as inventory and resources move along the supply chain.\n\nSpecialized training in supply chain management and logistics often includes core or elective courses, or even discrete programs of study, in business education. A business degree that emphasizes these skills\u2014or in some cases, a technical degree in systems analysis or database management\u2014is usually necessary to begin what is often a well-paid career as a logistician.\n\nIn business, logistics is the process of transporting and storing raw materials, finished goods, inventory, and other resources. Logistics in a business is typically made up of many components, including customer service, demand forecasting, warehousing, material handling, inventory control, order processing, and transportation.\n\nLogistics is critical to a company\u2019sbottom line. It enables the movement of materials or goods, the satisfaction of contracts, and the fulfillment of services. Effective logistics management ensures smooth movement along the supply chain and can provide a competitive advantage.\n\nCareers in logistics can include truck drivers, customer service representatives, dispatchers, freight agents, supply chain managers, transportation analysts, procurement managers, logisticians, and operations managers, among others. A degree in logistics or business administration will be helpful for many roles in logistics\u2014including logistician, a career that is expected to grow much faster than average.\n\nWhen a company optimizes its logistics, it improves efficiency along all points of the supply chain. Understanding how to get the right resource to the right place at the right time can be a differentiator for a business, adding value to the customer while at the same time cutting costs and boosting the bottom line.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Logisticians: What They Do.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Logisticians: How to Become One.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Logisticians: Summary.\u201d",
