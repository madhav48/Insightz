  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA renewable resource is a resource that can be replenished naturally over time. As a result, it is sustainable despite its consumption by humankind.\n\nRenewable resources for the production of energy are considered especially important for their potential to replace nonrenewable, or finite, resources. Additionally, renewable resources can offer cleaner energy solutions than those provided by nonrenewable resources such as coal and fossil fuels.\n\nExamples of renewable resources include the sun, wind, water, the Earth\u2019s heat (geothermal), and biomass.\n\nA renewable resource is a resource of which there is a seemingly endless supply because it can be replenished. For example, renewable resources such as the sun, the wind, and geothermal heat are considered inexhaustible.\n\nWater is also considered a renewable natural resource, as long as there is precipitation. Changing climate patterns have underscored the need for conservation efforts to protect water supplies.\n\nOther natural resources are considered renewable even though some time and effort must go into their renewal. In addition, most precious metals are considered renewable because they\u2019re reusable. Since they are not destroyed during their extraction and use, they can be recycled.\n\nUnlike renewable resources, once a nonrenewable resource is depleted, it cannot be recovered. As the human population continues to grow and finite resources become increasingly scarce, the demand for renewable resources increases.\n\nRenewable energy sources include wind power, solar power, hydroelectric power, bioenergy, and geothermal energy.\n\nFossil fuels have been used since the late 1880s to produce the energy we use. Renewable resources such as hydropower and wood have been used much longer. In fact, they were the two primary renewable energy resources up to the 1990s.\n\nIn the years since, renewable energy production has come increasingly from biomass, geothermal, solar, water, and wind resources.\n\nRenewable resources that can replace fossil fuels in the production of energy are a major focus of nations around the world. The challenges for successful renewable energy production include reliability and expense.\n\nA great deal of research is taking place to determine the viability and best implementation of renewable energy on a mass scale.\n\nTheParis Climate Accordis an agreement involving over 180 countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit the global temperature increase to less than two degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by the year 2100. On Jan. 20, 2021, then-President Joe Biden signed an executive order for the United States to rejoin the Paris Agreement after Donald Trump\u2019s first presidential administration withdrew from it on Nov. 4, 2020.Trump returned to office in January 2025 and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Agreement again.\n\nSunlight is a widely recognized renewable resource. In fact, it has been used throughout human history to warm shelters, dry and cook foods, and heat water. Different technologies exist and continue to be developed to collect and convert solar radiation into heat energy that can be used for various purposes.\n\nFor example, solar photovoltaic (PV) devices, or solar cells, change sunlight into electricity. Depending on the number of solar cells in use, they can power small appliances or provide electricity for many homes.\n\nThe challenge with using sunlight for our energy needs is that it can vary and, at times, be unreliable. The availability of sunlight depends on the time of day, existing weather conditions, season of the year, and geographic location.\n\nWind has a direct relationship to the sun. Daily winds result when the sun\u2019s heat is captured unevenly by the varying surfaces on the Earth, including oceans and other water masses. Air above land heats up faster than air above water during the day when the sun is shining. That warm air expands and rises. Cooler air takes its place. This creates wind.\n\nIn earlier years, windmills were used across the United States to capture energy and pump water from wells. They still exist in some farming areas to provide livestock with water.\n\nToday, wind is harnessed to produce electricity. Wind flows over blades in wind turbines. The blades turn, and that drives an electric generator. In turn, that generates electricity.\n\nTypically, wind turbines don\u2019t produce emissions capable of polluting the air or water. Also, they don\u2019t need to be cooled by water.\u00a0Though rare, they can have some negative effects on the environment if they leak lubricating fluids or catch fire. They can also negatively impact bird life and species.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent annual data available), wind turbines provided about 10.2% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation.\n\nHydropower is the energy produced by water. It was an early renewable source of energy even before it was used to generate electricity. For example, hydropower turned paddle wheels on rivers to allow for the milling of grain and lumber. However, changes in precipitation and lack of water due to droughts can affect hydropower production.\n\nHydropower was used to generate electricity in the U.S. beginning in 1880. Today, most of the nation\u2019s hydroelectricity is produced in facilities located at large dams built in the 1970s.\n\nUntil 2019, hydropower was the largest source of total annual renewable electricity generation in the U.S.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent annual data available), hydropower accounted for 5.7% of total utility-scale electricity generation.\n\nGeothermal is a renewable resource that uses Earth\u2019s heat to generate power. Hot springs heated by the Earth have been used for centuries for bathing. Geothermal energy has also been used, and still is, for district heating systems.\n\nGeothermal energy is used to generate electricity as well. Power plants for this purpose are built below ground, within approximately a mile of Earth\u2019s surface.\n\nSeven U.S. states had geothermal power plants as of February 2024: California, Hawaii, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Utah. In 2023 (the most recent annual data available), they produced approximately 17 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent annual data available), geothermal accounted for about 0.4% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation.\n\nGeothermal heat pumps are another way to use Earth\u2019s heat. They transfer heat from the ground (or water) into buildings during the winter and reverse the process in the summer to aid in heating and cooling.\n\nRenewable organic products that produce energy are referred to as biomass. The process of photosynthesis uses energy from the sun to convert biomass resources into chemical energy.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent annual data available), biomass provided\u00a0nearly five quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) and about 5% of total primary energy use in the United States. In the same year, it accounted for about 1.1% of total U.S. utility-scale electricity generation.\n\nBiomass renewable resources include wood and wood waste, agricultural crops and waste (which are mainly used for biofuel), municipal waste including paper, cotton, food, and yard waste, and animal manure and sewage.\n\nBiofuel refers to liquid fuels and blending components produced from feedstock biomass materials. Mostbiofuelsare used as transportation fuels, but they may also be used for heating and electricity generation. This renewable resource has become more prevalent in recent years as an alternative to nonrenewable resources such as coal, oil, and natural gas.\n\nIn January 2024, U.S. biofuels production capacity was about 24 billion gallons, an increase over the same period in 2023. In addition, the U.S. was a net exporter of biofuels. The fuel ethanol accounted for most of biofuel production and increased 2% in production capacity over 2023.\n\nAlthough prices are still high for biofuel, some experts project that as the prices of fossil fuels increase, the price of biofuel will become more competitive.\n\nRenewable resources are those resources that can continue to exist despite being consumed or can replenish themselves over a period of time even as they are used. They include sun, wind, water, geothermal, and biomass.\n\nThe disadvantage of renewable resources is that they may not be available for use when needed.\n\nFor example, the ability to collect and use solar energy is limited at night and when the sky is overcast. The continued availability of water depends on ongoing precipitation and weather conditions.\n\nRenewable resources are considered to have less of a negative impact on the environment than nonrenewable resources.\n\nNonrenewable resources are those resources that are considered finite due to the extremely long time it takes for nature to create them. Once depleted, they become unavailable. They include coal, natural gas, and oil.\n\nThe advantage of nonrenewable resources is that they\u2019re readily available now and theinfrastructurefor their use exists to produce power on demand.\n\nHowever, they have a greater negative environmental impact than renewable resources. The heat trapped by carbon dioxide gas when coal and oil are burned contributes to the atmosphere\u2019s rising temperature and global climate change.\n\nActivists, consumers, and government leaders promote renewable energy as a way to generate needed power without the emissions that are warming the planet and threatening life on Earth.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic supported the trend toward lower fossil fuel prices due to record-low consumption in 2020.However, with the outbreak of the Ukraine-Russia war in early 2022, the price of oil skyrocketed and remained high going into 2024 before falling.\n\nRenewable resources have become a focal point of the environmental movement, both politically and economically. Energy obtained from renewable resources puts much less strain on the limited supply of fossil fuels, which are nonrenewable resources.\n\nThe problem with using renewable resources on a large scale is that they are costly. In most cases, more research is needed to determine how to use them most cost-effectively.\n\nBeyond their limited supply, energy sources such as fossil fuels damage the environment when produced and consumed, and they contribute to global warming.\n\nThe first major international accord to curb carbon dioxide emissions and global warming was theKyoto Protocol, signed in 1997.More recently, global powers met in Paris in 2015 to pledge emissions reductions and a focus on higher reliance on renewable resources for energy.\n\nIncentives can encourage the use of alternative energy. For example, energy taxes place a surcharge on fossil fuels. This can make the prices of renewable resources more competitive and attractive. As a result, people may be more inclined to use renewable energy. Also, the reward ofrenewable energy certificates (RECs)acts as an incentive to produce energy using green sources.\n\nGreen funds, which are investments such as mutual funds, support eco-friendly and sustainable companies by investing in them. These investments also help to promote environmental awareness.\n\nThese incentives seem to be having an effect. According to the U.S.Energy Information Administration (EIA), in 2023 (the most recent annual data available), renewable energy provided almost 8.25 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu). This represented 9% of total U.S. energy consumption.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent annual data available), 21.4% of U.S.\u00a0utility-scale electricity was generated\u00a0by renewable energy sources.\n\nState and federal governments have encouraged more biofuel consumption with requirements andincentives for the use of renewable energy. The EIA anticipates that U.S. renewable energy consumption will continue to increase through 2050.\n\nThe term \u201crenewable resource\u201d refers to a resource that replenishes itself naturally over a span of time. It can be used without worry that it will be depleted permanently. Renewable resources are of particular interest as sources of renewable energy.\n\nThe wind is one example. So are the sun and water. Biomass is a source of renewable energy from plants and animals. It includes wood, agricultural crops, food waste, and animal manure.\n\nEnergy taxes place a surcharge on fossil fuels. The hope is that the prices of energy options produced by renewable resources will become more attractive and encourage consumer interest. Green mutual funds support eco-friendly and sustainable companies by investing in them and helping to promote environmental awareness.\n\nThe Kyoto Protocol is an international agreement to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. The essential tenet of the Kyoto Protocol is that industrialized nations need to lessen the amount of their CO2 emissions. The protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, when greenhouse gases were rapidly threatening our climate, life on Earth, and the planet itself.\n\nIt was followed by the Paris Climate Accord, a 2015 agreement involving over 180 countries to reduce GHG emissions and limit the global temperature increase to less than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels by the year 2100.\n\nRenewable resources include the sun, the wind, water, Earth\u2019s heat (geothermal), and biomass.\n\nRenewable resources are natural resources that replenish themselves or exist on a continual basis. In recent years, they have been of special interest for the vital role they can play in the production of energy. They\u2019re also seen as having less of a negative impact on the environment.\n\nOf course, renewable resources were used for thousands of years before nonrenewable resources such as coal and oil began to be used extensively in the late 19th century.\n\nDue to the finite nature of coal and oil, plus the threat from climate change, the world community is focused on the greater use of renewable resources to meet energy needs.\n\nThe White House, Biden Administration Archives. \u201cParis Climate Agreement.\u201d\n\nNPR. \u201cTrump Is Withdrawing from the Paris Agreement (Again), Reversing U.S. Climate Policy.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cSolar Explained.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cWind Explained: Wind Energy and the Environment.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs): What Is U.S. Electricity Generation by Energy Source?\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cGeothermal Explained: Use of Geothermal Energy.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cTotal Energy: Primary Energy Consumption by Source.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cBiomass Explained.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cBiofuels Explained.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cU.S. Capacity to Produce Biofuels Increased 7% in 2023.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cU.S. Fuel Ethanol Exports Rise on Strong International Demand and Low U.S. Prices.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cFrom the Barrel to the Pump: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Prices for Petroleum Products.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cShort-Term Energy Outlook.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cBrent Crude Oil Prices Traded in a Narrow Range in 2024.\u201d\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change. \u201cWhat Is the Kyoto Protocol?\u201d\n\nUnited Nations Climate Change, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cParis Climate Change Conference\u2014November 2015.\u201d\n\nU.S. Energy Information Administration. \u201cRenewable Energy Explained.\u201d",
