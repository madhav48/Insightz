  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nVisual Basic for Applications (VBA) is a programming language embedded in Microsoft Office that can be used to automate processes and build functions.\n\nVisual Basic for Applications (VBA) is used to write programs for Microsoft Office (MS Office, Office) applications, including Access, Excel, PowerPoint, Publisher, Word, and Visio.\n\nVBA allows users to customize beyond what's normally available with MS Office host applications.\n\nVBA is an event-driven tool. You can use it to tell the computer to initiate an action or string of actions by typing commands into an editing module to build custom macroinstructions (macros).\n\nA macro is essentially a sequence of inputs that result in a sequence of outputs. This accomplishes specific computing tasks. You don't have to purchase the VBA software because VBA ships with Microsoft Office.\n\nVBA allows users to manipulate graphical user interface (GUI) features such as toolbars, menus, dialogue boxes, and forms. You can use VBA to create user-defined functions (UDFs), access\u00a0Windowsapplication programming interfaces (APIs),\u00a0and automate specific computer processes and calculations.\n\nMicrosoft hosts variouslearning opportunitiesfor entry-level developers to gain modest experience working with VBA.\n\nAll Office suite programs share common programming languages, and each is capable of integrating VBA code to enhance it. VBA has been a natural fit with Excel, more so than with other Office suite programs, because of the repetitive nature of spreadsheets,data analytics, and organizing data.\n\nThe root of the relationship between VBA and Excel is often tied to using macros. You can use VBA to run a macro in Excel, but you can also use it for non-macro activities.\n\nSimply press Alt + F11 to access VBA in Excel.Your existing Excel workbook will remain running, but a new window will appear for Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. The top left of the VBA window will show the current projects. The InvestopediaProject file is ready to receive VBA code in this example:\n\nThe window displays the properties of the selected project at the bottom left. Properties are listed as projects or workbooks are selected. These properties are listed alphabetically by default, although they can be sorted by category.\n\nA new window appears when you double-click on a project on the top left. There's no information in this area, but you'll see two dropdowns that say \"(General)\" and \"(Declarations).\" VBA code is directly entered into this coding window.\n\nHere's an example of a VBA code that's been entered:\n\nMany important buttons and tools appear on the toolbar. The items highlighted in yellow are the run, break, and reset toggles for the VBA code. The run button executes the code. The break button pauses the code activity. The reset stops the execution of the code and brings the process back to the starting position of the code.\n\nFinancial modeling is about manipulating huge amounts of data, and VBA is endemic to thefinancial services sector. It's likely running within applications you use each day if you work in finance, if you're not aware of it. Some jobs in the industry require prior knowledge of VBA, others don't. You can:\n\nMany online forums provide VBA code that allows you to simply copy and paste the code for your personal use. Be cautious when using someone else's code, especially if you're unfamiliar with the source, the individual, or the logic of the code.\n\nA module is where Excel stores the VBA code. Information regarding the modules within a spreadsheet can be found in Project Explorer, one of the sections of the Visual Basic Editor. All modules can be saved within a modules folder. Modules are sometimes referred to as standard modules.\n\nMost code is used to manipulate objects in VBA. Objects are items such as workbooks, worksheets, cells, cell ranges, or cell fonts. Objects are often selected or referred to as part of the code when you're coding in VBA. The code can use the \"ActiveCell\" language to manipulate the object currently selected in the spreadsheet. You can also create a process that executes when abar chartis edited.\n\nThe procedure is the part of a computer program that performs a specific task. It's the block of code that starts with a declaration and finishes with an end declaration. There are two types of procedures in VBA. Sub procedures form an action in Excel and begin with the text \"Sub.\" Function procedures carry out calculations and return a value.\n\nA statement is an instruction that can be broken into two types. First, a declaration statement is used to state something, such as defining a constant or a variable value. Second, executable statements designate code that specifies what a certain action is.\n\nVariables are storage locations for defined items. They hold specific values that may change as VBA scripts are performed. The variable \"FirstName\" may not contain any value, but it can be assigned the FirstName variable and given the value \"Jo\" after the user inputs their name. Variables in coding can be different depending on the situation, similar to howvariable costscan change over time.\n\nLogical operators are the functions that allow for greater analytical and processing capabilities. They're bits of code that allow a computer to understand and compare items. VBA can analyze whether the user's name is \"Jo.\" The program can analyze the input and perform a logical evaluation using logical operators such as \"if, then\", \"true\", and \"false.\"\n\nVisual Basic for Applications is the\u00a0only\u00a0version of VB 6 that's still supported by Microsoft. It's only\u00a0available as an internal component of Office programs.\n\nVisual Basic for Applications allows users to perform myriad functions within MS Office applications that go beyond simple word processing andspreadsheet operations. VBA helps to make frequent everyday tasks less repetitive via macros for the most basic user.\n\nMacros can automate just about any task, such as generating customized charts and reports and performing word- and data-processing functions. You can write a macro with a single click that will allow Excel to create an entire balance sheet from a series ofaccountingentries in a spreadsheet.\n\nProgrammers use macros in more complex ways, like replicating large pieces of code, merging existing program functions, and designing specific languages. Advanced VBA code can convert a single row vector into a matrix, populate a range, or manipulate the characteristics of a sheet.\n\nVBA can also work in external, non-Microsoft settings by using a technology called COM interface that allows commands to interact across computer boundaries.Many firms have implemented VBA within their applications, both proprietary and commercial, including AutoCAD, ArcGIS, CATIA, Corel, raw, and SolidWorks.\n\nAny firm may use VBA to customize Excel for a unique purpose, such as discerning how long it would take to earn $1 million in an investment portfolio based on a specificinterest rateand other factors like the number of years until retirement.\n\nVBA is used to further expand what some programs can accomplish. It's often used to create macros, automate processes, generate custom forms, or perform repetitive tasks that may need minimal human intervention.\n\nVBA is a computer language that's used within Excel. It enhances its capabilities. Excel is a broader software that's used for many types of analytical functions.\n\nVBA is relatively easier to learn compared to other complex languages. It's considered a beginner-friendly language. VBA coders often don't have to have prior experience to learn the language. The VBA community also has many resources available for individuals who are new to programming.\n\nYes, VBA is still useful and used by individuals who are interacting with Microsoft products, but newer languages such as Python, C#, or R can be used to code in place of VBA. New tools such as Power Query may be able to perform tasks that could previously only be performed when using VBA.\n\nVBA was first introduced in 1991. It's been used for decades to automate processes, generate macros, and help individuals by performing repetitive tasks. Other, more powerful computer languages may have greater capabilities, but VBA is still useful and holds the advantage of being an easier, more basic language to learn.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation. \"Apps and Services.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn. \"Getting Started with VBA in Office.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn. \"Visual Basic Conceptual Topics.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn. \"Excel Performance: Improving Calculation Performance.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn. \"Support Statement for Visual Basic 6.0 on Windows.\"\n\nMicrosoft Learn. \"COM Objects and Interfaces.\"",
