  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA micromanager is a term used to refer to a person in the workplace who provides an excessive level of supervision to their employees. Micromanaging refers to the act of trying to control every aspect of how a task is completed.\n\nA micromanager might watch an employee's actions closely and provide frequent criticism of the employee\u2019s work and processes\u2014rather than simply telling an employee what task needs to be accomplished and by what date. Being labeled as a \"micromanager\" typically has negative associations for a person.\n\nMicromanaging has a negative connotation because an employee may feel that their manager is being condescending towards them; the implication is that the manager does not have trust or faith in the employee's competency. While this style of leadership may produce results in the long term, micromanagement can hurt employee and company morale over time.\n\nAlso, a manager who implements this management style creates an environment where their team develops insecurity and a lack of confidence in its work. In the absence of the manager, the team may find it difficult to function.\n\nA micromanager will usually use up most of their time supervising the work of their direct reports and exaggerating the importance of minor details to subordinates; time that could have been used to get other important things done. Although micromanagement is easily recognized by others in the firm, the micromanager may not view themselves as such.\n\nIn contrast to a micromanager, amacro manageris more effective in their management approach. Macro-managing defines broad tasks for direct reports to accomplish and then leaves them alone to do their work. Macro managers have confidence that the team can complete their tasks without being continually supervised and reminded of the processes.\n\nSigns of micromanagers include but are not limited to:\n\nFrom the list provided above, it is easy to understand that a micromanager struggles with meeting deadlines since work has to be redone repeatedly\u2014and valuable time is spent poring over inconsequential details. Team members eventually become frustrated and resentful as their work is undermined at every stage, and they have no autonomy over how to run an assigned project. Because team members' skills and development on the job are stunted, the micromanaging style ofleadershipis ineffective.\n\nA micromanager (who has identified themselves as such) can take a number of steps to break this habit:\n\nWhen someone is micromanaging, they attempt to control every part of how a task is done\u2014even very small and trivial aspects of an enterprise. Micromanaging is not a very efficient way to approach a task; and, generally, being labeled as a \"micromanager\" is a negative connotation. In a corporate setting, a manager or boss who micromanages their employees may attempt to control how their employees make decisions and excessively monitor their progress.\n\nMicromanaging in a professional setting refers to a leadership style that is overly critical and controlling; micromanagers attempt to influence every aspect of their employees' decision-making and often interfere in their processes, giving the impression that they do not have faith in the competency of others. For example, a micromanager may frequently check in with their employees, including scheduling one-on-one check-in meetings and asking for progress reports at every stage of a project.\n\nExcessive oversight by a manager or boss can be challenging, but there are ways to approach working with a micromanager that can improve your work environment. One step you can take is communicating openly. Specifically, this can look like explicitly expressing a desire for more autonomy over your work processes. You might try communicating that you understand their expectations\u2014you may even want to reiterate the timeline of a project, for example\u2014as a way of assuring your boss of your competency.\n\nIn a workplace, managers and bosses can exhibit certain behaviors\u2014a strong desire for control and excessive attention to detail\u2014that can be designated as \"micromanaging.\" Micromanaging is a management style that involves a specific set of behaviors: involvement in every aspect of an employee's work, closely monitoring tasks, providing detailed (and oftentimes critical) feedback, and creating detailed instructions, among others. It can be challenging to work for someone who is a micromanager. However, managers can take steps to avoid micromanaging, including setting clear expectations, identifying deadlines in advance, and encouraging employees to take ownership of their responsibilities.",
