  "term": "Synthetic: Definition in Finance, Types of Assets",
  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nSynthetic is the term given to financial instruments that are engineered to simulate other instruments while altering key characteristics, like duration and cash flow.\n\nOften synthetics will offer investors tailored cash flow patterns, maturities, risk profiles, and so on. Synthetic products are structured to suit the needs of the investor. There are many different reasons behind the creation of synthetic positions:\n\nFor example, you can create a synthetic option position by purchasing acall optionand simultaneously selling (writing) a put option on the same stock. If both options have the samestrike price, let's say $45, this strategy would have the same result as purchasing the underlying security at $45 when the options expire or are exercised. The\u00a0call option gives the buyer the right to purchase the underlying security at the strike, and theput optionobligates the seller to purchase the underlying security from the put buyer.\n\nIf the market price of the underlying security increases above the strike price, the call buyer will exercise their option to purchase the security at $45, realizing the profit. On the other hand, if the price falls below the strike, the put buyer will exercise their right to sell to the put seller who is obligated to buy the underlying security at $45. So the synthetic option position would have the same fate as a true investment in the stock, but without the capital outlay.This is, of course, a bullish trade; the bearish trade is done by reversing the two options (selling a call and buying a put).\n\nSynthetic products are more complex than synthetic positions, as they tend to be custom builds created through contracts. There are two main types ofgeneric securitiesinvestments:\n\nSome securities straddle a line, such as a dividend paying stock that also experiences appreciation. For most investors, aconvertible bondis as synthetic as things need to get.\n\nConvertible bonds are ideal for companies that want to issue debt at a lower rate. The goal of the issuer is to drive demand for a bond without increasing the interest rate or the amount it must pay for the debt. The attractiveness of being able to switch debt for the stock if it takes off attracts investors that want steady income but are willing to forgo a few points of that for the potential of appreciation. Different features can be added to the convertible bond to sweeten the offer. Some convertible bonds offer principal protection. Other convertible bonds offer increased income in exchange for a lower conversion factor. These features act as incentives for bondholders.\n\nImagine, however, an institutional investor that wants a convertible bond for a company that has never issued one. To fulfill this market demand, investment bankers work directly with the institutional investor to create a synthetic convertible purchasing the parts\u2014in this case, bonds and a long-term call option\u2014to fit the specific characteristics that the institutional investor wants. Most synthetic products are composed of a bond orfixed incomeproduct, which is intended to safeguard the principal investment, and an equity component, which is intended to achievealpha.\n\nProducts used for synthetic productscan be assets orderivatives, but synthetic products themselves are inherently derivatives. That is, the cash flows they produce are derived from other assets. There\u2019s even an asset class known as synthetic derivatives. These are the securities that are reverse engineered to follow the cash flows of a single security.\n\nSynthetic CDOs, for example, invest incredit default swaps. The synthetic CDO itself is further split into tranches that offer different risk profiles to large investors. These products can offer significant returns, but the nature of the structure can also leave high-risk, high-return tranche holders facing contractual liabilities that are not fully valued at the time of purchase. The innovation behind synthetic products has been a boon to global finance, but events like the financial crisis of 2007-09 suggest that the creators and buyers of synthetic products are not as well-informed as one would hope.\n\nIG Bank. \"What are the Benefits of Synthetic Trading for Institutional Investors?\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Convertible Securities.\"",
