  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nEthical investing refers to the practice of using one\u2019s ethical principles as the primary filter for the selection of securities investing. Ethical investing depends on the investor\u2019s views.\u00a0Ethical investing is sometimes used interchangeably with socially conscious investing; however, socially conscious funds typically have one overarching set of guidelines that are used to select theportfolio, whereas ethical investing brings about a more personalized result.\n\nEthical investing gives the individual the power to allocate capital toward companies whose practices and values align with their personal beliefs. Some beliefs are rooted in environmental, religious, or political precepts.\u00a0Some investors may choose to eliminate specific industries\u00a0or over-allocate to other sectors\u00a0that meet the individual\u2019s ethical guidelines.\n\nFor example, some ethical investors avoidsin stocks, which are companies\u00a0that are involved or primarily deal with traditionally unethical or immoral activities, such asgambling, alcohol, or firearms. Choosing an investment based on ethical preferences is not indicative of the investment\u2019s performance.\n\nTo begin, investors should carefully examine and document which investments to avoid and which are of interest.\u00a0Research is essential for accurately determining whether an investment or group of investments coincides with one\u2019s ethics, especially when investing in an index or mutual fund.\n\nOften, religion influences ethical investing. When religion is the motivation, industries with operations and practices that oppose the religion\u2019s tenets are avoided.\u00a0The earliest recorded instance of ethical investing in America was by the 18th century Quakers, who restricted members from spending their time or money in the slave trade.\n\nDuring the same era, John Wesley, a founder of Methodism, preached the importance of refraining from investing in industries that harm one\u2019s neighbor, such as chemical plants.Another example of a religious-based ethical investing regime\u00a0is seen\u00a0inIslamic banking,\u00a0which shuns investments in alcohol, gambling, pork, and other forbidden items.\n\nThe Amana Mutual Funds Trust offers investment products adhering to Islamic banking principles, such as prohibiting gambling (Maisir), paying or charging interest (riba), and charging more money for late payments (mur\u00e2ba\u1e25ah).\n\nIn the 20th century, ethical investing gained traction based on people\u2019s social views more than their religious views. Ethical investments tend to mirror the political climate and social trends of the time. In the United States in the 1960s\u00a0and \u201970s, ethical investors focused on those companies and organizations that promoted equality and rights for workers and shunned those that supported or profited from the Vietnam War.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, ethical investments\u00a0began to focus heavily on environmental issues. Ethical investors moved away from coal and fossil fuel companies and toward those that supported clean and sustainable energy. Today, ethical investing continues to primarily focus on impacts on the environment and society.\n\nIn addition to analyzing investments using ethical standards, the historical, current, and projected performance of the investment should be scrutinized. To examine whether the investment is sound and has the potential to reap significant returns, the review of a company\u2019s history and finances is warranted. It is also important to confirm the company\u2019s commitment to ethical practices.\n\nA company\u2019smission statementmay mirror the values and beliefs of an investor, yet their practices may be contrary to them. Consider Enron, which published and distributed a 64-pagecode of ethicsdocument to employees, highlighting their commitment to integrity and ethics.Indeed, it was proven that they not only did not adhere to their policies but alsoviolated a host of laws.\n\nNatural Investments. \u201cQuakers and SRI: Some Historic Perspective.\u201d\n\nDiscipleship Ministries, The United Methodist Church. \u201c\u2018The Use of Money\u2019 by John Wesley,\u201d download PDF, Page 6.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cIslamic Finance: Overview and Policy Concerns,\u201d Page 1 (Page 4 of PDF).\n\nSaturna Capital. \u201cHalal Investing.\u201d\n\nSaturna Capital. \u201cAmana Mutual Funds Trust: Equity Investment Process.\u201d\n\nNational Library of Medicine, National Center for Biotechnology Information. \u201cSocially Responsible Investing: From the Ethical Origins to the Sustainable Development Framework of the European Union.\u201d\n\nThe Citadel. \u201cCharacter and Ethics: The Enron Scandal,\u201d Page 4.",
