  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA business continuity plan (BCP) is a system of prevention and recovery from potential threats to a company. The plan ensures that personnel and assets are protected and can function quickly in the event of a disaster. BCPs are designed to protect a company's employees and its assets so they can get back to business whenever a disruption occurs. BCPs must be tested before an emergency situation to ensure they work and weaknesses are identified and corrected.\n\nBCPs are an important part of any business. Threats, disruptions,\u00a0or halts to the business activity for any period, mean losses and higher costs as well as the difficulty to start back again. This leads to a drop in profitability, financial loss, and the potential forbankruptcy and liquidation.\n\nThe goal of a BCP is to get the business back on track with little to no interruption. BCP involves defining all risks that can affect a company's operations, making it an important part of the organization's risk management strategy. Risks may include natural disasters (fire, flood, weather-related events, or pandemics), acts of terrorism, orcyber-attacks. Once the risks are identified, the plan should also include:\n\nBusinesses can't rely on insurance alone because it doesn't cover all the costs or the customers who move to the competition. This is why BCP is generally conceived in advance and involves input from keystakeholdersand personnel.\n\nBusiness impact analysis, recovery, organization, and training are all steps corporations need to follow when creating a Business Continuity Plan.\n\nBusinesses are prone to a host of disasters that vary in degree from minor to catastrophic. Business continuity planning is typically meant to\u00a0help a company\u00a0continue operating in the event of major disasters like fires. BCPs are different from a disaster recovery plan, which focuses on therecovery of a company's information technology systemafter a crisis.\n\nConsider a finance company based in a major city. It may put a BCP in place by taking steps that include backing up its computer and client files offsite. If something were to happen to the company's corporate office, its satellite offices would still have access to important information.\n\nAn important point to note is that BCP may not be effective if a large portion of the population is affected, as in the case of a disease outbreak. Nonetheless, BCPs can improverisk management\u2014preventing disruptions from spreading. They can also help mitigate downtime of networks or technology, saving the company money.\n\nThere are several steps many companies must follow to develop a solid BCP. They include:\n\nCompanies may also find it useful to come up with a checklist that includes key details such as emergency contact information, a list of resources the continuity team may need, where backup data and other required information are housed or stored, and other important personnel.\n\nAlong with testing the continuity team, the company should also test the BCP itself. It should be tested several times to ensure it can be applied to many differentrisk scenarios. This will help identify any weaknesses in the plan which can then be corrected.\n\nFor a business continuity plan to be successful, all employees\u2014even those who aren't on the continuity team\u2014must be aware of the plan.\n\nAn important part of developing a BCP is a business continuity impact analysis. It identifies the effects of disruption of business functions and processes. It also uses the information to make decisions about recovery priorities and strategies.\n\nTheFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)provides an operational and financial impact worksheet to help run a business continuity analysis. The worksheet should be completed by business function and process managers who are well acquainted with the business. These worksheets will summarize the following:\n\nCompleting the analysis can help companies identify and prioritize theprocesses that have the most impacton the business's financial and operational functions. The point at which they must be recovered is generally known as the \u201crecovery time objective.\u201d\n\nBCPs and disaster recovery plans are similar where the latter focuses on technology and information technology infrastructure. BCPs are more encompassing than disaster recovery plans because they focus on the entire organization, such as customer service and supply chain.\u00a0BCPs also focus on reducing overall costs or losses.\n\nDisaster recovery plans, on the other hand, only look at technology downtimes and related costs. They are implemented in different cases, including when there's a failure in communication, a power outage, or a natural disaster to name a few. Disaster recovery plans tend to involve only IT personnel, which create and manage the policy. However, BCPs tend to have more personnel trained on the potential processes.\n\nBusinesses are prone to a host of disasters that vary in degree from minor to catastrophic and business continuity plans (BCPs) are an important part of any business. BCP is typically meant to help a company continue operating in the event of threats and disruptions. This could result in a loss of revenue and higher costs, which leads to a drop in profitability. And businesses can't rely on insurance alone because it doesn't cover all the costs and the customers who move to the competition.\n\nBusiness continuity plans involve identifying any and all risks that can affect the company's operations. The plan should also determine how those risks will affect operations and implement safeguards and procedures to mitigate the risks. There should also be testing procedures to ensure these safeguards and procedures work. Finally, there should be a review process to make sure that the plan is up to date.\n\nAn important part of developing a BCP is a business continuity impact analysis which identifies the effects of disruption of business functions and processes. It also uses the information to make decisions about recovery priorities and strategies.\n\nFEMA provides an operational and financial impact worksheet to help run a business continuity analysis.\n\nThese worksheets summarize the impacts\u2014both financial and operational\u2014that stem from the loss of individual business functions and processes. They also identify when the loss of a function or process would result in the identified business impacts.\n\nBusiness continuity plans are created to help speed up the recovery of an organization filling a threat or disaster. The plan puts in place mechanisms and functions to allow personnel and assets to minimize company downtime. BCPs cover all organizational risks should a disaster happen, such as a flood or fire.\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency. \"Business Process Analysis and Business Impact Analysis User Guide.\" Pages A1-C1.\n\nReady. \u201cIT Disaster Recovery Plan.\u201d",
