  "term": "What Is Philanthropy? Examples, History, Benefits, and Types",
  "definition": "Philanthropy is an effort an individual or organization undertakes based on an altruistic desire to improve human welfare. It refers to charitable acts or other good works, like efforts that help others or that contribute to the well-being of society overall on a grand scale. It may involve charitable giving to worthy causes. Wealthy individuals sometimes establishprivate foundationsto facilitate their philanthropic efforts.\n\nNonprofitsare organizations set up to support a variety of social causes, such as educational, health, scientific, public safety, and human rights, that generally do philanthropic work. In the United States, organizations that qualify as nonprofits are exempt from federal tax liability under theInternal Revenue Code (IRC) 501(c).\n\nFor some people, philanthropy means donations of money, often large sums, to support or create university buildings, research centers, or fund four-year collegescholarships. For others, acts of philanthropy mean an annual donation to a local theater, food pantry, or public school.\n\nThere are many ways to makecharitable contributionson a local to a global scale, including corporate philanthropy. There are also individual philanthropists. Philanthropy may be done fortax breaksor altruism, or a combination of the two things. Anyone can be a philanthropist if they give of their talent, time, money, or skills.\n\nThe word philanthropy traces its origins to the Latin wordphilanthropiaand the Greek wordphilanthr\u014dpia, which mean love or kindness to mankind.\n\nPhilanthropy dates back to Greek society. For instance, Plato instructed his nephew in hiswillto use the proceeds of the family farm to fund the academy that he founded in 347 B.C. The money helped students and faculty keep the academy running.\n\nAround 150 years later, Pliny the Younger contributed one-third of the funds for a Roman school for young boys. He instructed the fathers of the students to come up with the rest.The intention was to educate young Romans in the city rather than having them go abroad for schooling.\n\nIn 1630, John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony preached to Puritan settlers that the rich should care for the poor, who could not help themselves.And in 1638, John Harvard laid the foundations forHarvard Universityafter bequeathing half of his estate to found the school.\n\nMore modern and notable philanthropists include Mother Teresa and John D. Rockefeller. In the 21st century, philanthropy continues to be practiced in many forms by individuals like Warren Buffett, Melinda Gates, and Dolly Parton, as well as corporations.\n\nTechnology, including social media, has also shaped how individuals can give to others.\n\nThere are many benefits to being a philanthropist. Experts conclude that charitable giving can improve one's emotional and even physical well-being, and philanthropists have the satisfaction of knowing they have contributed to the greater good.In fact, some studies show that philanthropists have less depression, higher self-esteem, lower blood pressure, and may even live longer than those who don't give.\n\nThebenefits of philanthropyare not limited to individuals. Corporations that support charitable giving receive a wealth of benefits, including building a better public image, creating more vital brand awareness, and attracting new partners as well as talent who may be drawn to a company that contributes to charities.\n\nIn addition, employees who work for companies that give back to society are happier and contribute more to their jobs. And, because corporations are created to make money, a strong philanthropic streak often boosts sales and brings in new customers.\n\nThecharitable contributions deductionallows American taxpayers who make substantial charitable gifts to take generous tax deductions for the year in which their donations were made, provided they itemize their deductions on their tax returns.\n\nWhile it is true that individuals benefit from charitable giving when tax time comes, some benefit more than others. The IRS allows most individuals to deduct around 60% of theiradjusted gross income (AGI), but in some cases, 20%, 30%, or 50% limits may apply.\n\nThere are very wealthy individuals who use charitable giving toshield themselves from large tax bills.But some saybillionairesare dodging paying their fair share of taxes under the guise of charitable giving.\n\nAmericans and U.S. organizations and corporations gave about $557.16 billion to national charities in 2023. That number increased 1.9% in real dollars, but declined 2.1% when adjusted for inflation, according to Giving USA 2024, an annual report by the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. The all-time, inflation-adjusted high was set in 2021 and has not been surpassed since.\n\nSome of the highlights from Giving USA's annual report include:\n\nReligious organizations ($145.81 billion), human services ($88.84), and education ($87.69) received the most money. Donations to foundations (15.4%), public-society benefits (11.6%), and education (11.1%) grew the most. These figures were not adjusted forinflation.\n\nWhile the increases don't match the levels of giving in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, total giving remains above pre-pandemic levels, even after adjusting for inflation.\n\nMany people in the United States give money to causes they believe in. The following are some examples of people and corporations that engage in philanthropic activities or did so in the past.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of philanthropy comes fromAndrew Carnegie, simply because of the scale of his giving. Carnegie's wealth helped build more than 2,500 libraries all over the world. He also endowed several universities and a charitable trust that still runs 100 years after Carnegie's death in 1919.\n\nEstimates of his totalcharitable contributionsexceed an estimated $350 million. Carnegie lived up to his credo that a man who dies rich dies disgraced, and the rest of society learned to follow his example.\n\nThe Ford Foundation's legacy of giving is another example of how philanthropy works, The corporation was established by Edsel Ford, the son of Ford Motor Company founder Henry Ford. The foundation focuses on strengthening democracy, improving economic opportunity, and advancing education.\n\nSome of the areas the organization covers include:\n\nBillionaire and MicrosoftmogulBill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda, established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to support global development and global health programs. The organization works globally and in the United States to research and combat disease and to fight poverty. According to the foundation's website, it has spent almost $54 billion on charitable giving since 2000. The foundation is committed to increasing its annual payout to $9 billion by 2026.\n\nYou don't have to be a billionaire or give money away to be considered a philanthropist. In fact, there are notable individuals who aren't ultra-rich and are known for their philanthropic efforts. Mother Teresa is one of the most famous examples. The Catholic nun set up the Order of the Missionaries of Charity (now known simply as the Missionaries of Charity) in Kolkata, India, in 1950. The goal of the organization was to provide vulnerable communities with \"material and spiritual welfare.\"\n\nWhile some use the words charity and philanthropy interchangeably, philanthropy often casts a broader net of giving. Its role is to help society or groups in the community flourish over a long-term period. Charity is usually based on individual giving and helping in a short-term way, like donating coats to the homeless in winter, helping out or contributing goods to a local food pantry, or sending money to a scholarship fund. These are all acts of charity but may not be considered philanthropic efforts like building a school or a library or donating millions to a scholarship fund.\n\nAccording to an annual report inForbesmagazine, Warren Buffet has donated the most money, $56.7 billion, over his 93 years, as of February 2024.\n\nAnyone can become a philanthropist, even if they are not wealthy individuals. You can donate your time, efforts, and cash to a specific cause, and over time, you may become known as a philanthropist.\n\nCorporate philanthropy is the act of giving to charitable causes and/or organizations by corporations. The most common way of giving through a corporation is by donating money, but there are other ways to do so. Some of them include volunteering (as when employees donate their time to charities), scholarships, community investments, and sponsorships.\n\nPhilanthropycan take many different forms. It can be done by individuals and corporations. Or it may combine their efforts\u2014for example, when a company matches donations that individual employees make. Or it can be done by bequest, which means instructions are left to give money and other assets to charity in a trust or someone's will. People can donate money directly to charity, fund scholarships, or offer grants and stipends. And it isn't just money that falls under the philanthropic umbrella. People can donate their time through volunteer work.\n\nMany of the world's billionaires donate a good portion of their wealth to charitable causes. And it can be hard to live up to that reputation. Contrary to what you may think, you don't have to be among the ultra-rich to be a philanthropist. Donating some of your monthly income may feel like the only way you can do good in the world but there are other ways to make a difference. Giving some of your free time to causes you believe in is also a great way to become a philanthropist.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Exemption Requirements - 501(c)(3) Organizations.\"\n\nThe Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. \"Plato: The Academy.\"\n\nDix, T.
