  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAriel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nIn finance, the term \u201czero percent\u201d refers to promotionalinterest ratesused to entice consumers. They are often used by businesses wishing to sellbig-ticket itemssuch as cars or home appliances.\n\nAlthough zero-percent financing might seem attractive, consumers should be aware of any hidden fees embedded in the offer and should ensure that they are able to fully repay the debt once the promotional period has expired.\n\nStores often offer aggressive financing packages toincentivizecustomers to purchase relatively expensive items. For example, a car dealership might offer zero-percent financing for a certain number of years on its vehicles. Given that most cars are priced at $30,000 or more, this type of low-cost financing might make it possible for customers to buy the car despite not having the cash available to buy it outright otherwise.\n\nIt is important to note, however, that these offers may not be as affordable as they seem. After all, zero percent offers typically last for only a limited period of time, such as six months or one year. After the promotional period has ended, any unpaid balance will typically incur a much higher interest rate. If the customer has not managed to repay the debt by that time, they might find themselves surprised by the sudden increase in monthly payments, and may even be forced intodefault.\n\nUltimately, stores that offer zero-percent financing are relying on the fact that many customers will have failed to pay off the balance of their purchase by the time the promotional period is over. They, therefore, hope to benefit from the much higher interest rates charged afterward. Similarly, stores will sometimes increase the upfront price of the product before offering it under flexible financing terms. For instance, they might increase the cost of a car by 5% before offering it to customers under a zero percent financing program. In instances such as this, the zero percent interest offer can be misleading.\n\nKyle is shopping for a new TV at a localbig-boxelectronics store. He is pleased to find that many of the high-end models are being offered under very generous financing terms.\n\nOne of these models, a $2,500 4K TV, is being offered with zero percent financing for twelve months. Although Kyle had only saved $1,500 toward this purchase, he reasons that there is no harm in purchasing the more expensive TV since he can delay making payments on it for a full year, even without paying interest.\n\nUnfortunately for Kyle, he had failed to adequately read the details of the offer. One year later, he receives his first bill from the electronics store. Because the promotional period has ended, he is now being charged interest at a post-promotional rate of 20%. Unless he quickly pays off the outstanding balance of the TV, he may find that the true cost of the purchase was far greater than he had imagined.\n\nIn addition, 0% financing deals often include a provision that will add any deferred interest back into the balance due, if the entire amount is not paid off prior to the end of the promotional period. It pays to read the fine print of any 0% financing offer.",
