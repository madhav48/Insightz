  "term": "Direct Marketing: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "Direct marketing is a form of advertising without using a third party.\n\nDirect marketing is a form of advertising that consists of any promotion that relies on direct communication or distribution to individual consumers rather than through athird party, such as mass media. Mail, email, social media, and texting campaigns are among the delivery systems used.\u00a0It is called direct marketing because it generally eliminates the middleman, such as advertising media.\n\nUnlike traditional public relations campaigns pushed out through a third party like media publications or mass media, direct marketing campaigns directly communicate with target audiences.\n\nIn direct marketing, companies deliver their messaging and sales pitches bysocial media, email, mail, phone/SMS, and door-to-door visits. Although the number of communications sent can be massive, direct marketing often attempts to personalize the message by inserting the recipient's name or city in a prominent place to increase engagement.\n\nThecall to actionis an essential part of direct marketing. The recipient of the message is urged to immediately respond by calling a toll-free phone number, sending in a reply card, or clicking on a link in a social media or emailpromotion. Any response is a positive indicator of a prospective purchaser. This variety of direct marketing is often called direct response marketing.\n\nOpt-out options makes it harder for companies to track whether their direct marketing works.\n\nA direct marketing pitch that is delivered to the widest possible audience is probably the least effective. With that strategy, the company may gain a few customers while annoying all of the other recipients. Junk mail, spam email, and texting all are forms of direct marketing that many people can't get rid of fast enough.\n\nThe most effective direct marketing campaigns use lists of targeted prospects to send their messages only to the likeliest prospects. For example, the lists might target families who have recently had a baby, newhomeowners, or recent retirees with products or services that they are most likely to need.\n\nCatalogs are the oldest form of direct marketing, with a history that dates back to the latter half of the 19th century.In modern times, catalogs are usually sent only to consumers who have indicated an interest in a previous purchase of a similar product.\n\nA lot of direct marketing takes place on the internet. Platforms of choice include social media and email.\n\nSocial media has emerged as the most modern form of direct marketing. Targeting strategies can also be used on social media when putting out ads; platforms like Facebook allow brands to choose the age, gender, demographics, and even interests of potential new audiences that an ad could reach.\n\nMany companies engage inopt-in or permission marketing, which limits their mailing or emailing to people who have indicated a willingness to receive it. Lists of opt-in subscribers are particularly valuable as they indicate a real interest in the products or services being advertised.\n\nAllows companies to track and measure their success\n\nMay seem intrusive and lead to low response rates\n\nThird-party relationships may cost a lot\n\nAn example of direct marketing is a company sending promotional emails about its products or services directly to potential customers. Most companies periodically reach out to consumers who agreed to receive communications in a bid to sell them something. The email may flag a special offer, new product range, or the fact the company sells something that is currently popular or in season.\n\nDirect marketing involves explicitly trying to sell goods or services to customers. Indirect marketing, on the other hand, is marketing without trying to sell a specific product or service. An example of indirect marketing is writing and sharing a blog post or newsletter.\n\nThe aim of direct marketing is to boost awareness and sales. If successful, the communication will familiarize the consumer with the company and tempt them to make a purchase and tell others about it.\n\nMarketing strategies are often broken down into types. One of these types is direct marketing, which, as the name implies, involves advertising straight to the consumer rather than through a third party such as the media. Methods of communication include email, social media, mail, phone calls, text messages, and knocking on doors, and the most effective campaigns are based on targeting people who have previously expressed an interest or who match the targeted demographic.\n\nSmithsonian, National Postal Museum. \"Catalogs and the Mail Order Industry.\"\n\nSmithsonian, National Postal Museum. \"Direct Marketing, Advertising Agencies, and Designers.\"",
