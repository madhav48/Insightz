She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nProperty management is the daily oversight of residential, commercial, or industrial real estate by a third-party contractor. Generally,property managerstake responsibility for day-to-day repairs and ongoing maintenance, security, and upkeep of properties. They usually work for the owners of investment properties such as apartment and condominium complexes, private home communities, shopping centers, and industrial parks.\n\nTheir main roles are to manage routine tasks delegated to them by the owners and to preserve the value of the properties that they manage while generatingincome.\n\nProperty developers generally want to move on to the next project as soon as each one is completed. Even if they continue to holdtitleto the property, they prefer to delegate the day-to-day operations to an outside company.\n\nThe responsibilities of a property manager generally involve the following:\n\nThe companies must comply with any state and local landlord-tenant laws and regulations.\n\nOwners pay property managers afeeor a percentage of the rent generated by a property while it is under their management.\n\nJust as property comes in many types, so do property managers. Some firms are specialized in providing management for a particular type of property, while others offer management services over a range of property types. A huge range of property types can be managed.\n\nResidential property managers are typically hired for rental properties, and they manage the rental process. They can be hired to manage:\n\nCommercial property owners have different needs from those who own residential property. Commercial property management can apply to:\n\nIndustrial properties that can benefit from management include:\n\nThere are also numerous types of property that don\u2019t fit neatly into the categories above, but that require management nonetheless. These include:\n\nSeveral types of property owners can benefit from the services that property managers offer.\n\nLandlords, for example, hire property management firms for a variety of reasons. Some may have multiple rental properties in their portfolios and lack the time or expertise to maintain the properties and deal with individual tenants. Some owners only have an interest in owning rental properties and earning profits from them. When this is the case, they hire professional property managers.Absentee landlordsalso make use of property management services. Some property management companies cater to individual landlords who rent out a single property such as a vacation home.\n\nProperty owners who participate inaffordable housingprograms tend to use property management services because their rental properties are subject to complex federal guidelines that require specialized expertise. Certainreal estatebrokers also operate as property managers. For example, abrokerin a resort town may provide buyer and seller agent services as well as property management services. When this is the case, the real estate broker lists, shows, leases, and maintains vacation rentals for a number of property owners.\n\nProperty managers are different from community managers, who deal with common areas rather than individual units and don\u2019t necessarily deal directly with landlords.\n\nProperty management licensing requirements vary by state.Most states require property management companies to be licensed by the local real estate board, so property owners need to make sure that the firms they hire are properly licensed.\n\nFor instance, property managers in Florida are required to havereal estate broker\u2019s licensesto operate in the state.That\u2019s because some of their responsibilities are deemed real estate activity. Holding a real estate broker\u2019s license allows property managers to list rental properties in themultiple listing service (MLS)and to market the properties by standard real estate marketing methods. Holding a real estate broker\u2019s license also allows the property management company to place a real estate board lockbox on a property\u2019s door so that other licensed agents can show the property.\n\nFlorida also requires property managers to hold a broker\u2019s license if they deal with rentals or leases and receive acommissionfor their services. However, property managers who manage the properties that they own in the state don\u2019t need a license to do so.\n\nManagers in Massachusetts don\u2019t require a broker\u2019s license.That\u2019s because certain duties considered to be real estate activities, such as listing and leasing properties, may be secondary to the main duties performed by the property manager.\n\nIt depends. Managing property can be costly and take a lot of time. If the cost of a property manager is less than theopportunity costof managing properties yourself, it\u2019s probably a good investment. However, this is an equation that every investor will have to work through for themselves.\n\nAny property manager who doesn\u2019t want to deal with the day-to-day management of property can potentially benefit from property management. This can include a residential property owner who doesn\u2019t want the headaches of dealing with tenants, or commercial property owners who prefer others to source and manage tenants, leases, and maintenance.\n\nYes. Property management licensing requirements vary by state, but most states require property management companies to be licensed by the local real estate board. Property owners should make sure that the firms they hire are properly licensed.\n\nProperty management is the oversight of real estate by a third party, normally a professional property manager or property management company. Property managers can manage many different types of property: residential, commercial, industrial, and property for special purposes.\n\nProperty managers are generally responsible for the day-to-day operations of the real estate, from screening tenants to arranging for repairs and maintenance, and are paid via a\u00a0fee\u00a0or a percentage of the rent generated by the property. Every state has its own laws regulating the activities of property managers, so it\u2019s important for property owners to check that potential property managers are properly licensed for their state.\n\nAll Property Management. \u201cProperty Management Laws by State.\u201d\n\nAll Property Management. \u201cProperty Management Laws in Florida.\u201d\n\nAll Property Management. \u201cProperty Management Laws in Massachusetts.\u201d",
