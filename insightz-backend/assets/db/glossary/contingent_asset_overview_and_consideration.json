  "term": "Contingent Asset: Overview and Consideration",
  "definition": "A contingent asset is a potential economic benefit that is dependent on some future event(s) largely out of a company\u2019s control. A contingent asset is thus also known as a potential asset.\n\nNot knowing for certain whether these gains will materialize, or being able to determine their precise economic value, means these assets cannot be recordedon thebalance sheet. However, they can be reported in the\u00a0accompanying footnotes offinancial statements, provided that certain conditions are met.\n\nA contingent asset becomes a realized asset recordable on the balance sheet when the realization ofcash flowsassociated with it becomes relatively certain. In this case, the asset is recognized in the period when the change in status occurs.\n\nContingent assets may arise due to the\u00a0economic value\u00a0being unknown. Alternatively, they might occur due to uncertainty relating to the outcome of an event in which an asset may be created. A contingent asset appears because of previous events, but the entirety of all asset information will not be collected until future events happen.\n\nThere also existscontingentor\u00a0potential liabilities. Unlike contingent assets, they refer to a potential loss that may be incurred, depending on how a certain future event unfolds.\n\nA company involved in a lawsuit that expects to receive compensation has a contingent asset because the outcome of the case is not yet known and the dollar amount is yet to be determined.\n\nLet\u2019s say Company ABC has filed a lawsuit against Company XYZ for infringing apatent. If there is a decent chance that Company ABC will win the case, it has a contingent asset. This potential asset will generally be disclosed in its financial statement, but not recorded as an asset until the lawsuit is settled.\n\nBased on this same example, Company XYZ would need to disclose a potential contingent liability in its notes and then later record it in its accounts, should it lose the lawsuit and be ordered to pay damages.\n\nContingent assets also crop up when companies expect to receive money through the use of a warranty. Other examples include benefits to be received from an estate or other court settlement. Anticipatedmergers and acquisitionsare to be disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nBothgenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP) andInternational Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS) require companies to disclose contingent assets if there is a decent possibility that these potential gains will eventually be realized. For U.S. GAAP, there generally needs to be a 70% likelihood that the gain occurs. IFRS, on the other hand, is slightly more lenient and generally permits companies to make reference to potential gains if there is at least a 50% likelihood that they will occur.\n\nInternational Accounting Standard37\u00a0(IAS 37), applicable to IFRS, states the following:\u201cContingent assets are not recognized, but they are disclosed when it is more likely than not that an inflow of benefits will occur. However, when the inflow of benefits is virtually certain an asset is recognized in the statement of financial position because that asset is no longer considered to be contingent.\u201d\n\nContingent asset accounting policies for GAAP, meanwhile, are mainly outlined in theFinancial Accounting Standards Board's(FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 450.\n\nCompanies must reevaluate the potential asset continually. When a contingent asset becomes likely, firms must report it in financial statements by estimating the income to be collected. The estimate is generated using a range of possible outcomes, the associated risks, and experience with similar potential contingent assets.\n\nContingent assets are ruled under theconservatismprinciple, which is an accounting practice that states that uncertain events and outcomes should be reported in a manner that results in the lowest potentialprofit. In other words, companies are discouraged from inflating expectations and are generally advised to utilize the lowest estimated asset valuation.\n\nIn addition, no gain may be recorded from a contingent asset until it actually occurs. The conservatism principle supersedes the matching principle ofaccrual accounting, meaning the asset may not be reported until a period after associated costs were incurred.\n\nDeloitte. \"A Roadmap to Accounting for Contingencies and Loss Recoveries,\" Page 77.
