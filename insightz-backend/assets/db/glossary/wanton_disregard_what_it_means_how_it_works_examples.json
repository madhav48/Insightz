  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nWanton disregard is a legal term that denotes an individual's extreme lack of care for the well-being or rights of another individual. Wanton disregard is a serious accusation that indicates that a person behaved extremely recklessly and is most commonly used in an insurance context, where it refers to negligence\u00a0to describe reckless behavior that has led to damages or injury.\n\nWanton\u00a0disregard may also be referred to as wanton conduct and may more formally be expressed as willful and wanton disregard.\n\nWhen an individual fails to employ reasonableduty of carein their actions, it constitutes\u00a0negligence. Yet not all negligence is the same. There are degrees of negligence.\n\nWanton disregard in the legal sense is not always deliberately malicious, though it is\u00a0more serious than mere carelessness. In a lawsuit, wanton disregard might result inpunitive damages, depending on the severity of the situation and state laws.\n\nOrdinary negligence requires that an individual\u00a0behave in a way that is\u00a0contrary to how\u00a0areasonable personwould act under the same or similar circumstances. It may also entail an individual failing to do something that a reasonable person would be expected to do. Negligence laws require that individuals undertake reasonable actions to protect themselves or others from harm\u2014a standard of care.\u00a0When such a duty is not met, payment for damages may be recovered.\n\nIn general, gross negligence denotes indifference on the part of an individual or entity. It is a significantly greater lack of care or diligence than ordinary negligence. Courts define gross negligence as a violation of the legal duty to the rights of other individuals. In wrongful death cases, a court must find evidence of gross negligence to award punitive damages.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nSuch behavior comes very close to actual intent to cause harm or damages without actually crossing over into malicious behavior.\u00a0For example, the phrase\u00a0\"willful and wanton disregard\" suggests that the danger of an action is understood by an individual. They know it is likely to cause a substantial harm,\u00a0yet\u00a0they do it\u00a0anyway.\n\nAfinancial advisorat a large firm uses the company's online database to store sensitive information about their clients. The database is hacked and a client's identity is stolen. The client tells their financial advisor they think their identity has been stolen through the financial advisor's firm. The financial advisor notifies the appropriate people within the company, but they do not correct the problem.\n\nThis would be considered wanton disregard because while the company is not intentionally or maliciously exposing its clients' sensitive financial data, it is recklessly ignoring a problem that it has been made aware of.\n\nAnother example of wanton disregard would be a supervisor instructing a subordinate to service a piece of machinery while it was still running. A reasonable person would know that this is unreasonably dangerous behavior. Any injury that resulted from such an action would be evidence of wanton disregard.\n\nLouisiana Law Review. \"Reflections on Willful, Wanton, Reckless, and Gross Negligence,\" Pages 1383-1409.
