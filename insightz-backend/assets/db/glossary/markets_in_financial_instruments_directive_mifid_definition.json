Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nThe\u00a0Markets\u00a0in\u00a0Financial Instruments Directive\u00a0(MiFID) is a\u00a0European regulation that increases\u00a0the transparency across the European Union's financial markets\u00a0and standardizes the regulatory disclosures required for firms operating there.\n\nMiFID implemented\u00a0new measures, such as pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and set out the standards of conduct to be followed by financial firms. MiFID has a defined scope that primarily focuses on stocks. The directive was drafted in 2004 and has been in force across theEuropean\u00a0Union(EU) since\u00a02007. MiFID was replaced by MiFID II in 2018.\n\nThe stated aim of MiFID is for all EU members to share a common, robust regulatory framework that protects investors. MiFID came into effect a year before the2008 financial crisis, but changes were made following it that took shape inMiFID II. One issue in the original drafts was that the regulatory approach in dealing with countries outside of the European Union was left up to each member state. This meant that some firms outside of the EU could have a competitive advantage\u00a0over firms inside the union because of the easier regulatory oversight.\n\nThis issue was addressed through MiFID II (implemented in January 2018), which harmonized the rules for all firms with EU clients. MiFID focused primarily on stocks, which was seen as a limitation because it did not include the vast amount of financial products available in the market, such asover-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.\n\nOTC transactions are done between two parties without anyexchangein the middle to act as a supervisor. As a result, there was less regulatory oversight and transparency for the parties engaging in an OTC trade. Implementing MiFID II brought many more financial products under its purview. The Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) works in conjunction with MiFID and\u00a0MiFID II as a regulation rather than a directive to\u00a0extend the codes of conduct beyond stocks to other types of assets.\n\nThe European Union began enforcing the Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation (MiCA) in July 2023, which complements the 2022 MiFID II amendment that added crypto-assets, Regulation 2022/858.\n\nOne of the key aspects of MiFID is the classification of clients into specific client types. There are three client types: professional clients,retail clients, and eligible counterparties. The goal for the classifications is that the regulatory protection for the clients should reflect the different levels of risks for each client type.\n\nThe idea is that different types of clients, or investors, will have different levels of financial knowledge and should be given different levels of protection when dealing with a financial body, such as a bank. Eligible counterparties are provided the least protection, and retail clients are provided the highest.\n\nDepending on the client type, they are provided with different levels of information necessary for their understanding of the specific risks, overall explanations, and details of that transaction.\n\nMiFID is just one part of the regulatory changes sweeping the EU and impacting the financial firms' compliance departments, e.g., insurers, mutual fund providers, and banks operating\u00a0there. Taken together with other regulatory initiatives, like theGeneral Data Protection Regulation(GDPR) and MiFIR, the EU is following through on its vision of a transparent market with clear rights and protections for EU citizens.\n\nAs with any regulatory framework, many\u00a0rules are tweaks to existing regulations, such as the requirements for disclosure where aconflict of interestexists. However, several best practices, like appointing a single officer to protect client interests from inside the firm, are now explicit requirements for firms that want to access the EU market.\n\nIn 2018, the European Commission enacted a revised directive calledMiFID II. First proposed in 2012, the revised directive was intended to restore confidence in the markets following the2008 market crash.\n\nWhile MiFID was limited to equity stocks, MiFID II extended the requirements to issuers of all types of securities, including debt securities, derivatives, and structured instruments. The new regulation enhanced the transparency and reporting requirements of securities trades, reducing the use of dark pools and OTC trading. It also extended investor protection for all types of securities trades, whether the investor was located inside or outside of the European Union.\n\nIn 2022, MiFID II was amended to include tokenized securities, crypto-assets, and other distributed ledger-based instruments.\n\nFor banks that provide asset management or investment services, MiFID II requires financial instruments to be traded only in multilateral and regulated trading platforms, or those that adhere to the transparency requirements of OTC trading. These rules are intended to protect investors and eliminate dark trading of securities.\n\nMiFID II enhanced the transparency and reporting requirements of the older MiFID regulation. One key difference is the expansion of its scope: while MiFID applied largely to equities markets, MiFID II applies to all types of securities and derivatives.\n\nAfter the United Kingdom left the European Union, the two economies had two substantially similar regulatory regimes, but they lost their ability to trade easily. British firms lost their license to provide financial services to EU clients and vice versa. It also created duplicate reporting requirements for the two areas.\n\nMiFID, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, was a set of European regulations governing equities markets in the European Union. It was intended to enhance transparency and reporting requirements to protect European investors. These rules were replaced by the revised MiFID II regulation in 2018 and the amendment of 2022.\n\nEuropean Council. \"Digital Finance: Council Adopts New Rules on Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA).\"\n\nEuropean Securities and Markets Authority. \"Regulation (EU) 2022/858 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2022.\"\n\nHSBC. \"Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).\"",
