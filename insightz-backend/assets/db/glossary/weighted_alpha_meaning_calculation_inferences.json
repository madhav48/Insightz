  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nWeighted alpha measures the performance of a security over a certain period, usually a year, but with relatively more importance given to recent activity compared to earlier performance.\n\nAlpha(\u03b1) is a term used to describe an investment strategy's ability to beat the market, or its \"edge.\"\u00a0Alpha is thus also often referred to as \u201cexcess return\u201d or \u201cabnormal rate of return,\u201d which refers to the idea that markets are efficient, and so there is no way to systematically earn returns that exceed the broad market as a whole.\n\nAs implied in the name, weighted alpha is aweightedmeasure of how much a security, say a stock, has risen or fallen over a defined period, usually a year. Generally, more emphasis is placed on recent activity by assigning higher weights to later performance measurements than those assigned to earlier measurements. This helps to give a return figure that has a greater focus on the most current period, which should prove to be more relevant when analyzing that security. This metric is quite popular withtechnical analystsand those who tend to rely on analytics to augment their trading decision.\n\nWeighted alpha uses weighted mathematical calculations to arrive at analphaperformance figure. Alpha is a measure of risk-adjusted performance relative to a benchmark. In the field ofasset management, alpha is often thought of as a proxy for the fund manager's skill. That reasoning can also be valid when analyzing a stock, which is, in part, a reflection of the effectiveness of a firm's management team.\n\nFor example, a stock that had returns on par with the benchmark, adjusted for the level of risk assumed, has an alpha of zero. A positive alpha shows that the stock produced a return greater than the benchmark, while a negative alpha indicates the converse.\n\nWeighted calculations give an assigned weight based on various factors. Indexes use weighting to give higher weight to securities by price or market cap. In a weighted alpha calculation, higher weight is typically given to more recent time period returns over a time series.\n\nWeighted alpha calculations usually focus on one year of asecurity\u2019sreturn. In general, if a security has a positive weighted alpha, an investor can assume its price has been gaining over the past year. Adversely, if a security\u2019s price has a negative weighted alpha, investors can assume that the one-year price return is lower.\n\n\ufeffWeighted\u00a0Alpha=\u2211(W\u00d7\u03b1)nwhere:W=weight\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0data\u00a0point\u03b1=alphan=number\u00a0of\u00a0days\u00a0in\u00a0defined\u00a0time\u00a0series\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Weighted Alpha} = \\frac { \\sum ( W \\times \\alpha ) }{ n } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &W = \\text{weight assigned to each data point} \\\\ &\\alpha = \\text{alpha} \\\\ &n = \\text{number of days in defined time series} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bWeighted\u00a0Alpha=n\u2211(W\u00d7\u03b1)\u200bwhere:W=weight\u00a0assigned\u00a0to\u00a0each\u00a0data\u00a0point\u03b1=alphan=number\u00a0of\u00a0days\u00a0in\u00a0defined\u00a0time\u00a0series\u200b\ufeff\n\nIn a weighted alpha calculation, weights can vary based on preferences or technical analysis software programs. Some weighted alpha calculations may assign weights by quartiles, while others use a standard decreasing weight methodology.\n\nAlpha is often used in conjunction withbeta(the Greek letter \u03b2), which measures the broad market's overallvolatilityor\u00a0risk, known assystematic market risk.\n\nWeighted alpha is used by a variety of investors. Most commonly technical analysts will use weighted alpha as an indicator for supporting buy and sell signals. Technical analysts use this measure to identify companies that have shown a strong trend over the past year and, more specifically, to focus their attention on companies whose momentum is building. When weighted alpha is positive, it can support a bullish buy signal. When weighted alpha is negative, it can support a bearish sell signal.\n\nAs an example, consider a stock that has experienced several highs and lows over the last year through both bullish and bearish trending patterns. A technical analyst using aBollinger Bandchannel may see that the price is approaching its support trendline. If the stock has a positive weighted alpha it can be an affirmation that the stock\u2019s price has largely been gaining over the last year, supporting anotherbullishpush higher.\n\nIn another scenario, a trader may see a stock\u2019s price reaching and beginning to exceed its resistance band in a Bollinger Band channel. Often this is a signal of a reversal and would indicate a sell signal. However, if this security has a positive weighted alpha it is more likely to break beyond its resistance level and move higher. Therefore, the weighted alpha could support a buy trade in this scenario.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
