  "definition": "An oligopsony is a market for a product or service which is dominated by a few large buyers. The concentration of demand in just a few parties gives each substantial power over thesellersand can effectively keep prices down.\n\nThe opposite effect can be seen in anoligopoly. It is a market that is dominated by a few sellers, who can keep prices high in the absence of competition from alternative sources of supply.\n\nThe fast-food industry is a good example of an oligopsony. A small number\u00a0of large buyers including McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's buys a huge amount of the meat produced by American ranchers. That gives the industry the ability to dictate the price they are willing to pay.\n\nCocoa is a less obvious example of an oligopsony.\u00a0Just three firms, including Cargill,\u00a0Archer Daniels Midland, and\u00a0Barry Callebaut, buy most of the world's cocoa bean production, which mostly originates with small farmers in third-world countries.\n\nAmerican\u00a0tobacco\u00a0growers supply an oligopsony of\u00a0cigarette\u00a0makers. Three companies, including Altria,\u00a0Brown & Williamson, and\u00a0Lorillard Tobacco Company, buy nearly 90%\u00a0of all US-grown tobacco and supplement it with tobacco\u00a0produced in other\u00a0countries.\n\nIn American book publishing, consolidation has led to the emergence of just five dominant publishers. Known as the\u00a0Big Five, they\u00a0account for about two-thirds of all books published.\n\nThis is not immediately evident to readers. Each of the publishing giants has absorbed or created a number of specialized\u00a0imprints that cater\u00a0to different market segments and often carry\u00a0the names of formerly independent publishers.\n\nImprints create the illusion that there are many publishers. But they coordinate within the parent company to prevent internal competition\u00a0for manuscripts from popular authors.\n\nThe publishing\u00a0oligopsony also tends to depress advances paid to authors and creates pressure for authors to cater to the tastes of the publishers.\n\nProducers caught in an oligopsony can get caught up in \"racing\u00a0to the bottom,\" with an impact on price and quality.\n\nIn recent years, supermarkets have begun to emerge as an oligopsony. The largest parent company in the industry is now Kroger's, which operates chains including Dillons, Pay-Less Super Markets, Ralphs, and City Market, among many others. The German company Aldi Nord owns not only Aldi's but Trader Joe's.\n\nThis emerging oligopsony is reaching developed economies around the world. As a result, they increasingly influence not only price but what crops are grown and how they are processed and packaged.\n\nThe\u00a0impact of this oligopsony\u00a0reaches\u00a0deep into the lives and livelihoods of agricultural workers around the world.\u00a0Their influence has also forced many suppliers who couldn't compete\u00a0out of business.\u00a0In some countries, this has led to allegations of unethical and illegal conduct.\n\nIn an oligopoly, the control is in the hands of a few sellers. As long as they stay firm on prices, the buyers have little negotiating room.\n\nAn oligopsony market sees frequent price wars as each player works to entice a\u00a0buyer's business. That effectively drives the price a down and the quantity up.\n\nGetting caught in an oligopsony is known as\u00a0\"racing\u00a0to the bottom.\"\u00a0Sellers\u00a0lose\u00a0the power to control supply and demand.",
