The ADA made it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities in terms of employment opportunities, access to transportation, public accommodations, communications, and government activities.\n\nThe ADA prohibits private employers, state and local governments, employment agencies, andlabor unionsfrom discriminating against those who have disabilities. Under the ADA, employers are also required to make reasonable accommodations for an employee with a disability to perform their job function.\n\nTo be covered by the ADA, a person must have a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Four major sections comprise the primary protections introduced by the ADA.\n\nTitle I of the law prohibits discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities duringjob applicationprocedures, hiring, firing, the pursuit of career advancement, compensation, job training, and other aspects of employment. It holds authority over employers who have 15 or more employees.\n\nTitle II applies to state and local government entities. This part of the law further extends the protection from discrimination to qualified individuals with disabilities. It requires that these individuals have reasonable access to services, programs, and activities provided by the government.\n\nTheAmericans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008allowed for a broader legal definition of \u201cdisability.\u201d It made it easier for people seeking protection under the ADA to establish that they have a disability. Before the amendment,\u00a0people with disabilities including cancer, diabetes, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and learning disabilities could be excluded from ADA coverage.\n\nTitle III prohibits discrimination against people with disabilities regarding access to\u00a0activities at public venues. This includes businesses that are generally open to the public, such as restaurants, schools, daycare facilities, movie theaters, recreation facilities, and doctors\u2019 offices.\n\nThe law also requires newly constructed, rebuilt, or refurbished places of public accommodation to comply with ADA standards. In addition, Title III applies to commercial facilities that include privately owned, nonresidential facilities such as factories, warehouses, or office buildings.\n\nTitle IV oversees telephone and television access for individuals with hearing and speech disabilities. Common carriers, such as telephone companies, are required to establish interstate and intrastate telecommunications relay services (TRS) 24 hours a day, seven days a week.\n\nDifferent government agencies play a role in enforcing the ADA.\u00a0TheEqual Employment Opportunity Commission(EEOC) enforces Title I. TheDepartment of Laborenforces state and local government services under Title II and public accommodations under Title III. Title IV is enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).\n\nThe ADA\u00a0established standards for accessible design for public accommodations that include creating automatic doorways, ramps, and elevators to accommodate wheelchairs. Water fountains must be made available at heights that individuals with disabilities can reach.\n\nSome examples of accommodations in the workplace include supplying a hearing-impaired applicant with a sign language interpreter during a job interview, modifying a work schedule to meet the needs of a person who needs treatment, or restructuring an existing facility to make it readily accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nWebsites are required by law to be accessible to people with disabilities and must comply with ADA accessibility standards.\n\nAn employer is not required by the ADA to make reasonable accommodations if doing so presents an undue hardship for the business and requires significant expenses compared with\u00a0the size of the company.\n\nTitle IV of the ADA requires telephone companies to provide telephone relay services, or similar devices, for the hearing- and speech-impaired.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act seeks to prevent discrimination against people with disabilities in the areas of employment, communication, transportation, state and government programs, and public accommodation. It seeks to ensure people with disabilities are able to participate equally in everyday life.\n\nYes, anxiety disorders are covered by the ADA and are considered disabilities. If you suffer from anxiety disorders, you are not allowed to be discriminated against in the workplace or any other area of your life.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is broken down into four main sections: Title I, which covers employment; Title II, which covers public entities and transportation; Title III, which covers public accommodations and public facilities, and Title IV, which covers telecommunications.\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act was passed with the goal of ensuring Americans with disabilities are guaranteed equal opportunities to participate in mainstream life. This includes laws against the discrimination of people with disabilities in regard to employment, transportation, communication, public accommodations, and government activities. The act has done much to further the lives of individuals with disabilities.\n\nADA National Network. \"An Overview of the Americans With Disabilities Act.\"\n\nADA.gov. \u201cA Guide to Disability Rights Laws.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \u201cAmericans with Disabilities Act.\u201d\n\nADA Site Compliance. \"Websites Must Be Accessible According to the ADA.\"",
