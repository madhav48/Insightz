  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nAn investment club refers to a group of people who pool their money to make investments. Usually, investment clubs are organized aspartnerships\u2014after the members study different investments, the group decides to buy or sell based on a majority vote of the members. Club meetings may be educational and each member may actively participate in investment decisions.\n\nInvestment clubs are usually a group of amateur investors who learn about investing by pooling their money and investing it is a group. In the United States, there are two formal definitions of investment clubs that are complimentary. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has defined investment clubs as:\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has also defined investment clubs:\n\nThe IRS goes on to say that investment clubs tend to operate informally, with dues paid regularly (such as monthly). Some clubs employ committees that recommend investments while others involve each member in the process. Clubs subject any actions to a vote by membership. For more information, interested parties can refer to the chapter in IRS Publication 550 on investment clubs.\n\nTheadvantages to investment clubsare that they are the easiest and most economical entities to form, operate, and maintain. Pooling money to do larger market transactions means that the members all enjoy lower transaction fees. The investment club's income and losses are passed through to its partners and are reported on their individual tax returns. Investment clubs are, above all else,a terrific way to learn, make valuable contacts, and meet people interested in the same topics. Some clubs have made significant returns for their members, but even the money losing investment clubs provide important lessons that members will take with them into the future.\n\nWhen setting up an investment club the following steps are recommended:\n\nIn general, investment clubs are unregulated. In United States, the SEC requires any entity with more that $25 million to register under theInvestment Advisers Act of 1940.Individual states may require registration but generally investment clubs do not have to if they have a small number of clients or participants.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, investment clubs are considered unincorporated associations and are not regulated or taxed as corporations. In each case, individual members are responsible for reporting gains and losses on their individual tax returns. In the U.S., income earned by investment club members is treated as partnership pass-through income. As such, members are required to file aForm 1065and aSchedule K-1each year.In the U.K., investment club members are required to fileForm 185 Capital Gains Tax: investment club certificate.\n\nAn investment club usually refers to pooled money being managed by members through an established structure, but there are alternatives that also use the name. Informal investment clubs exist online and in the real world where members simply meet to discuss investing and what they are looking at. The members of these informal investment clubs can then choose whether or not to trade a particular asset that was discussed in their personal portfolio. Moreover, the advent oflow and no fee brokerage accountshave removed one of the key advantages to investment clubs in terms of lower overall commissions and fees. This may well lead more people to join informal investment clubs for the knowledge and insight without the commitment.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investment Clubs and the SEC.\" Accessed Nov. 6, 2020.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550 (2019): Investment Income and Expenses (Including Capital Gains and Losses),\" Pages 25-26.
