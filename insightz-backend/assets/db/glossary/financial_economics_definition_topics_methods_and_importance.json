  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nFinancial economics is a branch of\u00a0economics\u00a0that analyzes the use and distribution of resources inmarkets. Financial decisions must often take into account future events, whether those be related to individual\u00a0stocks,portfolios,\u00a0or the market as a whole.\n\nMaking financial decisions is not always a straightforward process. Time,risk,opportunity costs,\u00a0and information can create incentives and disincentives. Financial economics employs economic theory to evaluate how certain things impact decision-making, providing investors with the instruments to make the right calls.\n\nFinancial economics usually involves the creation of sophisticated models to test the variables affecting a particular decision. Often, these models assume that individuals or institutions making decisions act rationally, though this is not necessarily the case. The irrational behavior of parties has to be taken into account in financial economics as a potential risk factor.\n\nThis branch of economics builds heavily onmicroeconomicsand basic accountingconcepts.It is a quantitative discipline that useseconometricsas well as other mathematical tools.\n\nFinancial economics necessitates familiarity\u00a0with basic probability and statistics since these are the standard tools used to measure and evaluate risk.\n\nFinancial economics studies fair value, risk and returns, and the financing of securities and assets. Numerous monetary factors are taken into account, includinginterest ratesand inflation.\n\nTraditional economics focuses on exchanges in which money is one\u2014but only one\u2014of the items traded. In contrast, financial economics\u00a0concentrates on exchanges in which money of one type or another is likely to appear on both sides of a trade.\n\nThe financial economist can be distinguished from traditional economists by their focus on monetary activities in which\u00a0time,\u00a0uncertainty,\u00a0options,\u00a0and information\u00a0play roles.\n\nThere are many angles to the concept of financial economics.\u00a0Two of the most prominent\u00a0are:\n\nDecision-making over time recognizes the fact that the value of $1 in 10\u00a0years' time is less than the value of $1 now. Therefore, the $1 at 10\u00a0years\u00a0must be discounted to allow for risk,inflation, and the simple fact that it is in the future. Failure to discount appropriately can lead\u00a0to problems, such as underfunded\u00a0pension schemes.\n\nAdvertisements\u00a0for stock market-based financial products must\u00a0remind potential buyers that the value of investments may fall as well as rise.\n\nFinancial institutions are always looking for ways of insuring, orhedging, this risk. It is sometimes possible to hold two highly riskyassetsbut for the overall risk to be low: if share A only performs badly when share B performs well (and vice versa) then the two shares perform a perfect hedge.\n\nAn important part of finance is working out the total risk of a portfolio of risky assets, since the total risk may be less than the risk of the individual components.\n\nFinancial economists analyze economic and monetary trends, particularly as they relate to policy. This work involves tracking and collecting data, forecasting trends, assessing the impact of fiscal and monetary policy, and articulating business strategies to hedge against potential risks.\n\nFinancial economics as a field plays a key role in estimating the potential impacts of events and policy, be they fiscal or monetary. Consider if a central bank increased interest rates, or if Congress passed legislation to issue stimulus payments to the general public. Financial economics would assess how such policies might affect the market.\n\nEconomics and financeare closely intertwined disciplines, but there are key distinctions. Finance is centered primarily on the management of money, and involves assessing different components of financial systems, such as banking, credit, and investments. Economics is a broader and more theoretical realm of study, one that focuses on the production and distribution of resources throughout a society.\n\nFinancial economics is a branch of economics that analyzes the use and distribution of resources in markets. Financial economists evaluate how variables like time, risk, and information should weigh in decision-making. The field considers critical factors including fiscal and monetary policy when calculating potential returns on investments and evaluating whether to invest in certain securities and assets.",
