  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nProration is a type ofcorporate actionthat may arise during an event such as an acquisition, where a company splits its original cash and equity offer in response to shareholder preferences.\n\nIn certain situations, the acquiring firm will offer a combination of cash andequity, and shareholders of the firm being acquired can elect to take either. If available cash or shares are not sufficient to satisfy the offers that shareholders tender, the remaining stock is prorated: the company grants a proportion of both cash and shares for each offer tendered so that everyone gets their fair share of the deal.\n\nProration should not be confused withpro-rata, which indicates some proportional allocation or distribution.\n\nProration supports shareholders by ensuring that a company holds to its initial target and does not favor some investors over others (e.g.,\u00a0giving\u00a0a percentage of shareholders the cash they wanted while delivering shares to the rest). While this means that every investor might not receive their initial election, it ensures that all receive the same value.\n\nOther situations in which the need for proration might occur includebankruptcyor liquidation,special dividends,stock splits, andspinoffs.\n\nWhile these corporate actions must be approved by shareholders, and a company will typically list them on a firm'sproxy statementin advance of its annual meeting, shareholders must occasionally sacrifice to maximize wealth for all shareholders.\n\nMergers occur for several reasons, including to gainmarket sharethrough ahorizontal merger,reduce the costs of operations through a vertical merger, expand to new markets, or unite common products through acongeneric merger. After a merger, shares of the new company are distributed to existing shareholders of both original businesses.\n\nWhen deciding to merge, in addition to how both companies will reward shareholders, it is important to take into consideration the Federal Trade Commission\u2019sguidelineson keeping the industry competitive and avoiding the creation of monopolies.\n\nIt is important to ask whether a proposed merger will create or enhance market power or not. An antitrust concern arises particularly with proposed horizontal mergers between direct competitors.\n\nSuppose a company decides to acquire a rival for $100 million, which consists of 75% cash and 25% equity. The cash-equity split might undergo a revision if a majority of investors of the company being acquired elect to be paid in cash.\n\nIn that case, the acquiring company will change its accounting figures in order to accommodate the demand for cash. This will result in each investor of the acquired company receiving less cash than originally planned. A firm, for example, may have to revise an original offer tobuy back stockand reduce it by a factor of, say two-thirds, in order to balance investor demand and its stock price at that time.\n\nThe proration factor\u00a0refers to the fraction of equity shares accepted by an acquiring company needed for the target company's shareholders to participate in a takeover offer.\n\nProration factor may also refer to the amount of pension eligibility a plan participant is entitled to.\n\nProration can occur if a corporate action is planned, but there is not enough cash available to complete the transaction. Instead, equity shares are used as a form of payment, either in full or in part.\n\nIn business accounting, proration can refer to the logical allocation of over- and under-utilized resources (e.g., finished inventories vs. works-in-progress) that a firm has in order to settle the books at the end of an accounting period.",
