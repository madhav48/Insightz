  "definition": "Madelyn Goodnight / Investopedia\n\nA generation gap refers to the chasm that separates the beliefs and behaviors belonging to members of different generations. This gap often manifests in varying thoughts, actions, and preferences between younger and older generations.\n\nDifferences may exist in politics, values, pop culture, and other areas. While generation gaps have been prevalent throughout history, they became more pronounced in the 20th and 21st centuries due to rapid technological and social changes. Demographic change is one of the most significant yet least understood challenges organizations face today.\n\nGeneration gaps play big roles in businesses. Companies must find ways to balance the needs and views of individuals from different groups to sell to them. Businesses must also be aware of the changing demographics and genders of theirclient base, which can affect theirbusiness cyclesandbottom lines.\n\nThe term \"generation gap\" was first used in the 1960s when Baby Boomers (born 1946-1964) began diverging from their parents' beliefs and opinions.\n\nSociologists use\u00a0specific terminology to refer to different generational segments. For example, Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2012, is known as \u201cdigital natives\u201d because they have grown up with digital technology. In contrast, older generations are termed \"digital immigrants,\" as they're generally less comfortable with personal technology use.Consequently, technology companies tailor their marketing strategies differently for each age group.\n\nGenerational segments go by other handles: The Greatest Generation is also known as \u201cradio babies;\u201d the Silent Generation has also been called \u201ctraditionalists;\u201d and Baby Boomers are also known as the \u201cme generation.\u201d\n\nThe current living generations have been divided into the following six major groups:\n\nEach generation has its own characteristics regarding vernacular, technological influences, workplace attitudes, general consciousness, and ways of life.\n\nAs survirors of theGreat Depressionand World War II, the Greatest Generation played a crucial role in shaping the United States into an economic and military powerhouse.\u00a0Born between 1901 and 1927, this group is characterized by patriotism, strong teamwork, and unwavering drive.\n\nBorn 1928 to 1945, the Silent Generation includes individuals who experienced significant historical events and cultural shifts.\u00a0Older members fought in Korea, while younger ones danced to Elvis Presley and early rock \u2019n\u2019 roll and formed the leadership of the civil rights movement. Often more traditional and rule-following than the Baby Boomers, they're sometimes called the Traditionalist Generation. However, this label might not fully capture this group's diverse experiences and contributions.\n\nBaby Boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, witnessed increasing social and economic equality and came of age during a time of significant division over politics, war, and social justice.\u00a0During the 1960s and '70s, boomers participated in some of the greatest social changes in the country\u2019s history, including the civil rights and women's liberation movements of the 1960s and 70s. Their activism and advocacy during these decades brought about profound changes that continue to influence society today.\n\nThere's speculation that Baby Boomers will significantly change the retirement landscape. Many believe these changes are linked to the countercultural movements of the 1960s and 70s that this generation led. Studies suggest that Baby Boomers who strongly identified with these movements may see retirement as an active phase, involving continued work, personal development, and new ventures.\n\nBorn 1965 to 1980, Gen Xers grew up with emerging technologies and political and institutional challenges.They witnessed significant events such as Watergate, the Three Mile Island incident, and the Iranian hostage crisis.\n\nBut Generation also experienced major technological advancements. For example, fax machines were replaced by email, heavy adding machines gave way to handheld calculators, computers became smaller and faster, DVDs replaced VHS tapes, mobile phones began to appear, and the internet started to transform communication and information access.\n\nBorn between 1981 to 1996, millennials have always known cable TV, pagers, answering machines, laptop computers, and video games. The rapid advancements in real-time media and communication have shaped their expectation for immediacy. They are the generation that bridges the gap between growing up in a world before and after the internet.\n\nThey have also seen untold tragedy in their youth, with events like the Columbine High School shootings of 1999 and the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Additionally, Millennials were deeply impacted by the 2008Great Recession, hurting the long-term outlook of their finances.\n\nThose born on the edge of Gen X and millennials are sometimes referred to as X-ennials.\n\nGeneration Z is the generation after the millennials, born 1997 to 2012. This generation consists of individuals in young adulthood, teenagers, and children. This is the first generation who grew up with the internet as a fact of life, not knowing a world without email, immediate access to information, or mobile phones.\n\nThe cohorts of Gen Z are more likely to be the children of immigrants than millennials are: 22% vs. 14%, respectively.\n\nGeneration Z wasexpected to do well financially, coming of age in a strongeconomy. However, the economic crisis of 2020 disrupted Gen Z's expected financial stability, leaving their future uncertain. As a result, many in this generation are experiencing high levels of stress and depression. According to a study by the American Psychological Association, Gen Z adults report the highest stress levels compared to other generations.\n\nThis generation is racially and ethnically diverse and shares many social and policy beliefs with Millennials. Both generations are progressive, advocating for social equality and emphasizing the importance of addressing climate change.\n\nUnderstanding different generations is critical for businesses to effectively market their products or services. The first step is identifying your target audience based on your business's offerings. From there, learning how tomarketto them without relying on stereotypes is key to success.\n\nStaying true to your company's identity is also essential. If your brand isn\u2019t perceived as hip or young, using trendy language to appeal to Generation Z can appear inauthentic and may backfire.\n\nMillennials and baby boomers are the largest generations.Baby boomers are also the wealthiest, while millennials are reaching middle age and will have morewealthto spend.Understanding these types of characteristics of a generation helps tailor your marketing strategies. For example, Baby Boomers are nearing or enjoyingretirement, so highlighting retirement benefits in your product may resonate with them. Millennials might be more interested in buying a house, their first car, or starting a family.\n\nIn addition, a business needs to know where to market. Baby boomers grew up without smartphones or the internet. Though many are tech-savvy, many also still read physical newspapers and watch cable TV. If you're marketing to baby boomers, that might be an area to consider.\n\nOn the other hand, Generation Z grew up with smartphones and tablets, so digital marketing is the best approach to engage this tech-savvy audience.\n\nA generation gap is the thoughts, beliefs, and ideologies that separate one generation from the next. These can encompass beliefs on politics, business, race, and pop culture.\n\nGeneration gaps are simply caused by age and the situation of the world at the time when one generation has grown up. For example, the beliefs and perceptions of those who grew up during World War II may be different from those who grew up in the 1960s\u2014though to be sure, similarities will remain.\n\nSome of the different generation gaps are the Traditionalists, the Baby Boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and Generation Z.\n\nThere are many studies conducted on this topic. There will always be different generations, simply because people are born at different times. Similarly, the world and society are always changing, which will inadvertently change the perception of individuals depending on the period they grew up in. Studies also show that the differences in generation gaps are minimal. Individual differences also play a role, as do socioeconomic factors.\n\nThere are ways to bridge the generation gap in certain workplace situations. Encouraging multigenerational teamwork is one tactic. Creating clear cultural values, such as highlighting the importance of the quality of the work rather than where the work is done (office vs. remotely), is another. Incorporating many communication channels that work for all individuals, organizing mentorship programs, and emphasizing respect above all else are also useful tools.\n\nA generation gap consists of the differing beliefs on politics, religion, society, and pop culture that exist between different generations. These beliefs are shaped by the state of the world in which the individuals belonging to each generation grew up.\n\nBusinesses often try to understand the different generations so that they can create and market products successfully. Businesses also try and understand these differences to close the generation gap among employees, hopefully building cohesive and efficient workplaces.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Bridging Generational Divides in Your Workplace.\"\n\nBeresford Research. \"Generations defined by name, birth year, and ages in 2024.\"\n\nAcademia. \u201cUnderstanding Generation Gap at Work Place,\u201d Page 56.\n\nUniversity of Massachusetts Global. \u201c3 Generation Z Traits Today\u2019s Teachers Need to Adapt to.\u201d\n\nUniversity of South Florida, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cGenerational Differences Chart,\u201d Page 1.\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cDefining Generations: Where Millennials End and Generation Z Begins.\u201d\n\nThe Center for Generational Kinetics. \u201cGenerational Breakdown: Info About All of the Generations.\u201d\n\nMissouri Senate, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cThe Greatest Generation.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cThe Generations Defined.\u201d\n\nEmeritus College, Arizona State University. \u201cGeneration Who: Connecting with Our Youth.\u201d\n\nEmeritus College, Arizona State University. \u201cThe Silent Generation.\u201d\n\nEducation Resources Information Center. \u201cBoomers, Xers, and Millennials: Who Are They and What Do They Really Want from Continuing Higher Education?,\u201d Pages 14\u201315 (Pages 4\u20135 of PDF).\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"Children of the Revolution: The Impact of 1960s and 1970s Cultural Identification on Baby Boomers\u2019 Views on Retirement.\"\n\nEducation Resources Information Center. \u201cBoomers, Xers, and Millennials: Who Are They and What Do They Really Want from Continuing Higher Education?,\u201d Pages 15\u201317 (Pages 5\u20137 of PDF).\n\nUniversity System of Georgia. \"A Brief History of the Internet.\"\n\nOld Dominion University. \"History of Phones.\"\n\nMath Science History. \"The History of Calculators.\"\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT Graduate Program in Comparative Media Studies. \u201c20th Century Media and the American Psyche: Chapter 1,\u201d Page 3.\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cOn the Cusp of Adulthood and Facing an Uncertain Future: What We Know About Gen Z So Far.\u201d\n\nAmerican Psychological Association. \"Stress in America: A National Mental Health Crisis.\"\n\nPew Research Center. \u201cMillennials Overtake Baby Boomers as America\u2019s Largest Generation.\u201d\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \u201cDFA: Distributional Financial Accounts: Distribution of Household Wealth in the U.S. Since 1989,\u201d select Units: Levels ($).",
