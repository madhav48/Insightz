  "definition": "Jobs growth is measured in the U.S. by the number of employees added tononfarm payrollsmonthly, as reported by theBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). It is a key indicator of the pace of economic expansion. Nonfarm payrolls are part of the Employment Situation Summary published by the BLS, the widely followed statistical release better known as the monthly jobs report.\n\nJobs growth refers to the net increase in the number of nonfarm payrolls during the previous month. This number is widely followed becauseemploymentis crucial for economic performance. Bigger gains suggest growth above the trend, while smaller ones or outright losses may signal a slowdown.\n\nThat said, it is important to remember that the growth in the Employment Situation Summary is only an estimate. The numbers for a given month are revised in each of the next two monthly reports based on additional survey submissions. A monthly nonfarm payroll increase of about 130,000 is considered statistically significant.\n\nThe increase of nonfarm payroll employment in December 2024. The unemployment rate, which is derived from a separate survey, changed little at 4.1%. Employment trended upin health care, government, and social assistance. Retail trade added jobs in December, following a job loss in November.\n\nThe BLS compiles job growth data by surveying about 119,000 businesses and government agencies accounting for about 20% of total U.S. nonfarm employment. The Employment Situation Summary provides data from this establishment survey tracking nonfarm employment by industry as well as a separate household survey of employment status. The two surveys provide headline-making figures on job growth andunemployment.\n\nAlthough nonfarm payrolls are subtotaled by industry, the most commonly reported number is the net change in U.S. payrolls from the preceding month, which estimates the number of jobs added outside the agricultural sector.\u00a0Farm employment is excluded from the establishment survey because it is tooseasonaland harder to estimate.\n\nBecause of how important it is to the economy, job growth is closely watched by the Federal Reserve as it makes changes to its monetary policy.\n\nAs a comprehensive measure of U.S. employment and one of the earliest economic reports for a given month, the Employment Situation Summary often moves financial markets. In addition to tallying nonfarm payrolls, the establishment survey estimates average weekly hours worked\u2014a measure oflabor demand\u2014as well as average hourly earnings, an early indicator oflabor cost inflation.\n\nBecause of the report's importance to investors and policymakers, traders compare the numbers in it to the consensus of analysts'forecaststo get an early sense of whether, for example, nonfarm payroll gains in the latest month exceeded or trailed market expectations.\n\nSince the numbers fluctuate from month to month and are subject to significant revisions, it takes more than a single report to establish atrend. Investors must also consider this metric in the context of other economic indicators. Despite those limitations, the monthly jobs growth figure remains a key indicator of how the economy is faring.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics gets job growth data from a survey of 119,000 businesses and government agencies, which account for about 20% of the total U.S. nonfarm employment.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the fastest-growing jobs from 2023 to 2033 include wind turbine service technicians, solar photovoltaic installers, nurse practitioners, data scientists, information security analysts, medical and health services managers, and physician assistants.\n\nTotal U.S. employment is expected to grow by approximately 6.7 million jobs from 2023 to 2033. Total employment till then is expected to grow 0.4% annually, which is slower than the 1.3% annual growth in the previous decade from 2013 to 2023. A large part of this is due to the slowing growth in the population and a reduction in the labor force participation rate due to the aging of the baby boomer generation.\n\nJobs growth refers to the number of nonfarm payroll jobs added to the economy in a month. It is a leading indicator of the health of the economy. The more jobs added indicate a healthier economy.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Frequently Asked Questions about Employment and Unemployment Estimates.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"THE EMPLOYMENT SITUATION \u2014 DECEMBER 2024,\" Page 1.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Monthly Employment Situation Report: Quick Guide to Methods and Measurement Issues.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Nonfarm Payrolls: Why Farmers Aren\u2019t Included in Jobs Data.\"\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"How Does the Federal Reserve Affect Inflation and Employment?\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Current Employment Statistics - CES (National): CES Overview.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Fastest Growing Occupations.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Employment Projections: 2023-2033 Summary.\"",
