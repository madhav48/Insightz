  "term": "Trade Liberalization: Definition, How It Works, and Example",
  "definition": "Trade liberalization refers to the removal or reduction of restrictions or barriers on the free exchange of goods between nations.\n\nSuch barriers could includetariffs, such as duties and surcharges, and non-tariff barriers, such as licensing rules andquotas.\n\nEconomists often view\u00a0the easing or eradication of these restrictions as steps to promote free trade.\n\nTrade liberalization is a controversial topic. Critics of trade liberalization claim that the policy can cost jobs because cheaper goods will flood the nation's domestic market.\n\nCritics also suggest that the imported goods can be of inferior quality and less safe than competing domestic products that may have undergone more rigorous safety and quality checks.\n\nProponents of trade liberalization, however, claim that it\u00a0ultimately lowers consumer costs, increases efficiency, and fosterseconomic growth.\n\nProtectionism, the opposite of trade liberalization, is characterized by\u00a0strict barriers and market regulation.\n\nThe outcome of trade liberalization and the resulting integration among countries worldwide is known asglobalization.\n\nTrade liberalization promotesfree trade, which allows countries to trade goods\u00a0without regulatory barriers and their associated costs.\n\nThis reduced regulation decreases costs for countries that trade with other nations and\u00a0may, ultimately,\u00a0result in lower consumer prices because imports are subject to\u00a0lower fees and competition is likely to increase.\n\nIncreased competition from abroad as a result of trade liberalization creates an incentive for greater efficiency and cheaper production by domestic firms.\n\nThis competition might also spur a country to shift resources to\u00a0industries in which it may have acompetitive advantage.\n\nFor example, trade liberalization has encouraged\u00a0the United Kingdom to concentrate on its service sector rather than manufacturing.\n\nHowever, trade liberalization can negatively affect certain businesses within a nation because of greater competition from foreign producers. It may result in less\u00a0local support for those industries.\n\nThere may also be a financial and social risk if products or raw materials come from countries with lower environmental standards.\n\nTrade liberalization can\u00a0pose a threat to developing nations or economies because they are forced to compete in the same market as stronger economies or nations.\n\nThis challenge can stifle established local industries or result in the failure of newly developed industries there.\n\nCountries with advanced education systems tend to adapt\u00a0rapidly to a free-trade economy because they have a labor market that can\u00a0adjust to changing demands and production facilities that can\u00a0shift their focus to more in-demand goods.\n\nCountries with lower educational standards may struggle to\u00a0adapt\u00a0to a\u00a0changing economic environment.\n\nCritics believe that trade liberalization costs jobs and depresses wages. Proponents believe it spurs competition and growth.\n\nTheNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)was signed on Dec. 17, 1992, by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It entered into force on Jan. 1, 1994.\n\nThe agreement eliminated the tariffs on products that were traded among the three countries. One of NAFTA's goals was to integrate Mexico with the highly developed economies of the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThis was in part because Mexico was considered a lucrative new market for those two nations.\n\nThe three governments also hoped that the trade deal would improve Mexico's economy.Over time, regional trade tripled, and cross-border investment increased among the countries.\n\nHowever, President Donald Trump considered the agreement detrimental to U.S. jobs and manufacturing.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 2018, the Trump administration concluded negotiations on an updated pact, theU.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which entered into force on July 1, 2020.Among other things, it was intended to protect U.S. workers against job losses.\n\nMost economists agree that NAFTA was beneficial to the Canadian and U.S. economies. According to a Council on Foreign Relations report, regional trade increased from $290 billion in 1993 to over $1.1 trillion in 2016.\n\nU.S.foreign direct investment (FDI)stock in Mexico increased from $15 billion to more than $100 billion.\n\nHowever, economists also say that other factors may have contributed to these outcomes, such as technological change and extended trade with China.\n\nCritics of NAFTA argue that the agreement caused job losses and wage stagnation in the U.S. because companies moved their production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs.\n\nThe ability of the USMCA to counter these factors is still being studied.\n\nTrade liberalization can be advantageous, in that it typically results in lower prices for consumer goods and greater opportunity to pursue business abroad. However, increased competition can also pose new challenges for domestic firms, potentially resulting in job or business losses.\n\nIn general, the term \"liberalization\" refers to policies that loosen or relinquish government control over a sector. Hence, trade liberalization takes place when a government reduces oversight and management of international trade.\n\nBecause trade liberalization can represent a major economic shift in relations among countries, there are numerous ways different stakeholders can benefit. For consumers, trade liberalization might bring down the cost of goods, as manufactured imports may be significantly cheaper than domestically produced counterparts. For businesses, trade liberalization can translate to opportunities to do business abroad and earn more revenue. However, these benefits are not always guaranteed, and how exactly trade liberalization affects the economy depends on the specifics of any particular agreement.\n\nTrade liberalization refers to policies and programs that reduce barriers to trade among countries. This can include free trade agreements that eliminate tariffs and duties.\n\nIt can also mean the elimination or adjustment of rules, such as domestic production quotas or licensing restrictions.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The North American Free Trade Agreement,\" Page 1.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations. \"NAFTA and the USMCA: Weighing the Impact of North American Trade.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement,\" Page 1.",
