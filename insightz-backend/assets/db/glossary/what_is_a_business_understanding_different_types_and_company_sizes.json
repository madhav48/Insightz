A business plan is a formal document that outlines the company's goals and objectives. It lists the strategies and plans to achieve these goals and objectives.\n\nBusiness plans are essential when you want to borrowcapitalto begin operations.\n\nDetermining the legal structure of the business is an important factor to consider, since business owners may need to secure permits and licenses and follow registration requirements to begin legal operations.\n\nCorporations are considered to be juridical persons in many countries, meaning that the business can own property, take ondebt, and be sued in court.\n\nMost businesses operate to generate aprofit, commonly called for-profit. However, some businesses that have a goal to advance a certain cause without profit are referred to as not-for-profit or nonprofit.\n\nThese entities may operate as charities, arts, culture, educational, and recreational enterprises, political and advocacy groups, or social services organizations.\n\nBusiness activities often include the sale and purchase of goods and services.

For example, ExxonMobil conducts its business by providing oil.\n\nA good name is often one of the most valuable assets of a business, so it's important that business owners choose their names wisely.\n\nThere are many ways to organize a business, and there are various legal and tax structures that correspond with each. Businesses are commonly classified and generally structured as one of the following:\n\nSmall owner-operated companies are called small businesses. Commonly managed by one person or a small group of people with less than 100 employees, these companies include family restaurants, home-based companies, clothing, books, and publishing companies, and small manufacturers.\n\nAs of 2024, 34.8 million small businesses operated in the United States, with 59 million employees.\n\nTheSmall Business Administration (SBA)uses the number of employees working at a company and its annual revenue to formally define a small business.\n\nFor 229 industry sectors, from engineering and manufacturing to food service and real estate, the SBA reviews sizing standards every five years and considers whether to change them.\n\nBusinesses that meet the standards of the SBA can qualify for loans, grants, and \"small business set-asides,\" contracts where the federal government limits competition to help small businesses compete for and win federal contracts.\n\nThere is no definitive specification in the U.S. for a mid-sized or medium-sized company.\n\nHowever, when large U.S. cities such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Boston evaluate the landscape of operating businesses, a medium-sized company is defined as one with 100 to 249 employees or $10 million to less than $1 billion in annualgross sales.\n\nLarge businesses commonly have 250 or more employees and garner more than $1 billion in gross receipts.They may issue corporate stock to finance operations as apublicly-tradedcompany.\n\nLarge enterprises may be based in one country and have international operations. They are often organized by departments, such as human resources, finance, marketing, sales, and research and development.\n\nUnlike small and mid-sized enterprises, which can be owned by a person or group of people, large organizations often separate their tax burden from their owners. An elected board of directors enacts most business decisions.\n\nApple(AAPL) is known for its innovative products, including its personal computers, smart devices, and music and video streaming services.\n\nThe business was founded in 1977 bySteve Jobsand Steve Wozniak. In 2018, Apple became the first publicly-traded company whose value hit $1 trillion.On May 15, 2025, its market capitalization was $3.15 trillion.\n\nThe company claims job creation for over two million people, including 80,000 individuals who work directly for Apple and 450,000 jobs held by suppliers and manufacturers. TheApp Storehas generated more than 1.5 million jobs.\n\nThe company reported net sales of $391.03 billion for the 12 months ending Sept. 24, 2024.\n\nApple's key to successlies in its family of products and its ability to innovate. The company focuses on design and quality\u2014two key elements that were a key part of Jobs' corporate vision.\n\nThe products that Apple creates and markets can have the same operating system, which allows consumers to sync all of their Apple devices. This lowers corporate costs and satisfies customers.\n\nApple's ability to create, develop, and market new products and services also put it ahead of its competition.\n\nWalmart(WMT) is one of the world's largest retailers and operates as amultinational corporation. The company was founded in 1962 by Sam Walton in Arkansas.\n\nIt has more than 10,750 locations in more than 19 countries and employs over 2.1 million people.\n\nThe company went public in 1970 and trades on theNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Walmart stock had a market cap of $770.88 billion in May 2025.\n\nThe company earned $648.12 billion in total revenues for the 2024fiscal year, which was an increase of 6% year-over-year.\n\nWalmart's success can be attributed to several factors, including its brand name, pricing, diversification (especially with the addition of its online marketplace), efficientsupply chain management, and its financial strength.\n\nThere are several steps you need to hurdle to start a business. This includes conducting market research, developing a business plan, seeking capital or other forms of funding, choosing a location and business structure, picking the right name, submitting registration paperwork, obtaining tax documents (employer and taxpayer IDs), and pulling permits and licenses. It's also a good idea to set up a bank account with a financial institution to facilitate your everyday banking needs.\n\nStarting an online business involves some of the same steps as a traditional business, with a few exceptions.\n\nYou still need to do your market research and develop a business plan before anything else. Once that's done, choose a name and structure for your business, then file any paperwork to register your organization.\n\nRather than finding a physical location, choose a platform and design your website. Before launching your business, you should find a way to build up your target market, whether that's through traditional marketing means or more creative ways like social media.\n\nYour business name should fit the type of organization you plan to run and it should be catchy\u2014something that people will gravitate toward and remember, not to mention associate with you as well as the products and services you plan to sell. Originality is key. And most importantly, it should be a name that isn't already in use by someone else. Go online and do a business name search to see if it's available or already registered.\n\nBusiness plans are essential to running your business and can help you secure the funding you need to start your operations. You can choose between a traditional or lean plan.\n\nA traditional business plan has a lot of details, including a summary of the company, how it plans to succeed, market information, management, products and services, marketing, and sales projections.\n\nLean formats are concise with very useful information such as partnership details, outlines of the business activities and customer relationships, cost structures, and revenue streams.\n\nTemplates are available online or you can design your own business plan.\n\nNecessary funding for a business often comes via a loan. A traditional lender or a government-backed loan, such as those offered through the Small Business Administration, are two options. Prospective lenders want to see business details, especially for newstart-ups. Make sure you have your business plan ready, including outlines of costs and revenue streams, and ensure you have a good credit score. You may need to put down some collateral to secure the loan if you're approved.\n\nBusinesses are the backbone of an economy. They provide products and services that can be purchased by individuals and other companies.\n\nBusinesses range in size from small to large and operate in many different industries. Business structures also vary, from sole partnerships to major corporations that provide shareholder equity to their owners.\n\nWhen starting a business, do your research and develop a business plan.
