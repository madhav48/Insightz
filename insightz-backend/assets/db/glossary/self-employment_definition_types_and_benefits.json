  "definition": "Self-employment simply means working for yourself rather than for an employer.\n\nThe Arizona Department of Economic Security defines self-employment as \"working for oneself rather than for an employer.\"The self-employed perform work for pay that comes from clients and customers rather than an employer. They may devote their time to one client or customer or several.\n\nAself-employed workercan incorporate or establish and work as another legal business entity but it's not required. Also, licensure isn't necessary unless their business or occupation mandates it.\n\nThe United States was home to more than 16.3 million self-employed individuals as of January 2025, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nA self-employed worker typically possesses talents or skills or offers services to others. Lawyers, particularly those who establish solo law firms, are often self-employed.\n\nMoreover, even if they work at a law firm as partners, they are not employees but rather self-employed. A lawyer would become an employee, however, if a firm hired them as associates rather than partners.\n\nOther self-employed professions includefreelancers, artists, writers,real estate agents, repairpersons, and even office and secretarial staff who sell their abilities as needed.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides guidance about the difference between self-employed workers and employees. In particular, for self-employed workers:\n\nSelf-employed individuals are classified as either independent contractors or sole proprietors. They may or may not have employees.\n\nAnindependent contractorperforms a specific job for a specific client. As the \"independent\" part of the name implies, they do so on their own terms.\n\nA homeowner might have a structural problem with their house that requires expert repair. They might pay an independent contractor who will care for the problem on a date and at a time determined by the contractor.\n\nThe work would be performed for a fee that the contractor determines. The contractor would use their tools and equipment.\n\nThey're compensated for a single job. The homeowner won't withhold taxes from their payment or provide employment-associated benefits such as worker's compensation.\n\nAsole proprietoris the sole owner of an unincorporated business. They can and often do hire employees to assist with daily operations. The owner of alimited liability companycan fall into this category, provided that they don't incorporate their business.\n\nSelf-employment might be your calling if you're a free spirit. You don't like saluting others or having a boss who controls your time. You want to do things your way, on your terms, and according to your timing.\n\nA self-employed worker doesn't have to take on a job if it doesn't appeal to them. However, the odds are that you truly enjoy the work you perform or you wouldn't be doing it.\n\nFurthermore, unlike a salaried worker, self-employment offers no cap on income potential.\n\nAll in all, self-employment offers several attractive benefits to those who fit the mold.\n\nSelf-employment may not be right for you if financial security is high on your list of must-haves.\n\nYou might depend heavily on a regular paycheck but that income could be non-existent if no one hires you to do a job every week. Having working capital or someemergency savingsset aside can be key for the self-employed.\n\nSometimes, a client or customer won't pay a contractor after finishing their work. So, it's best to arrange for payment upfront before you perform a job.\n\nIn addition, self-employed people have to spend time marketing themselves (or pay someone else to do so) to keep income flowing. And, you must pay for your supplies and equipment as well.\n\nEmployers have a great deal of control over your life but they also can take a few burdensome financial tasks and responsibilities off your hands.\n\nFor example, many employers offeroptions for health insurance coverageand contribute to the cost. They may provide paid sick time and vacation time or family leave coverage. Plus, they may offer a retirement plan that helps you save for the future and contribute to it on your behalf.\n\nHowever, for many self-employed workers, perhaps the greatest financial consideration is that they are solely responsible for keeping the IRS and their state's tax department happy.\n\nSelf-employed independent contractorsmust make quarterly tax paymentsthroughout the year.An employer isn't available to withhold these taxes from their pay.\n\nThe tax filing process is much the same as submittingForm 1040if you were an employee, except that you must attach Schedule C enumerating your business income and available deductions.\n\nAnd yes, you canclaim certain deductionsthat employees aren't privy to, such as for your home office space and any business-associated miles you put on your vehicle.\n\nBe sure to save your bank statements and carefully track cash payments. Ongoing clients might provide a Form 1099 showing how much they paid you for the year. This form is submitted to the IRS as well.\n\nYour filed tax return can also serve as proof of income if you find that you want to apply for a mortgage or other loan.\n\nOf course, whether you're an independent contractor or a sole proprietor, you can always hire a tax professional to take care of tax issues for you.\n\nThere's one last financial wrinkle to self-employment: theself-employment tax. Not only are you required to pay estimated income taxes quarterly but you must also pay the full boat on Social Security and Medicare taxes.\n\nEmployees get a break here. They pay half of these taxes, and their employers pay the other half.\n\nHowever, the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) states that a self-employed individual is both an employee and an employer. Therefore, they must pay both halves or 15.3%. This works out to 12.4% of earnings going to Social Security and 2.9% going toMedicare.\n\nBut here's some good news: They're entitled to a tax deduction in the amount of the employer's portion when they file their annual tax return.\n\nOnly $176,100 of your income is subject to the Social Security tax in 2025, just as is the case for employed taxpayers. This threshold is adjusted annually to keep pace with inflation.\n\nSelf-employment has many pros and cons. It might be a perfect fit for you if you don't like answering to anyone, you have financial nerves of steel, and you don't mind rolling up your sleeves to take care of your own marketing, financial books, and tax obligations.\n\nIt's on you to snag that next job to keep your finances rolling along but that may not be a hardship if you love what you do and you're good at it.\n\nArizona Department of Economic Security. \"Self-Employment Definition.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"The Employment Situation: Table A-9.
