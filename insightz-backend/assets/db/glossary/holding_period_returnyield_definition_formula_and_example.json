  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nHolding period return is thetotal returnreceived from holding an asset orportfolioof assets over a period of time, known as theholding period. It is generally expressed as a percentage and is particularly useful for comparing returns on investments purchased at different periods in time.\n\nHolding period return is calculated on thebasis of total returns from the asset or portfolio(income plus changes in value). It is particularly useful for comparing returns between investmentsheld for different periods of time.\n\nStarting on the day after the security's acquisition and continuing until the day of its disposal or sale, the holding period determines tax implications. For example, Sarah bought 100 shares of stock on Jan. 2, 2023. When determining her holding period, she begins counting on Jan. 3, 2023. The third day of each month after that counts as the start of a new month, regardless of how many days each month contains.\n\nIf Sarah sold her stock on Dec. 23, 2023, she would realize a short-term capital gain orcapital\u00a0lossbecause her holding period is less than one year. If she sells her stock on Jan. 3, 2024, she would realize a long-term capital gain or loss because her holding period is more than one year.\n\nHolding Period Return (HPR) and annualized HPR for returns over multiple years can be calculated as follows:\n\nHoldingPeriodReturn=Income+(EndOfPeriodValue\u2212InitialValue)InitialValue\\begin{aligned}&\\textit{Holding Period Return}\\\\&\\qquad=\\frac{\\textit{Income }+(\\textit{End Of Period Value }-\\textit{ Initial Value})}{\\textit{Initial Value}} \\end{aligned}\u200bHolding\u00a0Period\u00a0Return=Initial\u00a0ValueIncome+(End\u00a0Of\u00a0Period\u00a0Value\u2212Initial\u00a0Value)\u200b\u200b\n\nReturns computed for regular time periods such as quarters or years can be converted to a holding period return as well.\n\nThe following are some examples of calculating holding period return:\n\n1. What is the HPR for aninvestorwho bought a stock a year ago at $50 and received $5 individendsover the year if the stock is now trading at $60?\n\nHPR=5+(60\u221250)50=30%\\begin{aligned}HPR=\\frac{5+(60-50)}{50}=30\\%\\end{aligned}HPR=505+(60\u221250)\u200b=30%\u200b\n\n2. Which investment performed better:Mutual FundX, which was held for three years and appreciated from $100 to $150, providing\u00a0$5 in distributions, or Mutual Fund B, which went from $200 to $320 and generated $10 indistributionsover four years?\n\nHPRforFundX=5+(150\u2212100)100=55%HPRforFundB=10+(320\u2212200)200=65%\\begin{aligned}&\\textit{HPR for Fund X}=\\frac{5+(150-100)}{100}=55\\%\\\\[+.010pt]&\\textit{HPR for Fund B}=\\frac{10+(320-200)}{200}=65\\%\\end{aligned}\u200bHPR\u00a0for\u00a0Fund\u00a0X=1005+(150\u2212100)\u200b=55%HPR\u00a0for\u00a0Fund\u00a0B=20010+(320\u2212200)\u200b=65%\u200b\n\nNote: Fund B had the higher HPR, but it was held for four years, as opposed to the three years for which Fund X was held. Since the time periods are different, this requires annualized HPR to be calculated, as shown below.\n\n3. Calculation of annualized HPR:\n\nAnnualizedHPRforFundX=(0.55+1)1/3\u22121=15.73%AnnualizedHPRforFundB=(0.65+1)1/4\u22121=13.34%\\begin{aligned}&\\textit{Annualized HPR for Fund X}\\\\&\\qquad=(0.55+1)^{1/3}-1=15.73\\%\\\\&\\textit{Annualized HPR for Fund B}\\\\&\\qquad=(0.65+1)^{1/4}-1=13.34\\%\\end{aligned}\u200bAnnualized\u00a0HPR\u00a0for\u00a0Fund\u00a0X=(0.55+1)1/3\u22121=15.73%Annualized\u00a0HPR\u00a0for\u00a0Fund\u00a0B=(0.65+1)1/4\u22121=13.34%\u200b\n\nThus, despite having the lower HPR, Fund X was the superior investment.\n\n4. Your stock portfolio had the following returns in the four quarters of a given year: +8%, -5%, +6%, +4%. How did it compare against thebenchmarkindex, which had total returns of 12% over the year?\n\nHPRforyourstockportfolio=[(1+0.08)\u00d7(1\u22120.05)\u00d7(1+0.06)\u00d7(1+0.04)]\u22121=13.1%\\begin{aligned}&\\textit{HPR for your stock portfolio}\\\\&\\qquad=[(1+0.08)\\times(1-0.05)\\times(1+0.06)\\times(1+0.04)]\\\\&\\qquad\\quad-1=13.1\\%\\end{aligned}\u200bHPR\u00a0for\u00a0your\u00a0stock\u00a0portfolio=[(1+0.08)\u00d7(1\u22120.05)\u00d7(1+0.06)\u00d7(1+0.04)]\u22121=13.1%\u200b\n\nYour portfolio, therefore, outperformed the index by more than a percentage point. (However, the risk of the portfolio should also be compared to that of the index to evaluate if the added return was generated by taking significantly higher risk.)\n\nPretty much, yes. The rate of return tells us, in percentage terms, how much an investment made or lost. The holding period return does the same thing, telling us the return on an investment during the timeframe it was held.\n\nHolding period return is important for several reasons. It considers not only appreciation but also income payments and is a great way to compare the performance of investments held over different timeframes.\n\nHolding period means the time a security was held for. It begins when the investment is purchased and ends when it is sold.\n\nYes. Not all investments generate a profit. Even a stock that pays a dividend could deliver a negative holding period return if it depreciated in value.\n\nA holding period return is the total return you received from holding an asset or collection of assets. You essentially subtract the price you initially paid from the price you sold the security, add any income paid, and then divide the sum by the initial value. The holding period of return is usually expressed as a percentage, meaning you then multiply the total by 100.\n\nKnowing the holding period return makes it easier to compare returns between investments. That\u2019s especially the case for investments held for different periods of time.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 409 Capital Gains and Losses.\"",
