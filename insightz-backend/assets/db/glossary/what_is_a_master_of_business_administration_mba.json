  "term": "What Is a Master of Business Administration (MBA)?",
  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA master of business administration (MBA) is a graduate degree that provides theoretical and practical training for business or investment management. An MBA is designed to help graduates gain a better understanding of business management functions.\n\nAn MBA degree can have a general focus or a specific focus in fields such as accounting, finance, marketing, and international business.\n\nAn MBA is a level up from an undergraduate business degree and generally places the graduate well above those with only undergraduate degrees. Most major universities and colleges provide MBA programs, which usually last two years.\n\nTo get into an MBA program, an applicant needs to take theGraduate Management Admission Test (GMAT)and be accepted by the program based on its particular selection criteria. Some programs may require the GRE instead or accept it as an alternative standardized test.\n\nMBA programs typically include core classes inaccounting, management, finance,marketing, and business law. Management training is at the heart of any MBA curriculum, with a focus on leadership, planning, business strategy, organizational behavior, and the more human sides of running a large orsmall business.\n\nIncreasingly, MBA programs include training in international business and a focus on the responsibilities and corporate accountability of businesses within their communities.\n\nThe MBA degree is the most common route into certain fields, including strategic planning andprivate equity. Other financial services fields, however, may no longer consider an MBA an entry-level degree.Each company will have its own requirementsfor different positions. But MBAs can certainly help distinguish candidates.\n\nIt is not uncommon to gain professional experience before applying to an MBA program. Many programs require a work resum\u00e9 and demonstration of real world experience prior to joining the program. Other programs may be suitable for candidates straight out of college.\n\nMBA programs will vary between disciplines, specialties, and schools. It is highly likely that most MBA candidates will be able to find an educational solution that works with their schedule, interests, and time commitment restraints.\n\nOne of the most common type of MBA program involves a two-year commitment during which candidates attend school full time. During the first year of the program, MBA candidates may learn fundamental business skills such as strategy or communication. It's normal for candidates to choose more specific electives during the program's second year.\n\nAlthough it requires a substantial amount of time, a two-year program allows candidates to pursue aninternshipbetween the years. The longer duration is also intended to help foster relationships between classmates and give candidates more time to absorb materials.\n\nAccelerated programs crunch a two-year program into a single year. Better for candidates that don't want to spend too much time away from work, this type of MBA program is more intensive, faster paced, and often must sacrifice content quantity.\n\nDuring a one-year full-time MBA program, candidates may still learn general business skills while selecting specialized electives. However, less time may be dedicated to either group due to the condensed nature of the coursework. One-year programs are often chosen by students trying to accelerate their current career paths as opposed to jumping to different ones.\n\nStudents not looking to leave work and willing to attend school for a longer time may pursue a part-time MBA program. This type of program often offers greater flexibility related to how many courses can be taken at once and how quickly a student must move through the program.\n\nPart-time programs may be more favorable for candidates wanting to study at their own pace. In addition, part-time programs may be better suited based on lifestyle demands (e.g., a single parent may only be able to attend classes during a certain time of the day). Part-time programs may offer the flexibility of evening or weekend classes, allowing candidates to balance part-time, freelance, orgig economywork.\n\nOne type of MBA program that overlaps with the options above is an online MBA. Often a two-year, one-year, or part-time choice, an online MBA allows students to attend school remotely.\n\nThis type of MBA program grants candidates even greater flexibility concerning when they take classes and how they attend school. Online programs may also have different approaches to fostering collaboration compared to in-person programs.\n\nSome MBA programs focus on global operations. Candidates interested in a wider focus and who want to branch out from just domestic companies or segments of a company might choose an international program.\n\nAn international MBA can help candidates build an international network and develop opportunities around the world. International MBA candidates may be more diverse than traditional or domestic MBAs, especially if the international MBA offers online classes.In addition, international MBA programs may be better suited to candidates preparing to work in amultinational corporation.\n\nSpecialized MBA programs are also available for students whose lives and careers do not permit them to attend school full time.\n\nFor example,executive MBAprograms are designed for working professionals hoping to add to their credentials and qualifications. These courses of study typically involve classes at night and on weekends. Some also may require short residencies of intensive coursework.\n\nExecutive MBA programs are typically only open to candidates who already have substantial professional experience. Thus, they tend to focus on more advanced topics such as leadership development.\n\nWhile MBA candidates can focus on one of the core disciplines of the degree, such as management or finance, many MBA programs allow students to concentrate in specific industries. For example, an MBA student might specialize in sports management, entrepreneurship, the entertainment business, or healthcare management.\n\nEven within a management specialty, MBA programs can allow for a concentration on information technology, hospitality, education, or criminal justice. Some MBA programs team up with various professional healthcare programs, such as nursing schools, to offer joint degrees.\n\nMBA programs have different length of study requirements. For example, a degree at Franklin University requires 36-60 credit hours, while the University of Nebraska Omaha program is comprised of 33 credit hours.\n\nThe most prestigious MBA programs are nicknamed \"M7 MBA Programs\". They are offered by these schools:\n\nAcceptance by an M7 school is considered more difficult than acceptance by non-M7 schools. In addition, tuition is substantially higher at M7 schools, though financial assistance is usually available in the form of financial aid, fellowships, or sponsorships.\n\nBroadly speaking, an MBA gives degree holders two uses: accelerated advancement in the career they are already pursuing or a strong pivot in a new direction with a newfound skillset.\n\nThe Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania communicates the following benefits and uses of an MBA to its prospective candidates:\n\nOver the past two decades, a growing number of Americans have prioritized higher education. In 2021, 24.1 million U.S. citizens age 25 and over obtained a master's degree (not necessarily an MBA). That's more than eight million citizens since 2011.\n\nEvery MBA program will have different requirements. More prestigious programs or schools will have more competition, and these programs will often require more of candidates before accepting them into the school.\n\nThe following list is taken from the University of Washington Bothell'sMBA program admissionrequirements:\n\nSome programs may require submission of a GMAT/GRE score. Other programs, like UW-Bothell, may waive the requirement if certain criteria are met.\n\nAs programs offer different services and benefits, the cost of an MBA will vary widely between program or school. Top-tier MBA programs will often be more expensive than local, smaller options.\n\nFor the 2023-2024 academic year, the first-year budget for the Wharton MBA program was $124,476. This includes $87,370 for tuition, $26,028 for room and board, $6,868 for books and supplies, and $4,210 forhealth insurance. Wharton offers many Fellowship Programs to alleviate the financial burden of the program.\n\nOther two-year, full-time programs may have similar expenses; the two-year program at the University of Chicago costs $161,922 in tuition alone for the class of 2025.\n\nShorter-term or online programs may be substantially cheaper. For example, an online MBA at the Eller College of Management through the University of Arizona has a tuition cost $56,250 as of February 2024. The program is promoted as completable in as little as 14 months.\n\nThose with an MBA often have greater skills, capabilities, and professional competency that can lead to a more successful career. Though an MBA involves a material expense, this cost often can be recovered over time through high-paying employment.\n\nAccording to Glassdoor, as of October 2023, those with an MBA received an average annualcompensation packageof over $119,000. Salary historically has been skewed towards degree holders with experience. Individuals with one year or less of experience earned over $77,000 per year, while individuals with greater than 15 years of experience earned more than $139,000.\n\nMBA holders often make substantially more than undergraduate business majors. The Raymond A. Mason School of Business at William & Mary reports that an MBA holder's salary was as much as $20,000 a year more than that of a holder of a bachelor's degree.\n\nMBA stands for Master of Business Administration. An MBA is a degree that provides advanced and thorough training in business principles and leadership skills. MBA recipients obtain this postgraduate degree to enhance their marketability as a professional.\n\nAs of February 2024, an MBA earns an estimated total pay of over $136,174 per year in the U.S. Pay is widely contingent on the industry, company, and underlying position occupied by the degree holder. For example, the same salary data indicate that most total pay packages range between $102,000 to $191,000 per year.Of course some MBAs are paid amounts below this range and some can earn much more.\n\nAn MBA serves two primary purposes. First, business professionals who obtain an MBA undergo a rigorous education that improves their skillsets. Second, MBA degree holders can be highly desired by employers. The MBA meaning can be an advantage during job searches and often results in higher pay.\n\nObtaining an MBA takes money, time, and effort. Candidates may find it demanding to compile a resum\u00e9 impressive enough to be accepted into their goal program. MBA programs may also be expensive. MBA candidates may have to scale back or step away from work as they pursue their degree. Though an MBA carries substantial long-term value, there are several shorter-term hurdles a candidate must overcome.\n\nA Master of Business Administration degree can be a boon to individuals on business or investment management career paths. The MBA degree distinguishes those awarded it due to the aptitude, study, and training it requires. The MBA meaning can confer a special quality on holders of the degree that sets them apart from others.\n\nMBA.com. \"What Are the Different Types of MBA Programs?\"\n\nFranklin University. \"How Long Will It Actually Take To Earn Your MBA?\"\n\nUniversity of Nebraska Omaha. \"MBA Curriculum.\"\n\nWharton. \"Should You Get an MBA?\"\n\nUnited States Census Bureau. \"A Higher Degree.\"\n\nUniversity of Washington | Bothell, School of Business. \"Admissions.\"\n\nUniversity of Washington Bothell. \"School of Business: GMAT/GRE Waiver Policy.\"\n\nWharton. \"Wharton MBA Financial Aid and Tuition.\"\n\nThe University of Chicago. \"Full-Time MBA Cost.\"\n\nEller College of Management. \"Online MBA Cost and Return on Investment.\"\n\nRaymond A.
