  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn autoregressive integrated moving average, or\u00a0ARIMA, is a statistical analysis model that usestime series\u00a0datato either better understand the data set or to predict future trends.\n\nA statistical model is autoregressive if it predicts future values based on past values. For example, an ARIMA model might seek to predict a stock's future prices based on its past performance or forecast a company's earnings based on past periods.\n\nAn autoregressive integrated moving average model is a form ofregression\u00a0analysisthat gauges the strength of one dependent variable relative to other changing variables. The model's goal is\u00a0to predict future securities\u00a0or financial market moves by examining the differences between values in the series instead of through\u00a0actual values.\n\nAn ARIMA model can be understood by outlining each of its components as follows:\n\nEach component in ARIMA functions as a parameter with a standard notation. For ARIMA models, a standard notation would be ARIMA\u00a0with p, d, and q, where integer values substitute for the parameters to indicate the type of ARIMA model used. The parameters can be defined as:\n\nFor example, alinear regressionmodel includes the number and type of terms. A value of zero (0), which can be used as a parameter, would mean that particular component should not be used in the model. This way, the ARIMA model can be constructed to perform the function of an ARMA model, or\u00a0even simple AR, I, or MA models.\n\nBecause ARIMA models are complicated and work best on very large data sets, computer algorithms and machine learning techniques are used to compute them.\n\nIn an autoregressive integrated moving average model,\u00a0the data are\u00a0differenced\u00a0in order to make it stationary. A model that shows stationarity is one that shows there is constancy to the data over time. Most economic and market data show trends, so\u00a0the purpose of differencing is\u00a0to remove any trends or seasonal structures.\n\nSeasonality, or when data show regular and predictable patterns that repeat over a calendar year, could negatively affect the regression model. If a trend appears\u00a0and stationarity is not evident, many of the computations throughout the process cannot be made and produce the intended results.\n\nA one-time shock will affect subsequent values of an ARIMA model infinitely into the future. Therefore, the legacy of the financial crisis lives on in today\u2019s autoregressive models.\n\nTo begin building an ARIMA model for an investment, you download as much of the price data as you can. Once you've identified the trends for the data, you identify the lowest order of differencing (d) by observing the autocorrelations. If the lag-1 autocorrelation is zero or negative, the series is already differenced. You may need to difference the series more if the lag-1 is higher than zero.\n\nNext, determine the order of regression (p) and order of moving average (q) by comparing autocorrelations and partial autocorrelations. Once you have the information you need, you can choose the model you'll use.\n\nARIMA models have strong points and are good at forecasting based on past circumstances, but there are more reasons to be cautious when using ARIMA. In stark contrast to investing disclaimers that state \"past performance is not an indicator of future performance...,\" ARIMA models assume that past values have some residual effect on current or future values and use data from the past to forecast future events.\n\nThe following table lists other ARIMA traits that demonstrate good and bad characteristics.\n\nGood for short-term forecasting\n\nNot built for long-term forecasting\n\nPoor at predicting turning points\n\nARIMA is a method for forecasting or predicting future outcomes based on a historical time series. It is based on the statistical concept of serial correlation, where past data points influence future data points.\n\nARIMA combines autoregressive features with those of moving averages. An AR(1) autoregressive process, for instance, is one in which the current value is based on the immediately preceding value, while an AR(2) process is one in which the current value is based on the previous two values. A moving average is a calculation used to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set to smooth out the influence of outliers. As a result of this combination of techniques, ARIMA models can take into account trends, cycles, seasonality, and other non-static types of data when making forecasts.\n\nARIMA forecasting is achieved by plugging in time series data for the variable of interest. Statistical software will identify the appropriate number of lags or amount of differencing to be applied to the data and check for stationarity. It will then output the results, which are often interpreted similarly to that of a multiple linear regression model.\n\nThe ARIMA model is used as a forecasting tool to predict how something will act in the future based on past performance. It is used in technical analysis to predict an asset's future performance.\n\nARIMA modeling is generally inadequate for long-term forecastings, such as more than six months ahead, because it uses past data and parameters that are influenced by human thinking. For this reason, it is best used with other technical analysis tools to get a clearer picture of an asset's performance.\n\nRobert Nau, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business. \"Introduction to ARIMA: Nonseasonal Models.\"\n\nPennsylvania State University, Eberly College of Science. \"STAT 501 Regression Methods: 5.3 - The Multiple Linear Regression Model.\"\n\nPennsylvania State University, Eberly College of Science. \"STAT 510 Applied Time Series Analysis: 3.1 Non-seasonal ARIMA Models.\"\n\nRobert Nau, Duke University, Fuqua School of Business. \"Identifying the Order of Differencing in an ARIMA Model.\"",
