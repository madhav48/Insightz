  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nInvestopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nThe direct method is one of two accounting treatments used to generate acash flow statement. The statement of cash flows direct method uses actual cash inflows and outflows from the company's operations, instead of modifying the operating section fromaccrual accountingto a cash basis. Accrual accounting recognizes revenue when it is earned versus when the payment is received from a customer.\n\nConversely, the cash flow direct method measures only the cash that's been received, which is typically from customers, and the cash payments or outflows, such as to suppliers. The inflows and outflows are netted to arrive at the cash flow. The direct method is also known as the income statement method.\n\nThe three main financial statements are the balance sheet, income statement, andcash flow statement. The cash flow statement is divided into three categories: cash flow from operating activities, cash flow from financing activities, and cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe cash flow statement can be prepared using either the direct or indirect method. The cash flow from the financing and investing activities sections will be identical under both the indirect and direct methods.\n\nThe indirect method for calculating cash flow from operations uses accrual accounting information, and it always begins with thenet incomefrom the income statement. The net income is then adjusted for changes in the asset and liability accounts on thebalance sheetby adding to or subtracting from net income to derive the cash flow from operations.\n\nUnder the direct method, the only section of the statement of cash flows that will differ in the presentation is the cash flow from the operations section. The direct method lists the cash receipts and cash payments made during the accounting period.\n\nThe cash outflows are subtracted from the cash inflows to calculate the net cash flow from operating activities before the net cash from investing and financing activities are included to get the net cash increase or decrease in the company for that period of time.\n\nThe cash flow statement's direct method takes the actual cash inflows and outflows to determine the changes in cash over the period.\n\nThe difficulty and time required to list all the cash disbursements and receipts\u2014required for the direct method\u2014makes the indirect method a preferred and more commonly used practice. Since most companies use the accrual method of accounting, business activities are recorded on the balance sheet and income statement consistent with this method.\n\nFor example, a company using accrual accounting will reportsalesrevenue on the income statement in the current period even if the sale was made on credit and cash has not yet been received from the customer.\n\nThis same amount would also appear on the balance sheet in accounts receivable. Companies that use accrual accounting do not also collect and store transactional information per customer or supplier on a cash basis.\n\nAnother complexity of the direct method is that the FASB requires a business using the direct method to disclose the reconciliation of net income to the cash flow from operating activities that would have been reported if the indirect method had been used to prepare the statement.\n\nThereconciliationreport is used to check the accuracy of the operating activities, and it is similar to the indirect report. The reconciliation report begins by listing the net income and adjusting it for non-cash transactions and changes in the balance sheet accounts. This added task makes the direct method unpopular among companies.\n\nExamples of the direct method for the statement of cash flows included in the operations section include the following:\n\nA straightforward presentation of cash flow from operations using the direct method looks somewhat like this:\n\nListing out information this way provides the financial statement user with a more detailed view of where a company\u2019s cash came from and how it was disbursed. For this reason, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) recommends companies use the direct method.\n\nAlthough it has its disadvantages, the statement of cash flows direct method reports the direct sources of cash receipts and payments, which can be helpful to investors and creditors.\n\nThe direct method of accounting for cash flows uses real cash inflows and outflows from a business's operations. This process records cash as it comes in or is paid out. Conversely, the accrual accounting method records revenues and expenses as they occur, rather than when money comes in or out.\n\nYes, the direct method of accounting for cash flow is allowed under the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The indirect method is also allowed; however, the guidelines tend to promote the direct method.\n\nThe three methods of accounting are (1) the cash-basis accounting method, (2) the accrual accounting method, and (3) the modified cash-basis accounting method. The cash-basis accounting method records transactions as money comes in and out. The accrual accounting method records transactions as they are incurred, whether or not money has come in or gone out. The modified cash-basis method is a blend of the two.\n\nWhile the direct method of cash flow accounting is more time-consuming, it provides more detail about the operating cash flow account, which helps analysts and business managers get a more holistic understanding of the cash cycle and profitability.\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board. \"Summary of Statement No. 95.\"",
