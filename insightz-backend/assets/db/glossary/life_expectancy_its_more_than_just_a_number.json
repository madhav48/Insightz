  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nLife expectancy is a statistical estimate of the average number of years a person is expected to live , based on actuarial data. There are many uses for life expectancy in the financial industry, including for life insurance, pension planning, and U.S. Social Security benefits. In most countries, the calculations for actuarial ages are derived\u00a0from a national statistical agency based on large amounts of data.\n\nLife expectancy is the single most influential factor that insurance companies use to determine lifeinsurance premiums.Using actuarial tables provided by sources such as the Internal Revenue Service, these companies use actuarial age as they try to minimize their\u00a0liability risk.\n\nThere are several factors that affect your life expectancy (also known as youractuarial age). The two single most important considerations are when you were born and your gender. Additional factors that can influence your life expectancy include:\n\nYou can view the federal government's data on U.S. life expectancy on theNational Center for Health Statistics websiteand in theSocial Security Administration's Actuarial Period Life Table.\n\nIt's important to note that life expectancy changes over time. That's because as you age, actuaries use complex formulas that factor out people who are younger than you but have already died. As you continue to age past mid-life, you outlive an increasing number of people who are younger than you, so your life expectancy actually increases. In other words, the older you get (past a certain age), the older you are likely to get.\n\nOverall, human life expectancy has been rapidly increasing during the past two hundred years, particularly in developing countries. However, that rate did decline in the early 2020s during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, the average life expectancy in the United States was 76.1 years.\n\nLife expectancy is the primary risk factor in determining whether someone buying life insurance will pass away, so theirbeneficiarieswill make a death benefit claim. Insurance companies consider age, lifestyle choices, personal and family medical history, and several other factors when determining premium rates for individual life insurance policies.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between your life expectancy and how much you'll be charged for alife insurancepolicy. The younger you are when you purchase a life insurance policy, the longer you are likely to live. That means there is a lower risk to thelife insurance companybecause you are less likely to die in thenear term, which would require a payout of the full benefit of your policy before you have paid much into the policy.\n\nConversely, the longer you wait to purchase life insurance, the lower your life expectancy, which translates into a higher risk for the life insurance company. Companies compensate for that risk by charging a higher premium.\n\nThe principle of life expectancy suggests that you should purchase a life insurance policy for yourself and your spouse sooner rather than later. You will save on premium costs. If you buy apermanent policythat builds cash value, buying while younger also gives your policy more time to build savings.\n\nLife expectancy is critical forretirement planning. Many aging workers arrange their retirement plans' asset allocations based on a prediction of how long they expect\u00a0to live. Personal, rather than statistical, life expectancy is a primary factor in creating a retirement plan.\n\nWhen couples are planning for retirement, they often use ajoint lifeexpectancy. This approach takes the life expectancy of their partner (who may become the beneficiary of a retirement fund or pension plan) into account as well as their own. The IRS provides tables to help you calculate joint life expectancy.\n\nMost retirement plans, including traditional, Roth, SEP, and SIMPLEIRA plans, also use life expectancy to determine the implementation ofrequired minimum distributions(RMDs) for the plan.\u00a0Most retirement plans expect participants to begin taking at least the RMD by the time they reach the age of 72 (or age 73, starting in 2023).Retirement plans base distributions on IRS life expectancy tables. Some qualified plans may allow RMD distributions to begin at a later date.\n\nDue to an increase in life expectancy, Congress adjusted the required minimum distribution age from 70\u00bd to 72 in 2019, andagain to age 73starting in 2023.\n\nYour life expectancy is also a significant factor when arrangingannuitypayments with an insurance company. In an annuity contract, the insurance company agrees to pay a certain amount of money for a fixed period or until the policyholder's\u00a0death.\n\nIt's important to take life expectancy into account when negotiating annuity contracts. If you agree to receive payouts for a specific period, you are essentially estimating how long you expect to live. If you outlive this period, you stop receiving money from the annuity. You may also elect to use a single-life annuity payment plan\u00a0in which annuity payments will continue as long as you're alive. If you're married, you could use a joint-life annuity that lasts as long as you or your spouse is alive.\n\nThe average lifespan at birth for a woman in the United States is 79.1 years as of 2021, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The average lifespan for men at birth was 73.2 years. This representsa decline from prior years, largely due to drug overdoses, accidents, and the COVID-19 pandemic. The overall life expectancy is 76.1 years.\n\nLife insurance companies use mortality tables to estimate the life expectancy of their policyholders, based on the statistical averages for people with similar ages and health. This allows them to predict how much money they will have to pay out in claims.\n\nWhen you retire, the IRS uses actuarial tables to estimate your remaining lifespan during retirement. This number is used to calculate your required minimum distributions\u2014the mandatory withdrawals from certain tax-advantaged retirement accounts that you must take starting at age 73. If you do not withdraw the full RMD by the due date, the amount you did not take out is subject to a 50% excise tax.\n\nYour age is the primary factor companies consider when deciding how much to charge for life insurance (followed by your health condition). Life expectancy is greater at younger ages, so the younger you are when you apply for coverage, the lower your rates.\n\nLife expectancy indicates how much longer the average person of your age will live. Your estimated life expectancy plays an important role in a number of financial decisions, from how much money you should save for retirement to when you should buy insurance and how much you will pay for your coverage. Keep life expectancy in mind as you make these major financial decisions.\n\nNew York State. \"The Cost of Life Insurance.\"\n\nCenters for Disease Control. \"Life Expectancy in the US Dropped for the Second Year in a Row in 2021.\"\n\nProtective.\"The Cost of Waiting.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service.\"Publication 590-B (2022), Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs).\"Appendix B.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"H.R.2617 - Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics-Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service.\"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nTexas Department of Insurance. \"Life Insurance Guide.\"",
