  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nActuarial science is a\u00a0discipline that assessesfinancial risksin the insurance and finance fields, using mathematical and statistical methods. Actuarial science applies\u00a0the mathematics of probability and statistics to define, analyze, and solve the financial implications of uncertain future events. Traditional actuarial science largely revolves around the analysis of mortality and the production of life tables, and the application ofcompound interest.\n\nActuarial science attempts toquantify the risk of an event occurringusing probability analysis so that its financial impact can be determined. Actuarial science is typically used in the insurance industry by actuaries.Actuariesanalyze mathematical models to predict or forecast the reasonableness of an event occurring so that an insurance company can allocate funds to pay out any claims that might result from the event.For example, studying the mortality rates of individuals of a certain age would help insurance companies understand the likelihood or timeframe of paying out alife insurancepolicy.\n\nActuarial science became a formal mathematical discipline in the late 17th century with the increased demand for long-term insurance coverage.\u00a0Actuarial science spans\u00a0several\u00a0interrelated subjects, including\u00a0mathematics,\u00a0probability theory,statistics,\u00a0finance,economics, and\u00a0computer science.Historically, actuarial science used deterministic models in the construction of tables and premiums. In the last 30 years, science has undergone revolutionary changes\u00a0due to the proliferation of high-speed computers and the union of\u00a0stochastic\u00a0actuarial models with modern financial theory.\n\nLife insurance and pension plans are the two main applications of actuarial science. However, actuarial science is also applied in the study of financial organizations to analyze theirliabilitiesand improve financial decision-making. Actuaries employ this specialty science to evaluate the financial, economic, and other business applications of future events.\n\nIn traditional life insurance, actuarial science focuses on the analysis of\u00a0mortality, the production of\u00a0life tables, and the application ofcompound interest, which is the accumulated interest from previous periods\u00a0plus the interest on the principal investment. As a result, actuarial science can help develop policies for financial products such asannuities, which are investments that pay a fixed income stream. Actuarial science is also used to determine the various financial outcomes for investable assets held by non-profit corporations as a result ofendowments.\n\nIn health insurance, including employer-provided plans\u00a0and social insurance, actuarial science includes analyzing\u00a0rates of\n\nFor example, disability rates are determined for veterans that may have been wounded in the line of duty. Certain percentages are assigned to the extent of the disability to determine the payout from disability insurance.\n\nActuarial science is also applied to property, casualty, liability, and general insurance\u2013instances in which\u00a0coverage is generally provided on a renewable period, (such as yearly). Coverage can be canceled at the end of the period by either party.\n\nIn the pension industry, actuarial science compares the\u00a0costs of alternative strategies with regard to the design, funding, accounting, administration, and maintenance or redesign ofpension plans.\u00a0A pension plan is adefined-benefit plan, which is a type of retirement plan involving contributions from the employer to be set aside and paid out to the employees upon retirement.\n\nShort-term and long-term bond rates greatly influence pension plans and their investment strategies.Bondsare debt instruments issued by governments and corporations that typically pay a periodic interest rate. For example, in a low-interest-rate environment, a pension plan might have difficulty earning income from the bonds that it has invested in, which increases the probability that the pension plan could run out of money.\n\nOther factors impacting a pension plan's viability include benefit arrangements,\u00a0collective bargaining,\u00a0the employer's\u00a0competitors,\u00a0and changing demographics of the workforce. Tax laws and the policies of theInternal Revenue Service (IRS)regarding the calculation of pension surpluses also impact the finances of a pension plan. Additionally, economic conditions and\u00a0trends in the financial markets can impact the probability of a pension plan remaining funded.\n\nActuaries may also work in the public sector to assist with proposed changes to Social Security, Medicare, or other programs.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of actuaries employed is expected to grow 23% from 2022 to 2032.For this reason, many universities offer educational degrees and courses on actuarial science. In addition, there are professional designations for those interested in pursuing the field.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries identifies and reports colleges that meet one of three levels of recognition:\n\nAs of December 2022, there are roughly 25 Center of Actuarial Excellence schools across the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore, the United Kingdom, and China. Within the U.S., these schools include but are not limited to Brigham Young, Georgia State, Purdue, Connecticut, and Michigan.\n\nAccording to the latest BLS wage data, the median annual wage for actuaries in 2021 was $113,990.\n\nThere are a number of different professional designations an actuary can pursue to further gain credibility and proficiency in their field. The Casualty Actuarial Society offers theAssociate (ACAS)andFellow (FCAS)membership levels, each of the two with escalating requirements. For example, the ACAS credential can be achieved after passing six exams, while the FCAS is earned after nine exams. Areas of focus for the FCAS exam include:\n\nThe Society of Actuaries promotes several different actuarial exams to demonstrate competency in the field.\n\nActuarial science is a difficult profession. Actuarial exams usually last between 3 and 5 hours, and each requires rigorous preparation. Candidates must often have a bachelor's degree, and it make take up to a decade for a candidate to complete all training and exams.\n\nActuaries often have a background in probability, statistics, and financial mathematics. Most often, an actuary will assess the probability of an event happening, then apply statistical methods to determine what the financial impact of that outcome will be.Actuaries usually do not use calculus at work, though calculus may be a prerequisite to meeting other course requirements.\n\nFor most, it may take up to a decade or longer to become an actuary. A bachelor's degree in actuarial science may take between 3 to 5 years, and it may take at least another several years to pass rigorous professional actuarial exams.\n\nActuarial science is the study of mathematically predicting the probability of something happening in the future and assigning that outcome a financial value. Companies, pension funds, and insurance agencies rely on actuaries to develop models to assess areas of risk and devise policies to mitigate potential future challenges.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Actuaries.\"\n\nFlorida Agricultural and Mechanical University. \"About Actuarial Science.\"\n\nYork University. \"Actuarial Science.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Actuaries.\"\n\nSociety of Actuaries. \"Universities & Colleges with Actuarial Programs.\"\n\nCasualty Actuarial Society. \"Credential Requirements.\"\n\nSociety of Actuaries. \"Exams & Requirements.\"",
