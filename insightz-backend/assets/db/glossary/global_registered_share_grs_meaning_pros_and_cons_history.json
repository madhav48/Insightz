  "term": "Global Registered Share (GRS): Meaning, Pros and Cons, History",
  "definition": "A global registered share (GRS), or a global share, is a security that is issued in the United States,\u00a0but it is registered in multiple markets around the world\u00a0and trades in multiple currencies. With global shares, identical shares may trade on different stock exchanges and in various currencies across country borders without needing to be converted into\u00a0local currencies.\n\nAll holders of global shares, as with any othershareholder, have equal rights\u2014such as voting,\u00a0percentage of dividends, and so forth\u2014in theissuingcorporation.\n\nGlobal shares are similar toordinary sharesexcept that investors can trade them on\u00a0stock exchanges around the world in different currencies. For example, if a publicly traded company issues shares in dollars on theNew York Stock Exchange(NYSE) and issues the same security in pounds on the London Stock Exchange (or vice versa), then it is issuing global shares.\n\nGlobal shares are different from the more popularinternational depositary receipts(IDRs).\u00a0IDRs are negotiable certificates issued by a bank that represent ownership of stock in a foreign company held by the bank intrust.\n\nIn the U.S., IDRs are known asAmerican depositary receipts(ADRs).\u00a0The main difference between\u00a0ADRs and global shares is that ADRs are issued only by U.S. banks for foreign stocks that are traded on a U.S. exchange. The underlying security of an ADR is held by an overseas branch of an American financial institution, rather than by a global institution.\n\nADRs have become known as an efficient way to buy shares in a foreign company and obtain dividends and capital gains in U.S. dollars.\u00a0J.P. Morgan created and launched the first ADR for London\u2019s famed department store\u00a0Selfridges. (The founder of Selfridges, Harry Gordon Selfridge, was American.) This first-ever ADR was listed on the New York Curb Exchange\u2014a precursor to theAmerican Stock Exchange(AMEX)\u2014on April 29, 1927.\n\nIn Europe, IDRs are known asglobal depositary receipts(GDRs).\u00a0GDRs are bank certificates that are issued in multiple countries for shares in a foreign company. The shares of a GDR trade as domestic securities that represent a foreign (non-U.S.) interest.\u00a0GDRs may be used by private markets to raise capital that is denominated in either American dollars oreuros.\n\nA global share\u00a0allows for cross-market portability, while generally costing less than\u00a0other instruments of its type. Because of increasing globalization, securities might trade in multiple markets going forward, which could make the concept of ADRs less valid, but would make global shares more attractive.\n\nAs trading moves toward an around-the-clock timetable, various stock markets andclearinghousescould consolidate, which would make global shares more convenient. Moreover, the regulatory structures of different markets could become more aligned, which would make it less necessary for securities to comply with different local regulations. Finally, a globalfungiblesecurity is likely\u00a0best suited to track liquidity around the world.\n\nEven with their potential benefits, very few global shares have been launched since they appeared on the finance scene. Most companies that list securities in the U.S. want access to the broadest range of U.S. investors possible. Some securities experts believe that moving from an ADR to a global share would do just the opposite\u2014reduceliquidityinstead of enhance it.\n\nAnother potential problem is whether the global trading system would be able to handle widespread trading of global shares because trading is still influenced by regulatory bodies that are national, not international. Before a global share can be launched, operators of the home country's clearinghouses must work closely with a U.S. counterpart in order to harmonize their listing requirements with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nNew structures would need to be built one country at a time. Some critics believe that the cost of creating global shares\u00a0programs would be too great, thus offsetting any benefits; and that too much would need to change too fast in order for global shares to work effectively in the near term.\n\nYet\u00a0proponents of global shares say that it is only a matter of time before more businesses replace their ADRs with a single global security, mainly because of how cheap they are to trade.\n\nThere is always comfort in the familiar. ADRs have enjoyed a long, lucrative history, and they continue to be U.S.-based investors'\u00a0tool of choice\u00a0for listing\u00a0foreign stock in America. Although no one knows what may come of GRSs as a trading tool\u00a0going forward, the\u00a0comfortable tradition of\u00a0ADRs, combined with the problems of balancing local market regulations with U.S. rules, could well deter finance managers from issuing quantities of global shares any time soon.\n\nForeign issuers have been keen to list securities on the NYSE from the exchanges earliest days, as well as registering them with the\u00a0SEC). Listing stock in the U.S.\u00a0makes sense for foreign companies because it offers enhanced scope andliquidityby increasing the number of potential purchasers of the shares being offered. For foreign companies that already\u00a0have a large number of shareholders, substantial assets, or operations\u00a0in the U.S., the need for a U.S. listing is even more pressing.\n\nHowever, listing securities in the U.S. has never been stress-free for non-U.S. companies. To start, foreign companies incur huge initial\u2014and extensive ongoing\u2014costs\u00a0when listing in the U.S. Then, they need to restate their financials\u00a0in accordance with U.S.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles(GAAP); or\u00a0be prepared to discuss and quantify the material differences between the accounting principles of their home country and U.S. GAAP.\u00a0Moreover, these\u00a0issuers\u00a0become subject to continual reporting requirements. They also are faced with certain rules about how they may conduct their business, including limitations in\u00a0dealing\u00a0with the press\u2014even in their home countries.\n\nJ.P.
