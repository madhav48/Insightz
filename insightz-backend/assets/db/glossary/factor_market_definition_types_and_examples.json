  "definition": "The term \"factor market\" refers to the inputs used in economic activity and production to generate income.\n\n\"Factor market\" is a term that economists use for all the resources businesses use to purchase, rent, or hire what they need to produce goods or services. These needs are the factors of production and include raw materials, land, labor, and capital.\n\nThe factor market is also referred to as the input market. All markets are either factor markets where businesses obtain the resources they need, or goods and services markets where consumers make their purchases.\n\nA factor market is also referred to as an input market. The market for finished products or services is called the output market. This can be viewed as a closed-loop flow. Households are sellers and businesses are buyers in the factor market. Businesses are sellers and households are buyers in the goods and services market.\n\nWorkers participate in the factor market when they make their services available to businesses. An individual member of a household who's looking for a job is participating in the factor market. An employee's wages are a component of the factor market but the money will be spent in the goods and services market.\n\nThe factor market provides every component required to produce goods and services.\n\nWorkers in the appliance manufacturing industry who are skilled in refrigerator and dishwasher assembly are considered part of the factor market when they're available for hire. Job search websites are part of the factor market.\n\nRaw materials like steel and plastic, both of which are used to build refrigerators and dishwashers, are also examples of factor market products. They're part of the output market when the refrigerators and dishwashers are sold.\n\nMost people participate in the factor markets in at least two ways. You're effectively part of the labor market if you work for wages or a salary. You're also participating in thecapital marketif you save or invest your income.\n\nThe combination of factor markets and the\u00a0goods and services market forms a closed loop for the flow of money. Households supplylaborto companies which pay them wages that are then used to buy goods and services from companies.\n\nThe goods and services market drives the factor market. Manufacturers increase their purchases of the resources used to make those goods and services when consumers demand more goods and services. Factor market producers then step up production of the raw materials that the manufacturers need.\n\nThe factor market is one of the defining characteristics of amarket economy. Traditional models of\u00a0socialism\u00a0are characterized by the replacement of factor markets which respond to the dictates of supply and demand, with central economic planning which dictates supply and assigns resources accordingly.\n\nSocialism assumes that market exchanges are redundant within the production process if capital goods are\u00a0owned by a single entity\u00a0representing the interests of the society as a whole.\n\nA market economy has three components: the factor market at one end, the consumer market at the other end, and the producers in between. These are the companies that create the products we use.\n\nA monopoly exists when there's only a single producer or seller of a product or service to serve many buyers. A monopsony is the opposite: There are many producers but only one buyer. Both are considered examples ofmarket failures. The law of supply and demand can't work efficiently in either situation because of a lack of competition.\n\nThis has particular relevance to the labor component of the factor market. An employee has no bargaining power in a town where there's only one possible employer. A consumer faced with just one brand has no choice but to pay the price demanded for that brand and accept the quality offered.\n\nA monopoly has an equally destructive effect in the factor market. A single supplier is under no pressure to cut prices, innovate, or even excel.\n\nMonopoly and monopsony are seen as disturbing the equilibrium of a factor market that depends on competition to work efficiently.\n\nA market economy can't exist without three interdependent components: the factor market at one end, the goods and services market at the other end, and the producers, the companies that create the products we use, in between.\n\nThe producers obtain what they need in the factor market, produce finished products, and sell them to end-users. The end-users create and sustain demand for raw materials that are then made available by the factor market to supply the producers. This is known as derived demand.\n\nThe factor market responds to demand and the cycle continues.\n\nThe factor market is driven by demand in the product market. The resources needed to produce goods and services are created or obtained in sufficient quantities to satisfy demand in the product market. The consumer market effectively dictates the factor market.\n\nBusinesses are the buyers in the factor market. They may buy, rent, or hire raw materials, land, or labor. Whatever a business needs to build, package, and deliver the products or services they provide must be obtained in the factor market.\n\nThe sellers include producers of raw materials. Every individual who has a job is a participant in the factor market, however. The skills and labor the person is offering in return for compensation is a product that's made available in the factor market.\n\nEconomists generally divide the factor market into three components:\n\nThese are the factors of production.\n\nThe factor market refers to the costs of all the different inputs that are used in economic activity such as raw materials, machinery, investments, and labor. Whenever an individual earns a salary or saves that money in the bank, they are effectively participating in the factor markets.\n\nHigher Rock Education. \"Factor Market.\"\n\nYour Article Library. \"How to Determine the Factor Prices under Monopsony Market.\"\n\nEconomics Help. \"Derived Demand.\"",
