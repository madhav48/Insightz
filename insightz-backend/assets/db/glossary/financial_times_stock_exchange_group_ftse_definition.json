  "definition": "The FTSE (pronounced \"footsie\") is an acronym for the FTSE Russell Group, formerly the Financial Times Stock Exchange Group. \"The FTSE\" is also a short-hand reference to the FTSE 100, the main index that tracks prices on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nTheLondon Stock Exchange Group(LSEG) owns the FTSE Russell Group, which creates and manages various indexes that track global stocks, including the FTSE 100.\n\nThe indexing division of the FTSE is comparable to that ofStandard & Poor\u2019sin the U.S. It creates and publishes indexes that the global financial markets can use asbenchmarks. (An index is a hypothetical portfolio of stock holdings that serves as a representation, or benchmark, of the performance of a particular market segment.)\n\nThe FTSE offers many indexes but its best known are the FTSE 100, which\u00a0is comprised of the most highly capitalizedblue-chip stockslisted on the London Stock Exchange, and the Russell 2000 Index, a small-cap stock market index of the smallest 2,000 stocks in the Russell 3000 Index.\n\nThe FTSE Russell Group, established in 2015 after the merger of FTSE and Russell Investments, is a U.K.-based global provider of benchmark financial indexes, market data, and analytics.\n\nThe FTSE has many other indexes that serve as benchmarks for various asset classes and investing strategies.\n\nThe FTSE 100 is widely used\u00a0in Europe. At its creation, in January 1984, the index had a base level of 1,000. It has since reached highs of over 7,000.\n\nMany market analysts, traders, and investors look to the FTSE 100 as a proxy for the performance of the wider U.K. stock market, similar to the way U.S. investors watch the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes.\n\nThe level of the\u00a0FTSE\u00a0100 is calculated using the total market capitalization of the constituent companies and the index value. Total market capitalization changes alongside individual share prices of the indexed companies throughout the trading day. When the FTSE 100 is quoted up or down, it is measured against the previous day\u2019s market\u00a0close.\n\nIt is calculated continuously on every trading day\u2014from 8:00 a.m. at the market opening until the 4:30 p.m. LSE close. A FTSE 100 decline\u00a0means the value of the largest U.K.-listedcompanies has decreased. When the FTSE hits a new high, it means the total worth of all the indexed companies has increased.\n\nReadjustment of the indexconstituents, the companies that make up the FTSE 100, is undertaken every quarter, usually on the Wednesday following the first Friday in\u00a0March, June, September, and December. Any changes to the underlying index constituents and their weighting come from the values of the companies taken at the close of business the night before the review.\n\nAs of June 22, 2024, the top five FTSE 100 holdings by market cap were:\n\nThe FTSE 100 is often considered a leading indicator of prosperity for companies in the U.K. and the U.K. economy in general. As such, it typically draws investors looking for exposure to big U.K. companies.\n\nWhile several of its listings are companies with homes outside of the U.K., it is mostly made up of U.K. companies and impacted by U.K. daily developments.\n\nA large prolific number of indexes are attached to the FTSE Group and the FTSE Russell brand. The\u00a0FTSE Group's most popular\u00a0indexes\u2014in addition to\u00a0the FTSE 100\u2014are the\u00a0FTSE 250, the FTSE 350, and the FTSE All-Share.\n\nSome of the other popular FTSE Russell indices include:\n\nThough you cannot directly invest in an index, you can invest in funds that replicate, track, or evenshort the FTSE index.\n\nMany of these are exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Examples of funds that track these indices are the Vanguard FTSE 100, the Vanguard FTSE 250, the iShares 350 U.K. Equity Index Fund, the iShares Core FTSE 100, and the Vanguard FTSE U.K. All Share Index Unit Trust.\n\nThe most-quoted FTSE index is the FTSE 100, which tracks the top 100 companies by market cap in the U.K. If the financial media report that London stocks are up or down, they're talking about the movements of the FTSE 100.\n\nThe U.S. version of this would be the S&P 500, which tracks the top 500 U.S. companies by market cap, or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which tracks 30 prominent U.S. companies.\n\nThe easiest way for Americans to invest in the FTSE is by investing inexchange-traded funds that track its indices, such as the Vanguard FTSE 100, the Vanguard FTSE 250, the iShares 350 U.K. Equity Index Fund, and the iShares Core FTSE 100.\n\nA stock exchange is a company that operates a marketplace where stocks are bought and sold. The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq are examples.\n\n\"Stock market\" is an umbrella term that refers to all of the stocks that trade in a country or region.\n\nThe Financial Times Stock Exchange, now known as the FTSE Russell Group, provides a variety of indices that track different segments of the U.K. financial markets. Its most popular index, the FTSE 100, tracks the top 100 companies by market cap in the United Kingdom, similarly to how the S&P 500 works in the U.S.\n\nInvestors outside the U.K. can gain exposure to these indices by investing in mutual funds or ETFs that track the indices.\n\nFTSE Russell. \"FTSE U.K. Index Series,\" Page 5.\n\nLondon Stock Exchange. \"FTSE 100: Constituents.\"",
