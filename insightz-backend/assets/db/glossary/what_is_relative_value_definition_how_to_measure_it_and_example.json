  "definition": "Relative value is a method of determining an asset's worth that takes into account the value of similar assets. This is in contrast withabsolute value, which looks only at an asset'sintrinsic valueand does not compare it to other assets. Theprice-to-earnings ratio(P/E ratio) is a popular valuation method that can be used to measure the relative value of stocks.\n\nValue investors examine thefinancial statementsof competing companies before deciding where to invest their money. They look at relevant footnotes, management commentary, and economic data to assess the stock's value relative to its peers.\n\nSteps in relative valuation may include:\n\nInvestors must always choose among the investments that are actually available at any given time, and relative valuation helps them to do that. By 2019, it was easy to look back at the prices of most U.S. stocks in 2009 and realize that they were undervalued. However, that does not help one to choose better investments today. That is where a relative valuation method like thestock market capitalization-to-GDP ratioshines. TheWorld Bankmaintains data on stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP for many nations covering several decades.\ufeff\ufeff With U.S. stocks near record highs in terms of stock market capitalization as a percentage of GDP in 2019, stocks in most other countries were relatively inexpensive.\n\nInvestors must always choose among the investments that are actually available at any given time, and relative valuation helps them to do that.\n\nThe primary flaw of relative valuation is that it may condemn investors to making the best of a bad situation. When limited to a singleasset class, relative valuation can do little more than reduce losses in extreme circumstances. For example,value fundsgenerally did much better than the S&P 500 during the 2000-2002bear market. Unfortunately, most of them still lost money.\n\nRelative valuation is one of two important methods of placing a monetary value on a company; the other is intrinsic valuation. Investors might be familiar with theDiscounted Cash Flows(DCF) method for determining the intrinsic value of a company. While relative valuation incorporates many multiples, a DCF model uses a company\u2019s future free cash flow projections and discounts them. That is achieved by using a required annual rate. Eventually, an analyst will arrive at a present value estimate, which can then be used to evaluate the potential for investment. If the DCF value is higher than the cost of the investment, the opportunity may be a good one.\n\nConsider the following table of financial information comparing Microsoft to other technology firms.\n\nMarket Capitalization (millions)\n\nBased on the above relative value analysis results, Microsoft is overvalued relative to Oracle. However, Microsoft is also undervalued relative to VMware.\n\nThe World Bank. \"Market Capitalization of Listed Domestic Companies (% of GDP).\" Accessed Jan. 30, 2021.",
