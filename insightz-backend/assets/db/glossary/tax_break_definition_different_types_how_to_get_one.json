  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe term \u201ctax break\u201d refers to a benefit offered by the government that reduces yourtotal tax liability. Tax breaks are made possible bytax lawsand typically come in the form of credits and deductions. Other tax breaks include exemptions and excluding certain types ofincomefrom your state or federaltax return.\n\nTax breaks also refer to the favorable tax treatment that certain groups receive. Churches and religious organizations, for example, are generally exempt from federal, state, and local income and property taxes, among other tax perks.Likewise, people affected bynatural disastersreceive tax breaks in the form of filing and payment extensions, penalty and interest waivers, and deductions for casualty and theft losses.\n\nThe government provides tax breaks to individual and corporatetaxpayers, greatly reducing theirtax liabilities. Tax credits, deductions, exemptions, and tax exclusions may enable these savings.\n\nIn some cases, you don\u2019t have to take any action to get a tax break. For example,life insurance proceedsyou receive are generally excluded from your taxable income\u2014and you don\u2019t have to report them.However, to take advantage of most tax breaks, you must claim them (e.g., tax credits or deductions) on your income tax return and meet specific eligibility requirements.\n\nThe personal exemption was a federal tax break up until 2017. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, thepersonal exemptiondeduction is suspended (reduced to $0) for tax years 2018 through 2025.\n\nTax breaks can stimulate theeconomyby increasing the amount taxpayers have to spend and boosting what businesses can invest in their growth. Moreover, tax breaks can promote certain behaviors that benefit society, such as replacing gas-guzzling cars with modern fuel-efficient vehicles.\n\nAs noted above, tax breaks are implemented because of state and federal tax laws. Regulations outline how tax breaks work, who qualifies, and (in some cases) how long the tax break lasts. The U.S. Congress and the president are responsible for approving federal income tax laws. For instance, Congress approved theTax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which made significant changes to the U.S. tax code and was signed into law in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nCharitable organizations and religious institutions are generally tax exempt. This means they are not required to pay federal income taxes.\n\nAtax creditreduces your tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This has a greater impact than a deduction, which merely reduces the amount of income subject to taxes. A tax credit is applied to the amount of tax you owe after all deductions are taken from your taxable income.For example, if you owe $3,000 in taxes and are eligible for a $1,100 tax credit, the amount you owe decreases to $1,900 ($3,000 - $1,100) after the tax break is applied.\n\nTax credits lower your tax bill on a dollar-for-dollar basis. On the other hand, tax deductions reduce your taxable income\u2014or the amount of income on which your taxes are calculated.Tax credits are worth more than deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill.\n\nCorporationscan also take advantage of tax credits to lower their tax bills. The government permits these to benefit workers and the national economy. Certain credits are implemented regardless of the industry or sector, such asbusiness tax credits, investment credits, and credits for child care for workers. They can also be more industry-specific, such as those in the agricultural, energy, and mining sectors.\n\nTax deductions are expensesthat can be subtracted from yourgross incometo reduce your taxable income\u2014and therefore, your tax bill.For example, a $1,000 tax deduction would lower your taxable income by that same amount. The value of the deduction depends on yourtax bracket. So, if you are in the 22% tax bracket, that $1,000 tax deduction would save you $220 ($1,000 \u00d7 22%) on your tax bill.\n\nMost taxpayers have the option to take the standard deduction (a fixed dollar amount based on your filing status) or itemize their deductions onSchedule Aof Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Here\u2019s a rundown of the standard deduction amounts for 2024 and 2025:\n\nDeductions you can itemize include:\n\nIf the sum of the deductions you can itemize exceeds your standard deduction, it makes financial sense to itemize.\n\nA tax exclusion shelters a certain portion of income or type of income from taxation. For example, you can generally exclude child support payments, life insurance proceeds, and municipal bond income from your taxable income. Likewise, health insurance premiums that your employer pays are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes, and the portion of premiums you pay is generally excluded from your taxable income.\n\nAnother common tax exclusion pertains to home sales. If you have acapital gainfrom selling your main home, you canexclude up to $250,000($500,000 if married filing jointly) of that gain from your income. To qualify, you must:\n\nAlso, if you earn income in a foreign country, you may be eligible for a tax break through theforeign earned income exclusion. The total for an individual is $126,500 for the 2024 tax year and $130,000 for the 2025 tax year.\n\nTax credits and tax deductions both save you money at tax time, but credits are more favorable. Tax credits lower the amount of tax you owe\u2014dollar for dollar\u2014while tax deductions reduce your taxable income. For instance, a $1,000 tax credit cuts $1,000 off your tax bill, and a $1,000 tax deduction lowers your taxable income by $1,000. So, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would reduce your tax bill by $220.\n\nMany tax credits may yield better favorable results compared to tax deductions, especially if those tax credits are refundable. Refundable tax credits can reduce a taxpayer\u2019s liability below $0 and result in a refund. While tax deductions can only limit the taxability of an individual\u2019s income, some tax credits actually return a refund.\n\nThe annual exclusion for gifts is $18,000 for 2024 and $19,000 in 2025.That means you can give up to $18,000 or $19,000 tax free to as many people as you wish without using any of your lifetime gift andestate tax exemption.\n\nBroadly speaking, many tax breaks favor individuals with lower income. Many tax deductions and credits phase out as an individual\u2019s income increases, meaning a person may only receive a partial amount of a tax break. Eventually, taxpayers with income \u201ctoo high\u201d will not quality for certain tax breaks.\n\nIn addition, many tax breaks are designed for specific economic activity. For example, to incentivize workers to contribute to their retirement accounts, certain contributions may receive favorable tax treatment. These types of tax breaks can be obtained by simply engaging in the qualification requirement.\n\nThe ultimate goal of many is to reduce their tax liability owed to the federal government. Individuals, corporations, and nonprofit entities all leverage tax breaks that exclude some income from being taxable, allow for parts of net income to be deductible, and permit certain credits to directly reduce taxes owed. In general, it\u2019s advisable to pursue tax breaks to limit your tax exposure.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTax Information for Churches and Religious Organizations.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCredits and Deductions for Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income,\u201d Pages 22\u201323 and 30.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTax Reform Provisions That Affect Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cPublication 5307: Tax Reform Basics for Individuals and Families.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cChurches, Integrated Auxiliaries, and Conventions or Associations of Churches.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cExemption Requirements\u2014501(c)(3) Organizations.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cBusiness Tax Credits.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRev.
