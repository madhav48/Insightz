  "definition": "A growth curve is a graphical representation how how something changes over time. An example of a growth curve might be a chart showing a country's population increase over time.\n\nGrowth curves are widely used instatisticsto determine patterns of growth over time of a quantity\u2014be it linear, exponential, or cubic.Businesses use growth curves to track or predict many factors, including futuresales.\n\nThe shape of a growth curve can make a big difference when a business determines whether to launch a new product or enter anew market. Slow growth markets are less likely to be appealing because there is less room for profit.Exponential growthis generally positive but could mean that the market will attract a lot of competitors.\n\nGrowth curves were initially used in the physical sciences such as biology.Today, they're a common component of social sciences as well.\n\nAdvancements in digital technologies and business models now require analysts to account for growth patterns unique to the modern economy. For example, the winner-take-all phenomenon is a fairly recent development brought on by companies such asAmazon, Google, and Apple. Researchers are scrambling to make sense of growth curves that are unique to new business models and platforms.\n\nGrowth curves are often associated with biology, allowing biologists to study organisms and how these organisms behave in a specific environment and the changes to that environment in a controlled setting.\n\nShifts in demographics, the nature of work, andartificial intelligencewill further strain conventional ways of analyzing growth curves or trends.\n\nAnalysis of growth curves plays an essential role in determining the future success of products, markets, and societies, both at the micro and macro levels.\n\nIn the image below, the growth curve displayed represents the growth of a population in millions over a span of decades. The shape of this growth curve indicates exponential growth. That is, the growth curve starts slowly, remains nearly flat for some time, and then curves sharply upwards, appearing almost vertical.\n\nThis curve follows the general formula:\n\nThe current value, V, of an initial starting point subject to exponential growth, can be determined by multiplying the starting value, S, by the sum of one plus the rate of interest, R, raised to the power of t, or the number of periods that have elapsed.\n\nIn finance, exponential growth appears most commonly in the context of compound interest.\n\nThe power of compounding is one of the most powerful forces in finance. This concept allows investors to create large sums with little initial capital. Savings accounts that carry acompoundinginterest rate are common examples.\n\nThe two types of growth curves are exponential growth curves and logarithmic growth curves. In an exponential growth curve, the slope grows greater and greater as time moves along. In a logarithmic growth curve, the slope grows sharply, and then over time the slope declines until it becomes flat.\n\nGrowth curves are a helpful visual representation of change over time. Growth curves can be used to understand a variety of changes over time, such as developmental and economic. They allow for the understanding of the effect of policies or treatments.\n\nA business growth model provides a visual representation for businesses to track various metrics and key drivers, allowing businesses to map out growth and adjust the businesses accordingly to foster these metrics.\n\nA growth curve is a graph that represents the way a phenomenon changes over time. It can show both the past and the future. They typically use two axes, where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is growth.\n\nGrowth curves are used in many disciplines, including sciences such as biology and ecology. They are also used in finance and economics. Businesses can use growth curves to see how a specific market is changing over time. This can help them decide whether to enter or leave a certain market or adjust their selling strategy to account for changes.\n\nCurran, Patrick J., Obeidat, Khawla, and Losardo, Diane, via National Library of Medicine. \"Twelve Frequently Asked Questions About Growth Curve Modeling: Abstract.\"Journal of Cognition and Development, vol. 11, no. 2, 2010.\n\nSigirli, Deniz and Ercan, Ilker. \"Examining Growth with Statistical Shape Analysis and Comparison of Growth Models.\"Journal of Modern Applied Statistical Methods, vol. 11, no. 2, November 2012, pp. 1.",
