This includes raw materials, components, and finished products, as well as the warehousing and processing of these items. There are different methods of inventory management, each with its pros and cons, depending on a company's needs.\n\nA company'sinventoryis one of its most valuable assets. In retail, manufacturing, food services, and other inventory-intensive sectors, a company's inputs (such as raw materials) and finished products are the core of its business. A shortage of inventory when and where it's needed can be extremely detrimental.\n\nAt the same time, inventory can be thought of as a liability (if not in an accounting sense). A large inventory carries the risk of spoilage, theft, damage, or shifts in demand. Inventory must be insured, and if it is not used up or sold in time it may have to be disposed of at clearance prices\u2014or simply destroyed.\n\nFor these reasons, inventory management is important for businesses of any size. Knowing when to restock, what quantities to purchase or produce, and when to sell and at what\u00a0price can easily become complex decisions. Small businesses will often keep track of stock manually and determine the reorder points and quantities\u00a0using spreadsheet (Excel) formulas. Larger businesses may use specializedenterprise resource planning (ERP)software. The largest corporations use highly customizedsoftware as a service (SaaS)applications. Companies are also calling on artificial intelligence to optimize these processes.\n\nAppropriate inventory management strategies vary depending on the industry. An oil depot is able to store large amounts of inventory for extended periods of time, allowing it to wait for demand to pick up if necessary. While storing oil is expensive and risky\u2014a fire in the U.K. in 2005 led to millions of pounds in damage and fines\u2014there is no risk that the inventory will spoil or go out of style. For businesses dealing in perishable goods or products for which demand is extremely time-sensitive\u20142024 calendars orfast-fashion items, for example\u2014sitting on inventory\u00a0is not an option, and misjudging the timing or quantities of orders can be costly.\n\nFor companies with complexsupply chainsand manufacturing processes, balancing the risks of inventory glut and shortages is especially difficult. To achieve these balances, they may call on several methods for inventory management, includingjust-in-time (JIT)andmaterials requirement planning (MRP).\n\nSome companies, such as financial services firms, do not have physical inventory and so instead rely on service process management.\n\nFor accounting purposes, inventory represents acurrent assetsince a company typically intends to sell its finished goods within a short period of time, usually no more than a year. Inventory has to be physically counted or measured before it can be put on a balance sheet. Companies often maintain sophisticatedinventory management systemscapable of tracking inventory levels in real time.\n\nInventory can be accounted for in several ways:first-in-first-out (FIFO)costing;last-in-first-out (LIFO)costing; orweighted-average costing. An inventory account typically consists of four separate categories:\n\nDepending on the type of business or the product involved, a company may use variousinventory management methods. These include just-in-time (JIT) manufacturing, materials requirement planning (MRP),economic order quantity (EOQ), anddays sales of inventory (DSI).\n\nWhile there are others, those are the four most common methods used to manage inventory. Here is how each one works.\n\nThis manufacturing and inventory management model originated in Japan in the 1960s and 1970s. Toyota Motor (TM) is credited with contributing the most to its development.JITallows companies to save significant amounts of money and reduce waste by purchasing and keeping\u00a0on hand only the inventory they need to produce and sell products within a certain time frame. This approach reduces storage and insurance costs, as well as the cost of liquidating or discarding excess inventory.\n\nJIT inventory management can be risky. If demand unexpectedly spikes, the manufacturer may not be able to source the inventory it needs to meet that demand, damaging its reputation with customers and driving business to competitors. Even the smallest delays can be disruptive; if a key input does not arrive \"just in time,\" a bottleneck can result.\n\nThis\u00a0inventory management method is sales-forecast dependent,\u00a0meaning that manufacturers rely on detailed sales records to anticipate their inventory needs and communicate those needs to suppliers in a timely manner.For example, a ski manufacturer using an MRP inventory system might ensure that materials such as plastic, fiberglass, wood, and aluminum are in stock based on forecasted orders. Inability to accurately forecast sales and plan inventory acquisitions will result in the manufacturer's inability to fulfill orders.\n\nThis model isused in inventory managementby calculating the number of units a company should add to its inventory with each batch order to reduce the total costs of its inventory while assuming constant consumer demand. The costs of inventory in the model include\u00a0holding\u00a0and setup costs.\n\nThe EOQ model seeks to ensure that the right amount of inventory is ordered per batch so a company does not have to make orders too frequently and there is not an excess of inventory sitting on hand. It assumes that there is a trade-off between inventory holding costs and inventory setup costs, and total inventory costs are minimized when both setup costs and holding costs are minimized.\n\nThis financial ratio indicates the average time in days that a company takes to turn its inventory, including goods that are a work in progress, into sales. DSI is also known as\u00a0the average age of inventory, days inventory outstanding (DIO), days in inventory (DII), days salesininventory, or days inventory and is interpreted in multiple ways.\n\nIndicating the liquidity of the inventory, the figure represents how many days a company's current stock of inventory will last. Generally, a lower DSI is preferred as it indicates a shorter duration to clear off the inventory, though the average DSI varies from one industry to another.\n\nIf a company frequently switches its method of inventory accounting without reasonable justification, it is likely its management is trying to paint a brighter picture than reality would indicate.\n\nFrequent inventory write-offs can mean that a company is having issues with selling its finished goods or with inventory obsolescence. This can also raise red flags regarding a company's ability to stay competitive and make products that appeal to consumers going forward.\n\nThe four main types of inventory management are just-in-time management (JIT), materials requirement planning (MRP), economic order quantity (EOQ), and days sales of inventory (DSI). Each method may work well for certain kinds of businesses and less so for others.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cookis known for his focus on inventory management. \"Inventory is like dairy products,\" he has been quoted as saying. \"No one wants to buy spoiled milk.\" Among other innovations, Cook brought just-in-time manufacturing practices to Apple, reportedly reducing its inventory turnover time from months to as little as five days.\n\nLet's look at an example of a just-in-time (JIT) inventory system. With this method, a company aims to receive goods as close as possible to when they are actually needed. So, if a car manufacturer needs to install airbags in its cars, it arranges to receive those airbags as the cars come onto the assembly line instead of having a stock of them on supply at all times.\n\nInventory management is a crucial part of business operations. Proper inventory management depends on the type of business and the products it sells. There may not be one perfect type of inventory management because there are pros and cons for each. But taking advantage of the most appropriate type of inventory management can go a long way toward ensuring a company's success.\n\nIBM. \"3 Ways AI Can Help Solve Inventory Management Challenges.\"\n\nToyota. \"Toyota Production System,\" Pages 1-2.\n\nChartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. \"Material Requirement Planning (MRP).\"\n\nGlobal Journal of Finance and Economic Management. \"Economic Order Quantity (EQQ) Model.\"\n\nThe Atlantic. \"Wow!
