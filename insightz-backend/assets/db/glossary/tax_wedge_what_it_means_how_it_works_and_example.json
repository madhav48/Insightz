  "term": "Tax Wedge: What It Means, How It Works, and Example",
  "definition": "A tax wedge is the difference between before-tax and after-tax wages. The tax wedge measures how much the government ostensibly receives as a result of taxing the labor force.\n\nTax wedge may also refer to the market inefficiency that is created when a tax is imposed on a good or service. The tax causes the supply and demand equilibrium to shift, creating a wedge of dead weight losses.\n\nMany employees havetaxes withheldfrom their paychecks, which means their take-home pay is less than thegross salaryor wage or the cost of employing them. The tax wedge is the difference between what employees take home in earnings and what it costs to employ them (labor cost), or the dollar measure of the income tax rate.\n\nTheOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)defines a tax wedge as the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker (a single person at 100% of average earnings) without children and the corresponding total labor cost for the employer.Some argue that the tax wedge oninvestment incomewill also reduce savings, and ultimately lower living standards.\n\nThe decrease in net income may lead to employees making a decision not to work as much or to find other ways to keep more of the income (by using government benefits, for example). While applications for government benefits rise, the workforce suffers as the employees who remain demand higher salaries, causing employers to decrease their hiring rate.\n\nIn some countries, the tax wedge increases as employeeincomeincreases. This reduces the marginal benefit of working; therefore, employees will often work less hours than they would if no tax was imposed. Thus, a tax wedge might be calculated to determine how higher payroll taxes ultimately affect hiring.\n\nFor example, assume an employee\u2019s gross income is $75,000 and he falls in the 15% and 5%tax bracketsfor federal and state income tax, respectively. Hisnet incomewill be $75,000 \u00d7 0.80 = $60,000. In a progressive tax system, at some point, income taxes are increased at both federal and state levels to 25% and 8%, respectively. Tax withheld from gross income is now $24,750, and net income is $75,000 - $24,750 (or $75,000 multiplied by 0.67) = $50,250.\n\nA tax wedge can also be used to calculate the percentage ofmarket inefficiencyintroduced by sales taxes. When a good or service is taxed, theequilibriumprice and quantity shift. The resulting price or quantity that deviates from the equilibrium is known as the tax wedge.\n\nThe market inefficiency that results from a tax wedge will cause the consumer to pay more and the producer to receive less for the good than they did before the tax, due to higher equilibrium prices paid by consumers and lower equilibrium quantities sold by producers. In effect, the sales tax effectively drives a \u201cwedge\u201d between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product.\n\nThe tax wedge measures how much the government ostensibly receives as a result of taxing the labor force.\n\nA tax wedge is defined as the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker (a single person at 100% of average earnings) without children and the corresponding total labor cost for the employer, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nA tax wedge is the net difference in gross income and net income after taxes have been deducted. The tax wedge measures how much the government ostensibly receives as a result of taxing the labor force. In progressive tax systems, the tax wedge increases on a marginal basis as income increases.\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. \u201cTax Wedge.\u201d",
