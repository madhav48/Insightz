  "term": "What Is Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI)? Benefits and Risks",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nForeign portfolio investment (FPI) involves investors holding financial assets, such as stocks and bonds, in another country to diversify their portfolios. Unlike direct investments, FPIs generally don't confer management control over the assets.\n\nForeign portfolio investment (FPI) consists of securities and other financial assets held by investors outside of their domestic market. It does not provide the investor with direct ownership of a company's assets and is relatively liquid, depending on thevolatilityof the market. Along withforeign direct investment(FDI), FPI is one of the common ways to invest in an overseas economy. FDI and FPI are both important sources of funding for most economies.\n\nPortfolio investmentinvolves the making and holding of a hands-off or passive investment of securities, done with the expectation of earning a return.\n\nIn foreign portfolio investment, these securities can include stocks, American depositary receipts (ADRs), or global depositary receipts of companies headquartered outside the investor's nation. Holding also includes bonds or other debt issued by these companies or foreign governments, mutual funds,\u00a0orexchange-traded funds(ETFs) that invest in assets abroad or overseas.\n\nAn individual investor interested in opportunities outside their own country is most likely to invest through an FPI. On a more macro level, foreign portfolio investment\u00a0is part of a country\u2019s capital account and shown on its balance of payments (BOP). The BOP measures the amount of money flowing from one country to another country over one monetary year.\n\nWith FPI, as with portfolio investment in general, an investor does not actively manage the investments or the companies that issue the investments. They do not have direct control over the assets or the businesses.\n\nIn contrast,foreign direct investment(FDI) lets an investor purchase a direct business interest in a foreign country. For example, say an investor based in New York City purchases a warehouse in Berlin to lease to a German company that needs space to expand its operations. The investor\u2019s goal is to create a long-term income stream while helping the company increase its profits.\n\nThis FDI investor controls their monetary investments and often actively manages the company into which they put money. The investor helps to build the business and waits to see their return on investment (ROI).\n\nFactors such as economic stability, growth prospects, favorable regulatory environments, and attractive returns draw FPIs into a country.\n\nHowever, because the investor\u2019s money is tied up in a company, they face less liquidity and more risk when trying to sell this interest. The investor also facescurrency exchange risk, which may decrease the value of the investment when converted from the country\u2019s currency to the home currency or U.S. dollars. An additional risk is political risk, which may make the foreign economy and its investment shaky.\n\nAlthough some of these risks affect foreign portfolio investments as well, they do so to a lesser degree than with foreign direct investments. Since the FPI investments are financial assets, not property or a direct stake in a company, they are inherently more marketable.\n\nSo FPI is more liquid than FDI and offers the investor a chance for a quicker return on their money, or a quicker exit. However, as with most investments offering a short-term horizon, FPI assets can suffer from volatility. FPI money often departs the country of investment whenever there is uncertainty or negative news in a foreign land, which can further aggravate economic problems there.\n\nForeign portfolio investments are more suited to the average retail investor, while FDI is more the province of institutional investors, ultra-high-net-worth individuals, and companies. However, these large investors may also use foreign portfolio investments.\n\nNo direct control/management of investments\n\nCause of economic disruption (if withdrawn)\n\nIndia has continued to attract significant foreign portfolio investments (FPIs). By mid-2025, according to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the number of registered FPIs is almost 12,000.\n\nThis continuous increase reflects investors' confidence in India's growth prospects, driven by robust economic reforms and the government's proactive policies aimed at improving the ease of doing business.\n\nA major example of FPI can also be seen in Brazil, which has also experienced a surge in foreign portfolio investments. Brazil has seen a remarkable influx of FPIs, with foreign investors significantly increasing their holdings in Brazilian equities.\n\nFactors contributing to this trend include favorable regulatory changes, a more stable macroeconomic environment, and potentially attractive returns offered by the Brazilian stock market.\n\nIf you're looking to diversify your portfolio, foreign portfolio investment can be a good way to start. It offers different investment opportunities, varied growth potential, and ahedgeagainst domestic markets.\n\nFPI allows you to gain exposure to other economies, like India, Brazil, or Japan, often through your regular brokerage account, without having to deal with foreign securities laws or too much paperwork.\n\nInvesting abroad is generally a fairly straightforward process, as you can invest in foreign stocks, bonds, or ETFs from your regular brokerage account, though some specific stocks might require more steps.\n\nFor passive investors looking to gain exposure to global trends, for example, if you think Asian markets are about to boom, FPI can be a simple and efficient way to test your market predictions.\n\nIt's worth noting that foreign markets come with all the same risks that domestic markets do, such as currency fluctuations and political changes, so always proceed with caution and balance your portfolio.\n\nRisks include currency fluctuations, political instability, different regulatory environments, and economic volatility in the foreign market.\n\nYes, retail investors can easily participate in FPI, often through mutual funds, ETFs, and other investment vehicles that provide exposure to foreign markets.\n\nInvestors can manage risks by broadly and effectively diversifying their investments across multiple countries and asset classes, and by staying informed about global economic and political developments.\n\nForeign portfolio investment (FPI) is crucial for globaldiversificationand provides investors access to international markets, enhancing their potential for higher returns. By holding assets such as stocks, bonds, and mutual funds from foreign countries, investors can spread risk and tap into diverse economic growth opportunities worldwide.\n\nSEBI. \"FPIs/Deemed FPIs (Erstwhile FIIs/QFIs).\"",
