They represent data points connected by a single line and typically show the ending periods of a security and economic data over a given period. Simple line charts are ideally used to track the price trend of a single asset over time. This helps identify general trends and patterns. You could use one to monitor the trend of the closing price of a stock over a year to assess its performance.\n\nThese charts involve plotting several lines on the same chart, each representing different data. This is useful for simultaneously comparing the performance of several securities, indexes, and other financial and economic metrics. Comparing the performance of various stocks, sectors, or markets to identify the relative strengths or weaknesses is an example of using multiple line charts.\n\nCompound line charts are also known as stacked line charts. They show the cumulative effect of several data sets stacked on top of each other.They're used to understand the combined effect of multiple factors on a single outcome or to analyze the composition of a metric over time.
