  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nUSDA streamlined\u00a0refinancing refers to a simplifiedmortgage-refinancing optionoffered through theU.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA streamlined refinancing is intended for homeowners who purchased their homes using a USDA-issued home loan and provides an option for borrowers to refinance for more affordable loan terms.\n\nTheUSDA loanis a mortgage option for some rural and suburban homebuyers. The USDA offers home loans directly and guarantees loans issued by qualifiedmortgage lenders. Qualification standards for these home loans are lenient compared to those of other mortgages. USDA loans are designed to help low- to moderate-income borrowers purchase homes in mostly rural areas. A Section 502 loan, which is a loan available to low-income individuals and households in rural areas, is one example of this type of loan.\n\nThe USDA has two programs to refinance direct and guaranteed loans\u2014streamlined-assist and standard streamlined.\n\nUSDA refinancing is similar to other federal streamlined refinancing options, such as theFederal Housing Administration's (FHA)streamlined refinancing,\u00a0Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) streamlined refinancing, andHome Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP)from government-sponsored enterprisesFannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n\nA streamlined refinanced loan even allows you to wrap your closing costs and escrow charges into the new loan amount. That helps homeowners receive a zero-out-of-pocket refinance, for which no cash is needed upfront.\n\nTwo popular USDA refinancing programs include thestreamlined assistand thestandard streamlinedprogram. With both programs, the refinanced interest rate must be equal to or below the current mortgage loan rate, and the mortgage must have closed 12 months prior to the loan application.\n\nThe USDA refinancing program, known as streamlined-assist have the following eligibility requirements:\n\nUnlike a typical loan application, there are nocredit report, home appraisal, orproperty inspectionrequirements. Current income is not a qualifying factor either. The borrower must only document that their income falls within current USDA limits.\n\nAnother refinancing program includes\u00a0theUSDA standard streamlined program. Similar to the streamlined-assist program, no appraisal is required, and homeowners underwater on their mortgage are eligible.\n\nThe benefits of this particular option include no requirement to drop the payment by at least $50, and existing borrowers listed on the note can be removed as long as one of the original borrowers remains on the loan. The latter can be beneficial in the case of divorce.\n\nTo refinance a guaranteed loan, check out theUSDA's list of approved lenders. They offer USDA loans, but the USDA does not recommend specific lenders. You'll need to shop around to ensure you get the best terms and a lower interest rate.\n\nThe interest rate for direct loans as of March 24, 2024, is 4.5%, but your effective rate can be as low as 1% after subsidies.\n\nThe USDA offers direct loans and guarantees loans from privatemortgage lendersto low- and moderate-income borrowers in rural areas. It oversees two programs to refinance these loans\u2014streamlined-assist and standard streamlined.\n\nUnder either program, the home to be refinanced must be a primary residence and have a mortgage from a USDA direct or guaranteed home loan, among other requirements. Neither requires a home appraisal or inspection. However, a standard refinance has more requirements than the streamlined-assist, including debt-to-income (DTI) ratio requirements.\n\nStreamlined refinancing offers a hassle-free way to refinance a USDA mortgage. The main benefit is lower loan payments.\n\nThe USDA streamlined refinancing option can help borrowers save money by refinancing their USDA mortgage loan. The streamlined program offers options for low- to moderate-income families located in mostly rural areas.\n\nBorrowers can also save on fees since a new appraisal or home inspection is not required. However, the borrower must have made on-time payments for the last 12 consecutive payments, and the refinancing must result in at least $50 per month in savings.\n\nUSDA Rural Development. \"Single Family Home Loan Opportunities.\"\n\nUSDA Rural Development. \u201cOptions to Refinance Direct and Guaranteed Loans.\u201d\n\nRocket Mortgage. \u201cUSDA Streamline Refinance: Everything You Need to Know.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \"Refinances Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program.\" Pages 14-15.\n\nUSDA Rural Development. \u201cStreamlined Assist Refinance Loans.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \"Refinances Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program.\" Page 13.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). \"Active Lenders.\"\n\nUSDA Rural Development. \"Single Family Housing Direct Home Loans.\"",
