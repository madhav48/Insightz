  "definition": "Electronic filing (e-file) is the process of submitting tax returns online using software or a tax professional rather than mailing paper forms.\n\nMore than 70% of American taxpayers now file theirincome tax returnselectronically over the Internet rather than mailing in paper forms.\n\nElectronic filing, or E-filing, requires usingtax preparation softwareor services. You can file your taxes yourself using platforms like TurboTax, TaxSlayer, or TaxAct, or you can go to an accountant who submits your return electronically.\n\nThe IRS also offers two free options:\n\nIts Direct File program. which allows people with relatively straightforward returns to file their taxes directly to the IRS for free is available to taxpayers in a total of 24 states for the 2025 tax year.However, the future of the Direct File program is uncertain as political opposition may lead to the program being cut in 2026.\n\nE-filing has become the norm thanks to its speed, accuracy, and convenience. The IRS encourages it because it reduces manual processing and helps taxpayers get theirrefundsfaster.\n\nEvery IRS form and its instructions can be downloaded from IRS.gov, but you can\u2019t submit them online without e-filing software.\n\nThe IRS's Direct File program allows taxpayers with relatively straightforward tax situations to complete and file their taxes directly with the IRS. Some common credits like theChild Tax Creditand retirement savings credits can be claimed through this system.\n\nFor the 2025 tax year, the Direct File option will be available to residents of a total of 24 states, and it will accommodate more taxpayers. For example, theHealth Savings Accountdeduction will be available through the program.\n\nTaxpayers withadjusted gross incomesfor the 2024 tax year of $79,000 or less can alternatively use the Free File site to access the free e-filing services of IRS software partners with guided tax preparation, including a Spanish-language option.\n\nA taxpayer has the option of filing the return using any tax preparation software with e-filing functionality or hiring the services of tax professionals who use similar software. The IRS Free File site has a search feature to help taxpayers find an authorized e-filing provider in their area.\n\nThis service is available for the 2024 tax year to people who live in the following states: Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington State, and Wyoming. Tax filers must submit state tax returns separately.\n\nThe 2025 tax season will be expanded to include residents of Alaska, Connecticut, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\u00a0and\u00a0Wisconsin.\n\nFor 2024, the process covers earned income from a W-2 form, Social Security income, unemployment income, and a few of the most common tax credits and deductions, including theEarned Income Tax Creditand the Child Tax Credit.\n\nDirect File will also cover a wider range of tax situations for the 2025 tax year, including Retirement Savings Contribution Credits and1099 forms for interest incomegreater than $1,500.\n\nThe 2025 process also will support claims for the\u00a0Child and Dependent Care Credit, Premium Tax Credit,\u00a0and Credit for the Elderly and Disabled.\u00a0Alaska residents also will be allowed to file the 1099 form for the Alaska Permanent Fund dividend.\n\nMore states may still be added, and several states have expressed interest or announced that they will participate in Direct File in 2026, assuming the program is not discontinued.\n\nRefer to theIRS websiteto see if you qualify.\n\nE-filing saves the tax agency time and money because it transmits a return's data directly to its computers, significantly reducing the labor of inputting data.Filing electronicallywith tax preparation software also reduces taxpayer calculation errors and missing entries, the IRS says.\n\nMost taxpayers who e-file and provide direct deposit information can expect to receive any refund they are due within 21 days if there are no issues with their tax return, according to the IRS.\n\nAnother benefit of e-filing is that the filer receives an acceptance or rejection notice within 48 hours\u2014usually within 24 hours\u2014of transmitting the tax return. Acceptance is proof that the documents have been received and are in the system, while a rejection alerts the taxpayer that the return has not been accepted by the IRS.\n\nThe rejection notice will include information on what needs to be corrected on the return to make it acceptable. If you e-filed before the tax due date but are rejected after it, there is a five-day grace period for correcting and resubmitting your return.\n\nThe IRS recommends only taxpayers who are comfortable doing their own taxes e-file without help from a professional.\n\nIRS Free File is only available for returns for the most recent tax year. Prior-year returns going back two years can still be filed electronically by registered tax preparers.\n\nThe IRS accepts e-filed returns for the most recent year until a November cutoff date typically announced in October, subject to the same timeliness rules as paper returns.\n\nAn electronic filing can be rejected over mistakes in entering a Social Security number or a payer's identification number, an omitted form, or a misspelled name. Returns can typically be e-filed again once such errors are fixed, the IRS says.\n\nIf all else fails and the deadline looms,send in a paper return instead.\n\nUnderstanding how to e-file your taxes can save you time, money, and stress each tax season. If you're filing your own return, knowing about IRS Free File or Direct File could mean paying nothing to file. You\u2019ll also get your refund faster\u2014usually within 21 days\u2014if you use e-file and choose direct deposit.\n\nIf you're switching jobs, changing income, or moving states, being aware of the programs available to you can help you stay on top of your finances and avoid costly mistakes like missing out oneligible deductions or credits. Whether you do your own taxes or hire help, choosing e-file helps ensure your return is filed accurately and on time.\n\nThe simplest way to electronically file your taxes is by using software such as TurboTax or TaxAct, among many others. These services allow you to fill in the information item by item, guided by instructions and prompts supplied by the software. Once complete, the software allows you to send off your return to the IRS. If eligible, you can file your federal return for free using software approved by the IRS for its Free File program.If it's available in your state, you can use the Direct File program and send your return straight to the IRS.\n\nThere are no real disadvantages to e-filing taxes. Most tax software saves your information even if you accidentally close out of the program or your computer crashes. If your taxes are extremely complex, you might want to have an accountant do the work to make sure you're getting all the details right. In either case, you'll be filing electronically.\n\nYour tax return for the 2024 tax year is due on Tuesday, April 15, 2025.\n\nTaxes for the 2025 tax year will be due on Wednesday, April 15, 2026.\n\nE-filing is a fast, safe, and reliable way to submit your tax return.
