Stocks typically trade in round lots,or orders of at least 100 shares. To buy a stock priced at $60 pershare, you will need $6,000 in your account. A broker may let you borrow half of that money, but you still need to produce the other $3,000. To trade options and futures, those trade by the contract. A contract represents some unit of the underlying security. In the options market, one contract is good for 100 shares of the stock.\n\nResults vary widely depending on various trading strategies,risk managementpractices, and amounts of capital available for day trading.
