The forint is issued and managed by Magyar Nemzeti Bank, the country'scentral bank. The forint is represented in the international market by the currency code HUF and the symbol Ft. The currency was introduced in Hungary in 1946.Banknotes are issued in denominations between Ft500 and Ft20,000 while the bank mints coins ranging in value from Ft5 to Ft200.\n\nThe forint is Hungary's official, national currency. It is issued by the country's central bank, the Hungarian National Bank, which is commonly known asMagyar Nemzeti Bank.Established in 1924, the bank is responsible for maintaining the currency's value and controlling itscirculation.Its main objectives are to \"achieve and maintain price stability\" while usingmonetary policyto support the federal government's economic policies.\n\nThe forint is denoted in theforeign exchange marketas Ft and is commonly referred to by its abbreviation HUF.It is notpeggedto any currency and no currencies are pegged to it either.Along with the euro, the currency's top currency exchange is the U.S. dollar.\n\nForintbanknotesare issued indenominationsof 500, 1,000, 2,000, 5,000, 10,000, and 20,000 forints.Coins are issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200 forints.Bills are printed by the Hungarian Banknote Printing Company while coins are minted by the Hungarian Mint.One forint is divided into 100fill\u00e9r.

There was significant support to join the union at the time when the country applied\u00a010 years earlier. However, Hungary still doesn't use the euro and hasn't set a target date to make the switch because the federal government and the central bank are reluctant to adopt the common currency.The nation's central bank governor Gyorgy Matolcsy described the euro as a \"trap\" and a \"strategic error.\"\n\nOtherEuropean countries that don't use the euroinclude Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Romania, though the European community is seeking more participants through economic integration.The2007-08 financial crisisand theEuropean sovereign debt crisismagnified the dangers of joining theeurozone, in which 19 of the 27 EU member countries adopted the single currency.By giving up control of their ownmonetary policy, countries such as Greece and Spain are unable to devalue their currencies to stimulate economic growth.\n\nAlthough theeuroisn't used in Hungary, some merchants accept it\u2014notably large hotels and merchants. The exchange rate is generally lower than most exchange offices. Change is normally given in forints.\n\nThe Hungarian forint was first used between 1868 and 1892. But it wasn't until 1946 that the modern forint was introduced.It was meant to stabilize the national economy following World War II. The name comes from the gold coins of Florence calledfiorino d'oro,which were struck beginning in 1252 and used throughout the Austro-Hungarian empire.\n\nThe currency'sexchange ratehas been stable to some extent. But uncertainty in the nation's economy has plagued the value of the forint in the foreign exchange market. For instance:\n\nHungary relies on a skilledlabor forceto drive its export-oriented economy. Major trading partners include Germany, Slovakia, Italy, Romania, and Austria. Top industries include car and car parts manufacturing and producing components for radios and televisions.\n\nAccording toWorld Bankdata, Hungary reportedgross domestic product (GDP)growth of 4.6% in and 14.6% inflation in 2022.This was primarily due to the economic fallout that resulted from the global COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAlthough Hungary is part of the European Union, it is not part of the euro area. This means it doesn't use the euro as its currency. Rather, it continues to use the forint. Hungary is reluctant to adopt the euro and has no target date to do so. According to the European Union, the forint is not part of the Exchange Rate Mechanism, which ensures that fluctuations in the exchange rate between the forint and euro \"do not disrupt economic stability within the single market.\"\n\nThe forint is the only national currency in Hungary, which means the euro is not recognized as an official currency. There are, however, some businesses that accept the euro as a transactional currency, such as hotels and other merchants\u2014especially those in major cities. Change, though, is issued in the local currency. Keep in mind, though, that the exchange rate through these merchants may be lower than those offered at financial institutions and licensed currency exchanges.\n\nU.S. dollars are not accepted in Hungary for day-to-day transactions. If you're traveling to the country, you should consider exchanging your U.S. currency for the forint, which is the country's only national currency.\n\nAlthough Hungary is part of the European Union, it is one of a handful of countries that continues to use its own currency rather than the euro.
