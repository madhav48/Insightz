  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nGemini is a global cryptocurrency exchange. Founded in 2014, the Gemini Exchange, also known as theGemini Trust Company, is the brainchild of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the famous investors, twins, and Harvard classmates of Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers announced the launch of Gemini in early 2014, although the exchange did not go live until October 2015.\n\nAs of Q2 2022, Gemini operates in more than 60 countries, including the U.S., U.K., and Canada.Like other digital currency exchanges, Gemini allows users to buy and sell various digital currencies, either with digital currency (for example, using bitcoin to buy litecoin) or using fiat currency like U.S. dollars to buy digital currencies.\n\nGemini is the astrological sign representing twins.\n\nGemini boasts a diverse range of products for small investors and advanced traders, offering features like charting and instant trades. Gemini Exchange is Gemini's platform for buying and selling cryptocurrency. It is available both through web browsers and as an app. The mobile app also includes the Gemini Wallet, which allows users to pay for goods using their crypto holdings.\n\nFor advanced traders, Gemini offers its Active Trader Platform. According to itswebsite, the platform features \"advanced charting, multiple order types, auctions, and block trading.\" They also claim to be able to execute orders in \"microseconds,\" but that may depend on how you define \"execute\" and what kind of cryptocurrency you're trading.\n\nTheGemini Custodyproduct is both a cold storage system for assets held by Gemini and a \"crypto-native finance platform.\" The custody product is unique in providing insurance coverage of $200 million for crypto holdings. It is a fiduciary and custodian licensed under New York Banking law, making Gemini arguably the most secure crypto exchange that has ever existed. Gemini also is a clearinghouse for off-exchange trades.\n\nThe Gemini dollar (GUSD) is Gemini'sstablecoinbased on the U.S. dollar. Users can spend GUSD or a few other select cryptocurrencies withGemini Pay, a function built into the Gemini app.\n\nThe Gemini Exchange set itself apart in early May 2016 when it became the first licensedEthereumexchange in the United States.In May 2018, Gemini became the world's first exchange to be licensed to offer Zcash trading as well.This announcement followed a report that Gemini began offering block trading in April 2018, allowing users to buy and sell large orders of digital currencies outside Gemini's usual order books. Block trading was implemented in order to create additional liquidity opportunities.\n\nGemini has expanded its partnerships with other organizations and companies. The most notable of these is Gemini's partnership with Nasdaq, announced in April 2018. Through this collaboration, Gemini can utilize Nasdaq's SMARTS technology in order to weed out fraudulent activity and manipulation of digital currency prices. Besides the Nasdaq partnership, Gemini also partnered with Caspian, the digital currency trading and risk-management service.\n\nAs with most digital currency exchanges, Gemini has seen its share of issues. In late November 2017, for instance, Gemini crashed for several hours due to unusually high demands on its website.Rival exchange Coinbasealso crashed around the same time. In response, Gemini representatives wrote on the company blog to indicate that \"this is not the firstscalingchallenge we've encountered, and it won't be the last,\" adding that the exchange is \"continuing to improve our performance and infrastructure monitoring so we can anticipate potential problems more quickly in the future.\"\n\nGemini has worked to ensure compliance with federal and state regulations regarding the sale and purchase of digital currencies. As such, the company markets itself as a \"New Yorktrust companyregulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services.\"\n\nAs of September 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission's lawsuit against the exchange continues. Additionally, one of its lending partners, Genesis, and its parent, Digital Currency Group, filed for bankruptcy in 2023. Gemini Earn members are at the top of its creditor's list, with more than $765 million owed to them.\n\nGemini used Genesis Global, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, as a lender. Genesis declared bankruptcy in January 2023, withholding funds for Gemini's Earn program. Thousands of Gemini customers were unable to withdraw funds as Gemini froze its withdrawals\u2014all of which followed the collapse of FTX, which had impacted Gemini financially as well.\n\nGemini and Coinbase are both cryptocurrency exchanges, but they offer different services. Which is better depends on how each serves your needs.\n\nGemini is headquartered in New York, United States but is available to users globally.\n\nThe Gemini exchange is one of a handful of cryptocurrency exchanges available to U.S. crypto users. Similar to all exchanges in the U.S., it is subject to several issues that stem from regulatory concerns, business relationships, and other general cryptocurrency issues. It is one of the most popular exchanges and is owned by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.\n\nGemini. \"Areas of Availability.\"\n\nGemini. \"Gemini Launches Captive Insurance Company - Now Has the Most Custody Insurance Coverage in the Crypto Market.\"\n\nGemini. \"Gemini Is Now the World's First Licensed Ether Exchange!\"\n\nGemini. \"Gemini Is Now the World's First Licensed Zcash Exchange!\"\n\nGemini. \"Introducing Gemini Block Trading.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"Gemini To Launch Market Surveillance Technology in Collaboration With Nasdaq.\"\n\nGemini. \"2017 Production Outages Update.\"\n\nKroll Restructuring Administration. \"Voluntary Petition for Non-Individuals Filing for Bankruptcy,\" Page 12.
