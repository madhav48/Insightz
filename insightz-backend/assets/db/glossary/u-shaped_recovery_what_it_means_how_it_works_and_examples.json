  "definition": "A U-shaped recovery is a type of economic recovery with a recessionary decline followed by a period of stagnation then a gradual rise back to its previous peak.\n\nA U-shaped recovery is a type of economic recession and recovery that resembles a U shape when certain economic measures are charted, such as employment, gross domestic product (GDP), and industrial output.\n\nThe U shape occurs when theeconomyexperiences a sharp decline in these metrics without a clearly defined trough, but instead a period of stagnation followed by a rise back to its previous peak.\n\nA U-shaped recovery describes a type of economicrecessionandrecoverythat charts a U shape, established when certain metrics such as employment,GDP, and industrial output sharply decline and then remain depressed before they bounce back again.\n\nA U-shaped rescission features a steep decline in economic output followed by a relatively longer trough than a V-shaped recession, followed by a longer recovery out of that trough. The downturn here is usually deeper and longer than that of a V-shaped recession.\n\nEconomists tend to categorize U shapes into three stages: the recessionary part of the downturn, the economic trough, and the slower but more lasting economic recovery.\n\nIn the early stages of a U shape,economistsmay wrongly assume that the worst is over and the economy has bottomed out. However, the longer it takes to recover, the more likely the setback will be more severe than originally anticipated. As the recession drags on, companies experience more trouble in paying their bills, and some may have to declarebankruptcy.\n\nDuring the recovery period, banks are typically reluctant to lend more money to firms, and consumers do not spend freely until they see signs that the economy is recovering, once again increasingconsumer confidence. Although spending is a key driver of the economy, it takes time for consumers to feel comfortable again about spending their money. Businesses must wait for the economic climate to improve before bringing on additional workers. With fewer jobs available,unemploymenttends to increase during such recovery periods.\n\nMeanwhile, a V-shaped recovery may reach the same trough but quickly rebound in a matter of weeks or a few months, rather than dragging out for longer.\n\nRecession shapes are shorthand concepts used by economists to characterize various types of recessions. Any number of recession and recovery types may conceivably be charted, although the most common shapes include U-shaped, V-shaped, W-shaped, and L-shaped.\n\nOf the U.S. recessions charted since 1945, approximately half have been described by economists as U-shaped, including the 1973\u201375 recession and the 1990\u201391 recession.\n\nOne of the most notable U-shaped recessions in U.S. history was the 1973\u201375 recession. The economy began to shrink in early 1973 and continued to decline or show only slight growth over the next two years, with the GDP dipping 3% at its deepest point before finally recovering in 1975.\n\nThe roots of this recession lay in the inflationary policies of the preceding years, simultaneously financing the Vietnam War and theGreat Societyexpansion under President Lyndon Johnson,Keynesian deficit spendingpolicies under President Richard Nixon after him, and the resulting break of the last links between the U.S. dollar and gold.\n\nThe onset of the recession was marked by:\n\nThe recovery was marked by persistently high unemployment and accelerating inflation which would characterize the 1970s as the era ofstagflation.\n\nThe deregulation of banks andsavings and loans (S&L)in the early 1980s kicked off a boom in commercial and residential real estate lending that really took off as the Federal Reserve loosenedmonetary policyand interest rates fell after the economy emerged from a recession in 1982. Thisboom would build into a debt bubbleof risky mortgages and shady banking practices that burst in the late 1980s in a debacle known as theS&L crisis.\n\nThe resulting massive losses, debt deflation, and bank failures across the real estate and financial sector led to recession for the broader economy in mid-1990. Although mild GDP growth reappeared the following year, job losses continued and unemployment rose through mid-1992, and total employment did not regain its pre-recession level until 1993.Because of this, the recovery from the 1990\u201391 recession has been dubbed the Jobless Recovery, and it can be considered an example of a U-shaped recovery.\n\nMany economists have characterized the economic downturn and recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as K-shaped, whereby certainindustriessuffered (such as travel and hospitality) while others saw positive growth (such as internet communications and online streaming).\n\nU- and V-shaped recessions feature a sharp decline followed by a somewhat symmetrical recovery. The main difference is in how long the economy remains depressed at its trough: a V shape remains there for only a short period with a quick rebound, while a U shape remains there for longer before recovering.\n\nSince 1857, the United States has had 34 recessions, ranging in length from two months (February to April 2020) to more than five years (October 1873 to March 1879). In the six instances since 1980, the average recession lasted less than 10 months.\n\nA U-shaped recession and recovery is characterized by an initial drop in economic output followed by an extended period of decline and then a slower but eventual economic expansion. It is sometimes hard to tell if the economy has bottomed out or if things will get worse before they get better.\n\nCongressional Research Service, via EveryCRSReport.com. \u201cThe Current Economic Recession: How Long, How Deep, and How Different from the Past?,\u201d Page 11 (Page 14 of PDF).\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cCharting the Labor Market: Data from the Current Population Survey (CPS),\u201d Pages 8 and 13.\n\nMichael Dalton et al., via Springer Link. \u201cThe K-Shaped Recovery: Examining the Diverging Fortunes of Workers in the Recovery from the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Business and Household Survey Microdata.\u201dThe Journal of Economic Inequality,\u00a0vol. 19, no. 3, 2021, pp. 527\u2013550.\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cU.S. Business Cycle Expansions and Contractions.\u201d",
