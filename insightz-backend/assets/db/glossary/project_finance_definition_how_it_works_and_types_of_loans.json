  "definition": "Project finance funds long-term infrastructure, industrial projects, and public services using\u00a0a nonrecourse or limited-recoursefinancial structure. The\u00a0debt and equity used to finance the project are repaid solely from the cash flow generated by the project itself.\n\nIn project finance, the loan structure relies primarily on the project's cash flow for repayment, with the project's assets, rights, and interests serving as secondary collateral. This approach is especially attractive to the private sector because companies can fund major projectsoff-balance sheet (OBS), meaning the debt used to fund the project does not appear on the company's balance sheet and has no impact on its credit rating or borrowing capacity.\n\nIn the U.S., project financing offers businesses a way to secure funding for large-scale projects like infrastructure, telecommunications, and energy.\n\n\u201cProject finance\u201d refers tofinancing\u00a0long-termindustrial and infrastructure projects, particularly in sectors like oil and gas, power generation, and transportation. It's also used to finance certain economic bodies likespecial purpose vehicles (SPVs), which are created to manage a single project.\u00a0The funding required for these projects is based entirely on the projected cash flows.\n\nSome of the common sponsors of project finance include the following entities:\n\nThe project finance\u00a0structure for abuild, operate, and transfer (BOT)project includes multiple key elements. Project finance for BOT projects generally includes an SPV.\u00a0The company\u2019s sole activity is carrying out the project by subcontracting most aspects through construction and operations contracts. Since new-build projects don't generate revenue during the construction phase, debt service begins only in the operations phase.\n\nThis creates significant risks during the construction phase, as the only revenue stream might come from anofftake agreementor power purchase agreement.\u00a0Because there's limited or no recourse to the project\u2019s sponsors, company shareholders are typically liable up to the extent of their investment. This structure keeps the project off the balance sheets of both the sponsors and the government, minimizing financial risk.\n\nNot all infrastructure investments are funded with project finance. Many companies issue traditional debt or equity to undertake such projects.\n\nProjectdebtis typically held in a sufficient minority subsidiary and not consolidated on the respective shareholders' balance sheets. This reduces the project\u2019s impact on the shareholders\u2019 existing debt and debt capacity cost, and the shareholders are free to use their debt capacity for other investments.\n\nGovernments may also use project financing to keep project debt and liabilities off their balance sheets, so they take up less fiscal space.Fiscal space is the amount of money the government may spend beyond what it already invests in public services such as health, welfare, and education. Governments can create fiscal space by raising taxes, cutting lower-priority spending, or securing external grants, but they must do so carefully to ensure long-term economic sustainability.The theory is that strongeconomic growthwill boost tax revenues, allowing the government to increase spending on public services.\n\nWhen a companydefaultson a loan, recourse financing gives lenders full claim to shareholders\u2019 assets or cash flow. In contrast, project financing designates the project company as alimited liabilitySPV. If the project company defaults, the lenders\u2019 recourse is thus limited primarily or entirely to the project\u2019s assets, including completion and performance guarantees and bonds.\n\nA key consideration in nonrecourse financing is whether there are circumstances under which lenders could access shareholders' assets. For example, if shareholders deliberately breach the terms of the agreement, the lender may have recourse to their assets.\n\nApplicable law may restrict the extent to which shareholder liability may be limited. For example, liability for personal injury or death is typically not subject to elimination. Nonrecourse debt is characterized by highcapital expenditures (CapEx), long loan periods, and uncertain revenue streams. Underwriting these loans requires\u00a0financial modeling\u00a0skills and sound knowledge of the underlying technical domain.\n\nTo reduce the risk of deficiency balances,\u00a0lenders typically limit loan-to-value (LTV)\u00a0ratios to 60% innonrecourse loans.As a result, borrowers face stricter credit standards, and the loans carry higher interest rates than recourse loans, reflecting their greater risk.\n\nIf two people purchase large assets, such as homes, and one has a recourse loan while the other has a nonrecourse loan, the financial institution's actions against each borrower will differ.\n\nIn both cases, the homes may becollateral, meaning they can be seized should either borrower default. To recoup costs when the borrowers default, the financial institutions can attempt to sell the homes and use the sale price to pay down the associated debt. However, if the homes are sold for less than the amount owed, the lender can pursue the borrower with a recourse loan for the remaining debt. In contrast, the borrower with the nonrecourse loan can't be held liable for any additional payment beyond the seizure of the property.\n\nProject andcorporate financeare important concepts in the world of financing. Both of these funding methods rely on debt and equity to help businesses reach their financing goals, but they are very distinct.\n\nProject finance can be very capital-intensive and risky, and it relies on the project\u2019s cash flow for repayment in the future. On the other hand, corporate finance focuses on boostingshareholder valuethrough various strategies, such as capital investment and taxation. Unlike project financing, shareholders receive an ownership stake in the company with corporate financing.\n\nSome of the key features of corporate financing include:\n\nProject finance is a way for companies to raise money to realize opportunities for growth. This type of funding is generally meant for large, long-term projects. It relies on the project\u2019s cash flows to repay sponsors or investors.\n\nSome risks associated with project finance include volume, financial, and operational risk. Volume risk can be attributed to supply or consumption changes, competition, or changes in output prices. Inflation, foreign exchange, and interest rates often lead to financial risk. A company\u2019s operating performance often defines operational risk, the cost of raw materials, and maintenance, among others.\n\nProject finance is a way for companies to fund long-term projects. This form of financing uses a nonrecourse orlimited-recourse financial structure. Firms with weakbalance sheetsare more apt to use project finance to meet their funding needs rather than trying to raise capital on their own. This is especially true for smaller companies and startups that have large-scale projects on the horizon.\n\nProject finance is a form of funding best suited for large, long-term projects like major infrastructure improvements or industrial developments. It relies on the project's estimated future cash flow for repayment with minimal recourse. This allows companies to take on bigger projects without negatively impacting their balance sheets.\n\nProject finance may carry higher risks due to its reliance on future income streams. However, it also offers a way to fund businesses in sectors where traditional corporate finance may not work or even be an option.\n\nInternational Trade Administration. \"Project Financing.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Recourse vs. Nonrecourse Debt.\"\n\nAfrican Legal Support Facility. \"General Debt Financing Versus Project Financing.\"\n\nCambridge University Press. \"Financing PPP and the Fundamentals of Project Finance.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Back to Basics.
