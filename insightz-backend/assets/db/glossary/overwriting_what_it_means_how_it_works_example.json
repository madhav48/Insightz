  "definition": "Overwriting is a trading strategy that involves sellingoptionsthat are believed to be overpriced, with the assumption that the options won't get exercised before they expire.\n\nOverwriting is a speculative strategy that some option\u00a0writers may employ to collect a premium even\u00a0when they believe theunderlying securityis incorrectly valued, hoping that they do not getassignedthe short options. Investors may also refer to the strategy as \"overriding.\"\n\nThewriter(seller) of an option has an obligation to deliver their shares to the buyer if the buyer\u00a0decides toexercisethe option, while the holder/buyer of an option has the right but not the obligation to purchase the seller'ssharesat a specific price within a specified time. Overwriting is a technique used by speculative option writers in an attempt to profit from the premiums paid by option buyers for option\u00a0contracts the writer hopes will expire without being exercised. Overwriting\u00a0is considered risky and should only be attempted by investors who have a comprehensive understanding of options and options strategies.\n\nOverwriting can help investors who hold adividend-paying stockto increase their income by collecting the premium they receive from writing an option against the stock they own. For example, if they currently receive a 3% dividend yield, they could increase that yield to effectively more than 10% by overwriting.\u00a0The strategy is most effective when stock prices have had a sharp decline and premiums get overvalued, as the\u00a0higher premiums help offset possible further losses.\n\nThe downside risk to overwriting is that if the stock\u2019s price rises sharply, the seller loses any profit they\u00a0would have made above the options strike price. To combat this, the seller may want to buy the option back, although they\u00a0would most likely need to repurchase it at a higher price than what they\u00a0sold it for.\n\nSuppose an investor holds a stock that is trading at $50. They decide to write a $60 call option against it that expires in three months and they receive a $5 premium. The buyer will likely exercise thecall optionif the stock is trading above $60 before the expiry date, which limits the seller's profit to $15 a share (the difference between $50 and $60, plus the $5 premium) on an asset that may continue to rise in value. This is why the seller hopes that the call option will expire worthless\u2014they get to keep the premium already collected AND continue to hold an asset that is on the rise.\u00a0If the stock declines, the $5 premium the seller received\u00a0helps to partially offset any\u00a0loss incurred.",
