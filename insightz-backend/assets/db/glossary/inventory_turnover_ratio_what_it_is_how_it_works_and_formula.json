  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nInventory turnover ratio is a financial ratio showing how many times a company turned over itsinventoryin a given period. A company can then divide the days in the period, typically afiscal year, by the inventory turnover ratio to calculate how many days it takes, on average, to sell its inventory.\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio can help businesses make better decisions on pricing, manufacturing,marketing, andpurchasing. It is one of several commonefficiency ratiosthat companies can use to measure how effectively they use their assets.\n\nAs mentioned, the inventory turnover ratio measures the number of times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a certain period. A higher inventory ratio is usually better, although there may also be downsides to a high turnover.\n\nAnalyzing an inventory turnover ratio in conjunction with industry benchmarks and historical trends can provide valuable insights into a company's operational efficiency and competitiveness. On its own, the turnover ratio may not mean much. However, tracking it over time or comparing it against a similar company's ratio can be very useful.\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio is calculated as follows:\n\nInventory\u00a0Turnover=COGSAverage\u00a0Value\u00a0of\u00a0Inventorywhere:COGS=Cost\u00a0of\u00a0goods\u00a0sold\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Inventory Turnover} = \\frac{ \\text{COGS} }{ \\text{Average Value of Inventory} } \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &\\text{COGS} = \\text{Cost of goods sold} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bInventory\u00a0Turnover=Average\u00a0Value\u00a0of\u00a0InventoryCOGS\u200bwhere:COGS=Cost\u00a0of\u00a0goods\u00a0sold\u200b\n\nCost of goods sold (COGS)is also known as cost of sales.Analysts use COGS instead of sales in the formula for inventory turnover because inventory is typically valued at cost, whereas the sales figure includes the company'smarkup. Some companies may use sales instead of COGS in the calculation, which would tend to inflate the resulting ratio.\n\nAdditionally,average value of inventoryis used to offsetseasonalityeffects. It is calculated by adding the value of inventory at the end of a period to the value of inventory at the end of the prior period and dividing the sum by 2.\n\nA low inventory turnover ratio might be a sign of weak sales or excessive inventory, also known as overstocking. It could indicate a problem with a retail chain'smerchandisingstrategy or inadequate marketing. Simply put, a low inventory turnover ratio means the product is not flying off the shelves, for whatever reason.\n\nAhigh inventory turnover ratio, on the other hand, suggests strong sales. Alternatively, it could be the result of insufficient inventory. As problems go, ensuring that a company has sufficient inventory to support strong sales is a better one to have than needing to scale down inventory because business is lagging.\n\nThe speed with which a company can turn over inventory is a critical measure of business performance. Retailers that turn inventory into sales faster tend to outperform comparable competitors.\n\nThefast fashionbusiness is an example. Competitors such as H&M and Zara typically limit runs and replace depleted inventory quickly with new items. Slow-selling items equate to higher holding costs. There is also theopportunity costof low inventory turnover; an item that takes a long time to sell delays the stocking of new merchandise that might prove more popular.\n\nA decline in the inventory turnover ratio may signal diminished demand, leading businesses to reduce output.\n\nA low inventory turnover ratio can be an advantage during periods ofinflationorsupply chaindisruptions, if it reflects an inventory increase ahead of supplier price hikes or higher demand. For example, retail inventories fell sharply in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving the industry scrambling to meet demand during the ensuing recovery.\n\nInventory turnover is an especially important piece of data for maximizing efficiency in the sale of perishable and other time-sensitive goods. Examples include groceries, fashion, autos, and periodicals. An overabundance of cashmere sweaters, for instance, may lead to unsold inventory and lost profits, especially as seasons change and retailers restock accordingly. Such unsold stock is known asobsolete inventory, or dead stock.\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio can be one way of better understanding dead stock. In theory, if a company is not selling a lot of a particular product, the COGS of that good will be very low (since COGS is only recognized upon a sale). Therefore, products with a low turnover ratio should be evaluated periodically to see if the stock is obsolete.\n\nTheinventory-to-saIes ratiois the inverse of the inventory turnover ratio, with the additional distinction that it compares inventories with net sales rather than the cost of sales. A higher inventory-to-sales ratio suggests that the company may be holding excess inventory relative to its sales volume, meaning there may be inefficiencies in its inventory management. A lower inventory-to-sales ratio implies that the company has a leaner inventory position relative to its sales, which may reflect tighter control over inventory levels and/or more efficient allocation of resources.\n\nAnother ratio inverse to inventory turnover isdays sales of inventory (DSI), which marks the average number of days it takes to turn inventory into sales. DSI is calculated as average value of inventory divided by cost of sales or COGS, and multiplied by 365. Companies tend to want to have a lower DSI, and they usually want that DSI to be sufficient to cover short-term cash needs.\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio is a valuable metric for many companies. However, it also has limitations that need to be taken into account:\n\nFor fiscal year 2022, Walmart Inc. (WMT) reported cost of sales of $429 billion and year-end inventory of $56.5 billion, up from $44.9 billion a year earlier.Walmart\u2019s inventory turnover ratio for the year was:\n\n2022: $429 billion \u00f7 [($56.5 billion + $44.9 billion)/2], or about 8.5\n\nDividing the 365 days in the year by 8.5 shows that Walmart turned over its inventory about every 42 days on average.\n\nFast-forward to 2024, Walmart reported cost of sales of $490 billion for the fiscal year ending January 2024. It also reported ending inventory of $54.9 billion, up from $56.6 billion a year earlier.So its inventory turnover ratio for 2024 was:\n\n2024: $490 billion \u00f7 [($54.9 billion + $56.6 billion)/2], or about 8.8\n\nThis signals that from 2022 to 2024, Walmart increased its inventory turnover ratio. Dividing the 365 days in the year by 8.8 shows that Walmart turned over its inventory about every 41 days on average.\n\nIn instances like this, management should further explore the cause. It may be due to more efficient processes, or it may be due to more demand for the products it offers. However, very generally speaking, the movement of this ratio from 2022 to 2024 in Walmart's case appears to be positive.\n\nThe inventory turnover ratio is a financial metric that measures how many times a company's inventory is sold and replaced over a specific period, indicating its efficiency in managing inventory and generating sales from it.\n\nInventory turnover is calculated by dividing a company's cost of sales, or cost of goods sold (COGS), by the average value of its inventory over two recent consecutive periods.\n\nWhat counts as a \"good\" inventory turnover ratio will depend on thebenchmarkfor a given industry. In general, industries stocking products that are relatively inexpensive will tend to have higher inventory turnover ratios than those sellingbig-ticket items.Inventory and accounts receivableturnover ratios are extremely important tocompanies in the consumer packaged goods sector.\n\nCompanies will almost always aspire to have a high inventory turnover. After all, high inventory turnover reduces the amount of capital that they have tied up in their inventory. It also helps increase profitability by increasing revenue relative to fixed costs such as store leases, as well as the cost of labor. In some cases, however, high inventory turnover can be a sign of inadequate inventory that is costing the company potential sales.\n\nSome retailers may employ open-to-buy purchase budgeting orinventory management softwareto ensure that they're stocking enough to maximize sales without wasting capital or taking unnecessary risks. Companies with localized supply chains and short productionlead timesmay also use apull-through productionsystem, which procures the production materials and starts manufacturing only after a customer orders the finished product.\n\nA company's inventory turnover ratio reveals the number of times that it turned over its inventory in a given time period. This ratio is useful to a business in guiding its decisions regarding pricing, manufacturing, marketing, and purchasing. It is of particular importance in retail.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Beginners' Guide to Financial Statement.\"\n\nNikkei Asia. \"Japan Electronic Parts Makers' Rising Stocks Stoke Production Cut Fears.\"\n\nThe White House. \"Why the Pandemic Has Disrupted Supply Chains.\"\n\nReady Ratios. \"Inventory Turnover (Days) \u2014 Breakdown by Industry.\"\n\nWalmart. \"2022 Annual Report,\" Pages 53 and 55 (Pages 55 and 57 of PDF).\n\nWalmart. \"2024 Annual Report,\" Pages 54 and 56 (Pages 56 and 58 of PDF).",
