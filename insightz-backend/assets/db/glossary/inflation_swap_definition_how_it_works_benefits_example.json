  "definition": "An inflation swap is a contract used to transferinflation riskfrom one party to another through an exchange of fixed cash flows.\n\nIn an inflation swap, one party pays a fixed rate cash flow on a notional principal amount\u00a0while the other party pays a floating rate linked to an inflation index, such as theConsumer Price Index(CPI). The party paying the floating rate pays the inflation-adjusted rate multiplied by thenotional principal amount. Usually, the\u00a0principal does not change hands. Each cash flow comprises one\u00a0leg of the swap.\n\nInflation swaps are used by financial professionals to mitigate(hedge)the risk of inflation and to use the price fluctuations to their advantage. Many types of institutions find inflation swaps to be valuable tools. Payers of inflation are typically institutions that receive inflation cash flows as\u00a0their core line\u00a0of business. A good example\u00a0might be\u00a0a\u00a0utility company because\u00a0its\u00a0income is linked (either explicitly or implicitly) toinflation.\n\nOne party to an inflation swap will receive a variable (floating) payment linked to an inflation rate and pay an amount based on a fixed rate ofinterest, while the other party will pay that inflation rate linked payment and receive the fixed interest rate payment. Notional amounts are used to calculate the payment streams.Zero-coupon swapsare most common, where the cash flows are swapped only at maturity.\n\nAs with other swaps, an inflation swap initially values atpar, or face value. As interest and inflation rates change, the value of the swap's outstanding floating payments will change to be either positive or negative. At predetermined times, the market value of the swap is calculated. Acounterpartywill post collateral to the other party and vice versa, depending on the value of the swap.\n\nThe advantage of an inflation swap is that it provides an analyst with a fairly accurate estimation of what the market considers to be the \"break-even\" inflation rate. Conceptually, it is very similar to the way that a market sets the price for anycommodity, namely the agreement between a buyer and a seller (between demand and supply) to transact at a specified rate. In this case, the specified rate is the expected rate of inflation.\n\nSimply put, the two parties to the swap come to an agreement based on their respective takes on what the inflation rate is likely to be for the period of time in question. As withinterest rate swaps, the parties exchange cash flows based on a notional principal amount (this amount is not actually exchanged), but instead of hedging against or speculating oninterest rate risk, their focus is solely on the inflation rate.\n\nAn example of an inflation swap would be an investor purchasingcommercial paper. At the same time, the investor enters into an inflation swap contract,\u00a0receiving\u00a0a fixed rate and paying a floating rate linked to inflation.\n\nBy entering into an inflation swap, the investor effectively turns the inflation component of the commercial paper from floating to fixed. The commercial paper gives the investor realLIBORpluscredit spreadand\u00a0a floating inflation rate, which the investor exchanges for a fixed rate with a counterparty.",
