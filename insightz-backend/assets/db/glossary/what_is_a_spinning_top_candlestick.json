  "term": "What Is a Spinning Top Candlestick?",
  "definition": "A spinning top is a\u00a0candlestick\u00a0pattern with a short\u00a0real body\u00a0that's vertically centered between long upper and lower shadows. This means that neither buyers nor sellers are gaining the upper hand.\n\nSpinning top candlesticks are characterized by compact bodies and long upper and lower shadows, resembling a child's toy top. These formations occur when bulls and bears engage in a tug-of-war, with neither side gaining a significant advantage during a trading period.\n\nCandlestick patterns form when the buyers push the price up during a given period, and the sellers push the price down at the same time, but ultimately, the\u00a0closing price\u00a0ends up very close to the\u00a0open. For their part, spinning tops can signal a potential price reversal after a strong price advance or decline if the following candle confirms. A spinning top can have a close above or below the open, but the two prices are always close together.\n\nSpinning tops are a sign of indecision in the asset; the long upper and lower shadows indicate there wasn't a meaningful change in price between the open and close. Thebullssent the price sharply higher, and thebearssent the price lower, but in the end, the price closed\u00a0near where it opened. This indecision can signal more sideways movement, especially if the spinning top occurs within an established range. It can also signal a possible price reversal if it occurs following a price advance or decline.\n\nSometimes, spinning tops may signal a significant trend change. A spinning top\u00a0at the top of an uptrend could signify that bulls are losing control, and the trend may reverse. Similarly, a spinning top at the bottom of a downtrend could signal that bears are losing control, and bulls may take the reins.\n\nIn any case, confirmation helps clarify what the spinning top is saying. The confirmation comes from the next candle. If traders believe that the spinning top after an uptrend could result in a reversal to the downside, the candle that follows the spinning top might be a bearish one with a lower close. If it doesn't, the reversal will not be confirmed, and the trader won't need to wait for another trade signal. If the spinning top occurs within a range, this indicates indecision is still prevalent, and the range will likely continue. The following candle would confirm it if it stays within the established sideways trend.\n\nSpinning tops are a common candlestick pattern, and they work best with other forms of technical analysis. For example, traders may look at technical indicators, like themoving average convergence-divergenceor relative strength index, for signs of a reversal before taking a trade based on a spinning top. Indicators or other forms of analysis, such as those helping to identify support and resistance, may help make better decisions based on candlestick patterns.\n\nThe chart above shows several spinning tops. On the left, the first one occurs after a small price decline. It's followed by a down candle, indicating a further price slide. The price heads a bit lower but then reverses to the upside. If taking trades based on candlesticks, this highlights the importance of having aplanand managing riskafterthe formation of the candlestick pattern.\n\nThe second spinning top occurs within a range. Since the price continues to head sideways, it confirms the market's present indecision.\n\nThe third spinning top is exceptionally large compared with the candles around it. It occurred after an advance and was followed by a large down candle. This ended up being a reversal candle, given that the price proceeded lower.\n\nAs the price was dropping, another spinning top formed. It ended up being a brief pause as the next candlegappedlower, and the price continued falling.\n\nThese examples highlight the importance of confirmation and context. Spinning tops within ranges typically help confirm the range and the market's indecision. Spinning tops within trends may be reversal signals, but the following candle must confirm thebreakoutorbreakdown.\n\nSpinning top candlesticks are common, which means many patterns will be inconsequential. Since assets often have periods of indecision, this makes sense. Spinning tops frequently occur when the price is already movingsidewaysor is about to start.\n\nAs for forecasting reversals, the commonality of spinning tops also makes this problematic. Many spinning tops won't result in a reversal. Confirmation is required, but even with confirmation, there is no assurance the price will continue in the new direction.\n\nTrading around a spinning top can also pose some problems since the candle can be quite large, from high to low. If confirmation comes after a spinning top and a trade is taken, placing astop lossabove or below the high/low of the spinning top could result in a large risk which may not justify the potential reward.\n\nAssessing the reward potential of a spinning top trade is also difficult since the candlestick pattern do not provide aprice targetor exit plan. Traders should use other candlestick patterns, strategies, or indicators to find a profitable exit.\n\nIf the spinning top occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, it could signal that a bullish reversal may happen. Conversely, if the spinning top occurs at the top of an uptrend, it could suggest a bearish reversal.\n\nSpinning tops anddojisboth represent indecision. Dojis are smaller, with small real bodies and small upper and lower shadows. The spinning top has long upper and lower shadows. Both patterns occur often and are sometimes used to warn of a reversal after a strong price move. Both types of candlesticks rely heavily on confirmation. A strong move after the spinning top or doji tells more about the new potential price direction than the spinning top or doji itself.\n\nA candlestick is a type of price chart used in technical analysis. It displays the high, low, open, and closing prices of a security over a specific period of time. The wide part of the candlestick is called the \"real body\" and tells investors whether the closing price was higher or lower than the opening price.\n\nThe spinning top candlestick pattern represents indecision and uncertainty about an asset's future direction. It indicates that the bulls sent the price higher while the bears pushed it back down, resulting in no meaningful change in price. However, a spinning top can signify a future price reversal if confirmed by the following candle.\n\nThe spinning top is considered a common candlestick pattern, and trading with it is like trading other candlestick formations: traders should combine it with other candlestick patterns and indicators to find profitable exits.",
