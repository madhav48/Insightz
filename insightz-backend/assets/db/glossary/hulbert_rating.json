  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA Hulbert rating is a score that tracks the performance of aninvestment newsletterover time. Investment newsletters are paid subscriptions that can offer investors a variety of market-related information, such as trading strategies, stock recommendations, and economic commentary. Some newsletters focus on specific industries or types of trading, such as options trading, investing in utilities, precious metals investing, or cryptocurrency investing. Hulbert Ratings, LLC assigns Hulbert ratings and encourages investors to judge a newsletter by its long-termperformance adjusted for risk.\n\nThe Hulbert ratings of investment newsletters are determined by maintaining hypothetical investmentportfoliosaccording to the buy and sell advice of each newsletter. Hulbert Ratings, LLC then tracks the performance of the newsletter by multiple metrics, culminating in aSharpe ratio, a measure of risk-adjusted performance.\n\nFinancial advisor andcontrarianinvestor Mark Hulbert began tracking newsletter performance in theHulbert Financial Digestin 1980. After nearly 36 years, and a couple of high-profile acquisitions,Hulbert Financial Digestwas officially laid to rest in Jan. 2016. Hulbert immediately formed Hulbert Ratings LLC, which picked up where the digest left off and which continues to track newsletter performance. Newsletters pay Hulbert Ratings LLC a flat fee to be tracked and audited.\n\nHulbert establishes an impartial evaluation of each newsletter by subscribing under someone else\u2019s name to prevent the newsletter from sending their tips early and inflating the performance of the hypothetical portfolio. Some newsletters are less specific in their calls to action than others are. For those, Hulbert Ratings, LLC must infer buy and sell advice to track returns.\n\nAside from their value as an impartial review of newsletter performance, the very existence of Hulbert ratings helps keep newsletters (also known asmarket letters) honest about their performance.\n\nHulbert ratings appear on the performance scoreboards published on the Hulbert Ratings LLC website. The site publishes performance scoreboards that show newsletter ratings for the most recent 12-month period and historical ratings over thetrailing3, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 years. Listed newsletter performance ratings go as far back as the inception of the service in 1980.\n\nThe Hulbert Investment Newsletter Honor Roll lists those investment newsletters that have produced above-average performance in both up and down markets. The list grades each newsletter's performance during up and down periods, showing the gain for each newsletter since April 2000.\n\nEach newsletter is given a risk number, which reflects thevolatilityof the newsletter\u2019s performance, as measured by the standard deviation of its monthly returns. Additionally, each newsletter is given a risk-adjusted performance number calculated using the Sharpe ratio.\n\nAfter decades of Hulbert ratings, one thing is clear. Most newsletters, like most actively managed mutual funds,underperformthe market. Hulbert himself has come to agree with the conventional but hard-to-follow wisdom that, for all the sophisticated hedging techniques and analytical instruments available, an investor\u2019s best bet is to dump a sum of money into anindex fundand hold it. Hulbert has even gone so far as to suggest that virtually all changes investors make to their portfolios are mistakes.\n\nThat said, Hulbert has defended newsletters as useful given the weakness of human psychology. Specifically, Hulbert views the average investor as incapable of following the index fund strategy, because the average investor will panic in adown marketand end up selling low. Hulbert prefers consistently following a suboptimal strategy, namely acting on the buy and sell advice of an investment newsletter, compared to inconsistently following the optimal strategy, which is to invest in an index fund and hold\u00a0during downturns.\n\nNot everyone agrees, but when deciding on investment strategies investors should remember the truism that most actively managed funds and portfolios underperform the market.\n\nHulbert Ratings. \"About.\" Accessed Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nHulbert Ratings. \"About.\" Accessed Aug. 18, 2021\n\nHulbert Ratings. \"Investment Newsletter Performance.\" Accessed Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nHulbert Ratings. \"Performance Scoreboards.\" Accessed Aug. 18, 2021.\n\nHulbert Ratings. \"The Hulbert 2020-2021 Investment Newsletter Honor Roll.\" Accessed Aug. 18, 2021.",
