  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nUnsubordinated debt, also known as a senior security orsenior debt, refers to a type of obligation that must be repaid before any other form of debt. So, holders of unsubordinated debt have the first claim over a company'sassetsor earnings if the debtor goes bankrupt or insolvent. Because unsubordinated debt comes with a guarantee of repayment, they are considered less risky than other types of debt.\n\nWhen a company goes bankrupt or insolvent, there is normally a chain or ranking of creditors who get paid in a specific order. Lenders of unsubordinated debt get paid out in full first by the company. The majority of this type of debt is usually secured bycollateral.\n\nMost loans from financial institutions and certain high-grade debt securities such asmortgage bondsare deemed senior debt. Loans are also considered unsubordinated based on the balance and the length of time outstanding in comparison with other loans.\n\nBecause senior debt has a relatively secure claim, it is considered to be less risky. As such, it pays a lower rate of interest compared to other types of debt. This means lenders are willing to compensate for lower borrowing rates by claiming a higher priority over a borrower\u2019s assets since they will be repaid first during a liquidation event.\n\nBecause they come with some security, unsubordinated debt lenders normally charge lower interest rates to their debtors.\n\nAfter unsubordinated debt lenders are paid, any remaining money goes topreferred stockholders, subordinated debt, followed by common shareholders.\n\nExamples of unsubordinated debt includeexchange-traded notes(ETNs), collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Collateralized securities such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are structured with a number oftranchesthat bear different risks, interest rates, and maturities. Tranches with a higher claim on underlying assets are safer than junior tranches with a second lien. Senior tranches also have a higher credit rating than junior tranches and are paid first.\n\nUnsubordinated debt is the opposite ofsubordinated debt. This type of debt vehicle is ranked below all senior debts of a company. Subordinated debt is also called junior debt, and is subject to subordination in the event of default orbankruptcy.\n\nWhen a company\u2019s assets areliquidatedto pay off its debt obligations, subordinated debt holders receive payment after all unsubordinated debt lenders and preferred stockholders are paid. In some cases, there is no cash left after paying the unsubordinated lenders, which means every other creditor remains unpaid.\n\nBecause there ismore risk associated with subordinated debt, these lenders normally charge higher interest rates compared to unsubordinated debt.",
