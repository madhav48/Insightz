Each\u00a0is appointed\u00a0to a single 14-year term, but may serve shorter or longer periods. A new board member serves the remainder of the outgoing member\u2019s term, if any. The latest member may then be reappointed to one full term.\n\nIf a replacement has not been confirmed when that term expires, they may continue to serve, so that it is possible for a member to serve for much longer than 14 years. However, the president is allowed to remove a member from the board, given sufficient cause. Terms are staggered so that a new member is appointed every two years.Once appointed, each board member operates independently.\n\nThe chair, vice chair, and vice chair for supervision of the Federal Reserve Board are appointed to four-year terms by the president from among the board\u2019s existing members. They can be reappointed to these leadership roles as often as their board member term limits allow.\n\nThe board of governors includes several subcommittees with their chairs and vice chairs. These are the committees on Board Affairs, consumer and community affairs, economic and monetary affairs, financial stability, Federal Reserve Bank affairs, supervision and regulation, payments, clearing, and settlement, and the subcommittee on smaller regional and community banking.\n\nHere is the current list of Federal Reserve Board members:\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board members\u2019 most important role is as members of theFederal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which oversees the open market operations that determine the amount of money circulating.

At board meetings, the chairman presides, and in the chairman\u2019s absence, the vice chairman takes over. If both the chair and vice chair are absent, the board can elect a member to act as chair pro tempore.\n\nFunds collected through assessments on Federal Reserve banks are used to cover expenses and salaries of board members. Board members are prohibited from holding positions or stock in banks, banking institutions, or trust companies. Each board member must certify this fact under oath as part of their service.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Board serves as the entity that promotes price stability, sustainable economic growth, and maximum employment. It does this by implementing monetary policies\u2014the tools it's created to influence interest rates and the supply of money.\n\nThe Federal Reserve Chair is a Level I executive schedule position, and makes $250,6000.
