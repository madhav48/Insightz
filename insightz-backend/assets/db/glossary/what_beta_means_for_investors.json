  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nAmanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nBeta is a widely used indicator of the price volatility, or the level of risk, of a stock relative to the broader market.\n\nBeta is an indicator of the price volatility of a stock or other asset in comparison with the broader market. It suggests the level of risk that an investor takes on in buying the stock. The higher the beta number, the higher the risk.\n\nThe market that the stock trades in, such as the S&P 500, always has a beta of 1.0. A number above one indicates that the stock's price swings more, up or down, than the market in general. A number below one indicates its price is more stable.\n\nThe current beta of any stock can usually be found on the summary page of its listing on any financial website or stock trading site.\n\nAbetacoefficient shows the volatility of an individual stock compared to the systematic risk of the entire market. Beta represents the slope of the line through a regression of data points. In finance, each point represents an individual stock's returns against the market.\n\nBeta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market. It is used in thecapital asset pricing model(CAPM), which describes the relationship between systematic risk and expected return for assets. CAPM is used to price risky securities and to estimate the expected returns of assets, considering the risk of those assets and the cost of capital.\n\nA security's beta is calculated by dividing the product of thecovarianceof the security's returns and the market's returns by thevarianceof the market's returns over a specified period. Thecalculationhelps investors understand whether a stock moves in the same direction as the rest of the market. It also provides insights into how volatile\u2014or how risky\u2014a stock is relative to the rest of the market.\n\nFor beta to provide useful insight, the market used as abenchmark should be relatedto the stock. For example, a bond ETF's beta with the S&P 500 as the benchmark would not be helpful to an investor because bonds and stocks are too dissimilar.\n\nBeta\u00a0coefficient(\u03b2)=Covariance(Re,Rm)Variance(Rm)where:Re=the\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0an\u00a0individual\u00a0stockRm=the\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0overall\u00a0marketCovariance=how\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0stock\u2019s\u00a0returns\u00a0arerelated\u00a0to\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0market\u2019s\u00a0returnsVariance=how\u00a0far\u00a0the\u00a0market\u2019s\u00a0data\u00a0points\u00a0spreadout\u00a0from\u00a0their\u00a0average\u00a0value\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Beta coefficient}(\\beta) = \\frac{\\text{Covariance}(R_e, R_m)}{\\text{Variance}(R_m)} \\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &R_e=\\text{the return on an individual stock}\\\\ &R_m=\\text{the return on the overall market}\\\\ &\\text{Covariance}=\\text{how changes in a stock's returns are} \\\\ &\\text{related to changes in the market's returns}\\\\ &\\text{Variance}=\\text{how far the market's data points spread} \\\\ &\\text{out from their average value} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bBeta\u00a0coefficient(\u03b2)=Variance(Rm\u200b)Covariance(Re\u200b,Rm\u200b)\u200bwhere:Re\u200b=the\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0an\u00a0individual\u00a0stockRm\u200b=the\u00a0return\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0overall\u00a0marketCovariance=how\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0a\u00a0stock\u2019s\u00a0returns\u00a0arerelated\u00a0to\u00a0changes\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0market\u2019s\u00a0returnsVariance=how\u00a0far\u00a0the\u00a0market\u2019s\u00a0data\u00a0points\u00a0spreadout\u00a0from\u00a0their\u00a0average\u00a0value\u200b\n\nAn investor uses beta to gauge how much risk a stock adds to a portfolio. While a stock that deviates very little from the market doesn\u2019t add a lot of risk to a portfolio, it also doesn\u2019t increase the potential for greater returns.\n\nInvestors must ensure that a specific stock is compared to the right benchmark and review the R-squared value relative to the benchmark.R-squaredis a statistical measure that compares the security's historical price movements to the benchmark index.\n\nA security with a high R-squared value indicates a relevant benchmark. A goldexchange-traded fund(ETF), such as the SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), is tied to the performance of gold bullion. Consequently, a gold ETF would have a low beta and R-squared relationship with the S&P 500.\n\nInvestors commonly evaluate two categories of risk. Systematic risk is the risk of the entire market declining, also known as undiversifiable risk.Unsystematic, or diversifiable risk, is the uncertainty associated with an individual stock or industry. It is the risk related to a company or sector and can be mitigated through diversification.\n\nA stock's beta will change over time as it relates a stock's performance to the returns of the overall market.\n\nThe beta coefficient theory assumes that stock returns are normally distributed from a statistical perspective. In reality, returns aren\u2019t always normally distributed. Therefore, what a stock's beta might predict about a stock\u2019s future movement may prove untrue.\n\nA stock with a verylow beta could have smaller price swings, yet still be in a long-term downtrend. So, adding a down-trending stock with a low beta decreases the risk in a portfolio only if the investor defines risk strictly in terms of volatility and not potential losses.\n\nSimilarly, a high beta stock that is volatile in a mostly upward direction will increase the risk of a portfolio, but it may increase gains. Investors who use beta to evaluate a stock also evaluate it from other perspectives, such as fundamental or technical factors, before assuming it will add or remove risk from a portfolio.\n\nWhile beta can offer useful information when evaluating a stock, it does have some limitations. Beta can determine a security's short-term risk and analyze volatility. However, beta is calculated using historical data points and is less meaningful for investors looking to predict a stock's future movements for long-term investments. A stock's volatility can change significantly over time, depending on a company's growth stage and other factors.\n\nBeta can provide some risk information, but it is not an effective measure of risk. Beta only looks at a stock's past performance relative to the S&P 500 and does not predict future moves. It also does not consider the fundamentals of a company or its earnings and growth potential.\n\nA Beta of 1.0 for a stock means it has been as volatile as the broader market. If the index moves up or down 1%, so too would the stock, on average. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility. So if the beta were 1.5 and the index moved up or down 1%, the stock would have moved 1.5%, on average. Betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility; if the stock had a beta of 0.5, it would have risen or fallen just half a percent as the index moved 1%.\n\nBeta (\u03b2) is the second letter of the Greek alphabet used to measure the volatility of a security or portfolio compared to the S&P 500, which has a beta of 1.0. A Beta of 1.0 shows that a stock has been as volatile as the broader market. Betas larger than 1.0 indicate greater volatility, and betas less than 1.0 indicate less volatility.\n\nWorld Gold Council. \"GLD SPDR Gold Shares.\"",
