  "definition": "Price to tangible book value (PTBV) is a valuation ratio used to compare the price of a security with the company\u2019s physical assets as reported in itsbalance sheet.\n\nThe tangible book value number includes all physical assets but excludesintangible assetssuch as goodwill, patents, intellectual property, and trademarks. Since intangibles are excluded, PTBV is considered a more accurate estimate of the company\u2019s net value to shareholders, after debts are paid, in the event of liquidation.\n\nA company\u2019stangible assetsare the things of value that it owns. Examples include machinery, equipment, raw materials, inventories, vehicles, and buildings.\n\nIn theory, a stock\u2019s tangible book value per share represents the amount of money an investor would receive for each share if a company were to cease operations andliquidateall of its assets at the value recorded on the company\u2019s accounting books. In fact, in the event of a liquidation, common-stock shareholders are last in line to be repaid, after all of the company\u2019s creditors.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, stocks that trade at higher PTBV ratios have the potential to leave investors with greater share price losses than those that trade at lower ratios, since the tangible book value per share can reasonably be viewed as the lowest price at which a stock could trade.\n\nPTBV is applicable mainly to industrial orcapital-intensivecompanies like auto manufacturers and oil refiners. These companies have hard assets of high value.\n\nPTBV is relatively meaningless as a valuation measure in the technology sector, for instance, because much of a tech company\u2019s valuation derives from its intellectual property\u2014an intangible asset.\n\nCalculating PTBV can be tricky in some instances, such as for companies that have land that has been held for decades. The land is stated on the books at itshistorical cost, not marked up each year on the balance sheet, resulting in a deceptively high PTBV ratio.\n\nAs of the quarter ending June 30, 2023, the tangible book value of General Motors was about $71 billion (total net assets of\u00a0$276 billion less $5 billion of goodwill and intangible assets minus about $200 billion in liabilities).\n\nThere were $1.4 billion in shares outstanding, yielding a tangible book value per share of about $50.7.\n\nThe closing price per share of GM on the last trading day of 2023 was $35.72.Therefore, PTBV on the last trading day of 2023 was $35.72/$50.7, or $0.70.\n\nAn analyst could study the trend of this ratio or compare it with those of itspeer group.\n\nPTBV and price-to-book (P/B) are nearly identical, except P/B includes the value of all assets, including intangible assets. PTBV excludes intangible assets such as intellectual property and goodwill.\n\nMany of today\u2019s public companies derive most of their value from intangible assets and may not have very many tangible assets on their balance sheet. Thus, PTBV is not a reasonable way to measure the company\u2019s value.\n\nPTBV is most useful when evaluating capital-intensive companies that rely on hard assets, such as manufacturers or mining companies.\n\nPTBV represents the market value of a company\u2019s shares as a multiple against the amount it would receive if it was forced to sell off all of its hard assets.\n\nPrice to tangible book value (PTBV) is one of many calculations that analysts may use in an effort to pinpoint the fair value of a public company\u2019s stock.\n\nIt is not particularly relevant to some companies, such as today\u2019s technology giants, because their true value lies in their intangible assets such as their intellectual property and patents.\n\nIt is more relevant when considering a manufacturer such as General Motors, or anycompanythat relies heavily on its investments in machinery, equipment, or buildings.\n\nCorrection\u2014July 26, 2024:This article was corrected to update GM\u2019s closing price per share to the last trading day of 2023 and the subsequent PTBV figures.\n\nGeneral Motors Investor Relations. \u201cForm 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 30, 2023,\u201d Page 2 (Page 4 of PDF).\n\nYahoo!
