  "term": "What (and Who) Is Next of Kin, and Why Does It Matter?",
  "definition": "Next of kin refers to a person's closest living relative(s). Individuals who count as next of kin include those with a blood relation, such as children, or those with legal standing, such as spouses or adopted children. A person's next of kin often takes precedence over others ininheritancecases, especially whena willisn't established.\n\nNext of kin refers to individuals who share a relationship through blood, marriage, or adoption. This relationship helps establish who would receive a portion of a person's estate by the laws of descent and distribution if there is nowill.In this context, the next of kin is the spouse.\n\nInheritancerights use the next of kin relationship for anyone who dies without a will and has no spouse or children.Surviving individuals may also have responsibilities during and after their relative's life. For example, the next of kin may need to make medical decisions if the person becomes incapacitated, or take responsibility for their funeral arrangements and financial affairs after their relative dies.\n\nA legally and properly executed will that covers inheritable property usually takes precedence over next of kin inheritance rights.\n\nIf the deceased person left no will, theirestatepasses to a surviving spouse in nearly all states.If the couple is divorced,postnuptial agreementsmay terminate or alter these rights. If a surviving spouse remarries, it generally does not affect their inheritance rights.\n\nIn the absence of a surviving spouse, the person who is next of kin inherits the estate. The line of inheritance begins with direct offspring, starting with their children, then their grandchildren, followed by any great-grandchildren, and so on.\n\nThe legal status of stepchildren and adopted children varies by jurisdiction. If the deceased had no offspring, the line of inheritance moves upward to their parents. If the parents are no longer alive, collateralheirs(brothers, sisters, nieces, and nephews) are next in line.\n\nThe specifics of determining next of kin and inheritance vary by jurisdiction. Matters involving inheritance in certain countries, such as the United Kingdom, are handled in accordance with various succession laws. In other countries, next of kin laws are in place for settling the estates of people who dieintestate.\n\nIn the United States, the right of a relative to inherit or receive property by inheritance exists through the operation of state laws and legislative action. State law establishes next of kin relationships and inheritance priorities.\n\nIdentifying a next of kin is less important, at least legally, if the person who died (the \"decedent\") left a will or was married.\n\nThe legislature of a state has plenary power, or complete authority, over the distribution of property within the state borders. The deceased's estate becomesstate propertyif no legal heir is identified.\n\nWhat if someone dies in one state and owns assets in another? Withpersonal property, the law of the state where the decedent resides generally supersedes the laws of other states.\n\nThe recipient(s) of proceeds from a decedent's life insurance policy, or their retirement accounts, such as401(k)sandindividual retirement accounts (IRA), are designated in a different way than other bequeathable assets. The funds from these instruments typically go to thebeneficiarieslisted by the decedent on these policies or the accounts themselves, even if the decedent designated different people in a will.\n\nNext of kin status is irrelevant unless the decedent was married and lived in acommunity propertystate. If so, by law, the surviving spouse is entitled to an equal portion of any funds earned or accrued during the marriage, unless the spouse had signed awaiver. If the spouse is also deceased, and there are no living listed beneficiaries, those assets may flow to the deceased's next of kin, depending on state law.\n\nCertain other rules apply to individuals whoinherit retirement plan assets. Those rules have been modified following the passage of theSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. Under the new law, IRA beneficiaries must cash out their inherited retirement account within 10 years. There are certain exceptions, such as for people who are chronically ill or disabled, and children under the age of 18.\n\nEstablishing someone's next of kin is also important for law enforcement, medical officials, and other authorities when they need to make notifications about an individual's death, health, or well-being.\n\nBeing designated as someone's next of kin carries significant legal responsibilities. One of the primary responsibilities of next of kin is to make decisions on behalf of the individual in case they become unable to make decisions for themselves. This could come up prior to that person's death, whether due to illness, injury, or incapacitation.\n\nThe next of kin can play a role in making serious healthcare decisions for the individual. This responsibility is particularly important when the individual is unable to communicate their wishes. Take a situation where someone is in a coma: the next of kin may be called upon to provide consent for medical treatments or end-of-life decisions.\n\nThe next of kin may also have legal responsibilities and authority. They may be tasked with handling the individual's assets, paying bills, and managing investments. This responsibility becomes much more prominent when there is no will.\n\nNext of kin andpower of attorneyare two distinct legal concepts that confer different roles for an individual. Next of kin typically serves as a default designation when there is no formal legal document specifying decision-making authority. On the other hand, a power of attorney is a legal document that grants one person authority to act on someone else's behalf.\n\nThe powers granted in a power of attorney can vary widely depending on the terms of the document. They often include managing financial affairs, making healthcare decisions, and conducting legal transactions. Note that the power of attorney documentation may be for specific actions. Being next of kin may designate a more broad, less defined set of responsibilities.\n\nAnother key difference between next of kin and power of attorney is the level of control and authority each confers. Being next of kin does not necessarily grant decision-making authority. You usually don't get this kind of power unless it's explicitly stated by law. A power of attorney, on the other hand, does grant explicit legal authority. It's a more formalized, enforceable way of designating responsibilities.\n\nEstablishing the next-of-kin relationship is important because it determines inheritance rights when a person dies without a will and there are no surviving relatives, such as a spouse or children.\n\nA person's next of kin may also have certain responsibilities during and after a person's life, such as making medical decisions, making funeral arrangements, and assuming control of financial affairs.\n\nDetermining the next of kin and inheritance varies by jurisdiction. In the United Kingdom, inheritance matters are handled as per succession laws.In other countries, the laws about next of kin help settle the estates of people who die intestate.The right of someone to inherit or receive property in the U.S. by inheritance exists by way ofstate lawsand legislative action.\n\nIn most cases, the next of kin status doesn't matter. This means that the proceeds from life insurance policies and retirement accounts are transferred to the beneficiaries named by a decedent, even if the decedent designates different people in their will.\n\nThis changes if the decedent is married and lives in a community property state. In this case, the surviving spouse is legally entitled to an equal portion of any funds earned or accrued during the marriage, unless the spouse signs a waiver.\n\nNext of kin refers to a person's closest living relative, such as children or a spouse.\n\nInestate planning, next of kin is important in that next of kin typically takes precedence over any other individuals for an inheritance, usually when a will does not exist.\n\nEach country (and sometimes different jurisdictions within the country) have different inheritance rights. Most often, the spouse inherits the estate. If there is no spouse, then it is usually the children. If there are no children, the next of kin relationship continues to find the closest living relative.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Next of Kin.\"\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Inheritance.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Introduction to Wills.\"\n\nKMPG. \"Recent Developments in Europe: International Estate and Succession Planning Trends.\"\n\nLegislation.Gov.UK. \"Intestates' Estates Act 1952.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"The Probate Process.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"FAQs About Retirement Plans and ERISA,\" Page 8.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Inherited or 'Stretch' Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and the SECURE Act.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Part 25.
