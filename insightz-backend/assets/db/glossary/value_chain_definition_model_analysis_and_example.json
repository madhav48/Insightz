  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA value chain is the full range of activities needed to create a product or service and make it available to consumers.\n\nA value chain is a series of consecutive steps that go into the creation of a finished product, from its initial design to its arrival at a customer\u2019s door. The chain identifies each step in the process at which value is added, including the sourcing, manufacturing, and marketing stages of its production.\n\nBecause of ever-increasing competition for lower prices, better products, and customer loyalty, companies must continually examine the value they create to retain theircompetitive advantage. Avalue chaincan help a company to discern areas of its business that are inefficient and implement strategies that willoptimize its proceduresfor maximum efficiency and profitability.\n\nIn addition to ensuring that production mechanics are seamless and efficient, businesses also need to keep customers confident and secure enough to remain loyal.Value chain analyses can helpwith this, too.\n\nMichael E. Porter, of Harvard Business School, introduced the concept of a value chain in his book, \u201cCompetitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance.\u201d He wrote: \u201cCompetitive advantage cannot be understood by looking at a firm as a whole. It stems from the many discrete activities a firm performs in designing, producing, marketing, delivering, and supporting its product.\u201d\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s important to maximize value at each specific point in a firm\u2019s processes.\n\nThe overarching goal of a value chain is to deliver the most value for the least cost in order to create a competitive advantage.\n\nIn his concept of a value chain, Porter splits a business\u2019s activities into two categories, primary and support, of which sample activities for each are listed below. Specific activities in each category will vary according to the industry.\n\nPrimary activities consist of five components, all essential for adding value and creating competitive advantage:\n\nThe role of support activities is to help make the primary activities more efficient. When you increase the efficiency of any of the four support activities, it benefits at least one of the five primary activities. These support activities are generally denoted as overhead costs on a company\u2019s income statement:\n\nA value chain example is the privately held grocery storeTrader Joe\u2019s, which received much press about its tremendous value and competitive edge. Because the company is private, there are many aspects of its strategy that we don\u2019t know. However, when you enter a Trader Joe\u2019s store, you can readily observe instances of Trader Joe\u2019s business that reflect the five primary activities of the value chain.\n\n1.Inbound logistics:Unlike traditional supermarkets, Trader Joe\u2019s does all of its receiving, shelving, and inventory during regular store hours. Although potentially maddening for shoppers, this system creates cost savings in terms of employee wages. Moreover, the logistics of having this work take place while customers are still shopping sends the strategic message that \u201cwe\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\n2.Operations:Here\u2019s an example of how a company could apply the value chain creatively. In primary activity number two above, \u201cconverting raw materials into finished product\u201d is cited as an \u201coperations\u201d activity. However, because converting raw materials is not an aspect of the supermarket industry, we can use operations to mean any other regular grocery store function. So, let\u2019s substitute \u201cproduct development,\u201d as that operation is critical for Trader Joe\u2019s.\n\nThe company selects its products carefully, featuring items that you generally can\u2019t find elsewhere. Itsprivate-labelproducts account for more than 80% of its offerings, which often have the highestprofit margins, since Trader Joe\u2019s can source them efficiently in volume. Another vital piece of product development for Trader Joe\u2019s is its taste-testing and chef-partnership programs, which ensure high quality and continuous product refinement.\n\n3.Outbound logistics:Many supermarkets offer home delivery, but Trader Joe\u2019s does not. But we can also apply the activity of outbound logistics to apply to the range of amenities that shoppers encounter once they are inside a Trader Joe\u2019s store. The company has thought carefully about the kind of experience it wants customers to have when visiting its stores.\n\nAmong Trader Joe\u2019s many tactical logistics are its in-store tastings. Usually, there are a few product tastings happening simultaneously, which create a lively atmosphere and often coincide with the seasons and holidays. The tasting stations feature new and familiar items prepared and served by staff.\n\n4.Marketing and sales:Compared to its competitors, Trader Joe\u2019s barely does any traditional marketing. However, its entire in-store experience is a form of marketing. The company\u2019s copywriters craft product labels to appeal specifically to its customer base. The unique branding and innovative culture of Trader Joe\u2019s indicate that the company knows its customers well. Which it should, as the firm has actually chosen the type of customers it prefers and has not deviated from that model.\n\nWith this indirect marketing of style and image, Trader Joe\u2019s has differentiated itself in the marketplace, thus sharpening its competitive edge.\n\n5.Service:Customer service is paramount for Trader Joe\u2019s. Generally, you see twice as many employees as shoppers in their stores. Whatever work they are doing at the moment, the staff are there primarily to help the customer. In addition, the company has a no-questions-asked refund program.\n\nA value chain is the sequence of steps involved in adding value to a product and making it desirable to consumers. Some of the steps are obvious, like manufacturing, packaging, and delivering the product. But it also includes steps after the sale, like marketing, providing customer service, repairing defective products, and offering refunds. All of these steps are important in creating a product that consumers want to buy.\n\nThe phrase \"value chain\" evokes a similarity with the term \"supply chain,\" referring to the sequence of manufacturing steps that go into a finished product. Much like supply chains, businesses need to study their value chains to find out where they can improve efficiency and make their products more attractive.\n\nAsupply chainis the system and resources needed to move a product or service from supplier to customer. A value chain expands on this, also taking into consideration how value is added\u00a0along the chain, including after the sale is finalized.\n\nAccording to Harvard Business School, the steps in value chain analysis are:\n\nYes. The term \u201cglobal value chain\u201d refers to production broken into activities and tasks carried out in different countries. A global value chain\u00a0is carried out by a transnational corporation, an enterprise composed of linked entities in two or more countries.\n\nA value chain is the consecutive steps that go into making a finished product, from the initial design to the customer\u2019s doorstep. The chain identifies each step in the process at which value is added.\n\nValue chain analysis is a company\u2019s evaluation of the detailed procedures involved in each step of its business. The analysis aims to increase production efficiency so that a company can deliver maximum value for the least possible cost.\n\nMichael E.
