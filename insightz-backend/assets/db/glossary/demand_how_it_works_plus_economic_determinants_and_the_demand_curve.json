  "definition": "Demand is a consumer's desire to purchase goods and services and willingness to pay a specific price for them.\n\nDemand is a consumer's willingness to buy something, and demand is generally related to the price that consumer would have to pay. Generally speaking, demand increases when prices drop and decreases when prices rise. Market demand is the total quantity demanded by all consumers in a market for a given good, and aggregate demand is the total demand for all goods and services in an economy.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nAs noted above, demand refers to how many goods and services a consumer purchases at a certain price. Shoppers tend tobuy more products and services when prices are low. When prices rise, shoppers buy fewer or perhaps none at all.\n\nBusinesses spend a lot of money to determine the demand for their products and services. Incorrect estimates can result in lost sales from willing buyers if demand is underestimated or losses from leftoverinventoryif demand is overestimated. Demand helps fuel profits and the economy. That's why it's an important concept.\n\nDemand is closely related to the concept ofsupply. While consumers try to pay the lowest prices they can for goods and services, suppliers try to maximize profits. Demand drops if suppliers charge too much for a product and suppliers may not sell enough to earn sufficient profits. If suppliers charge too little, the quantity demanded increases but lower prices may not cover suppliers\u2019 costs or allow for profits.\n\nSome factors affecting demand include the appeal of a good or service, the availability of competing goods, the availability of financing, and theperceived availabilityof a good or service.\n\nDemand elasticity relates to how sensitive the demand for a product is as its price changes. For example, if there's a big change in demand due to a small price change, demand elasticity is high. Shoppers may choose attractive substitute products if the price for their usual product has increased somewhat. That could indicate high demand elasticity and is useful for businesses to know.\n\nFive main factors drive demand:\n\nAs these factors change, so can the demand for a product or service. They change all the time, so demand can be constantly in flux.\n\nThe law of demand highlights theinverse relationshipbetween demand and prices. It states that when prices rise, demand will fall. Conversely, when prices fall, demand will rise.\n\nThe law of demand involves price only. None of the other drivers of demand mentioned above are involved. As such, things like consumer preferences, substitutes, and price expectations don't apply. If they do come into play, the functioning of the law can be affected. Demand can be seen to change for reasons other than price.\n\nAdemand curveis a graph that displays the change in demand resulting from a price change. It's a visual representation of the law of demand. It's a useful tool for businesses because it can show them the prices at which consumers buy more or less. It can point out prices at which a company can maintain consumer demand and support reasonable profits.\n\nThe vertical axis on a demand curve graph denotes the price, while the horizontal axis denotes thequantity demanded. Ademand schedule, or a table created by a business that lists the quantity of a product that consumers will buy at particular price points, can provide the figures for the demand curve chart.\n\nOnce plotted, the demand curve slopes downward, from left to right. As prices increase, consumers demand less of a good or service. Asupply curve, on the other hand, slopes upward. As prices increase, suppliers provide more of a good or service.\n\nThe point where supply and demand curves intersect represents the market clearing or market equilibrium price. An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right. The two curves then intersect at a higher price, which means consumers are willing to pay more for the product.\n\nEquilibrium pricestypically change for most goods and services because factors affecting supply and demand always change. Free, competitive markets tend to push prices toward market equilibrium.\n\nThe market for each good in an economy faces a different set of circumstances, which vary in type and degree. Inmacroeconomics, we also look at aggregate demand in an economy.Aggregate demandrefers to the total demand by all consumers for all goods and services in an economy across all the markets for individual goods.\n\nSince aggregate demand includes all goods in an economy, it is neither sensitive to competition, the substitution of goods, nor due to changes in consumer preferences between various goods. Demand in individual goods markets can be affected by these factors.\n\nFiscal and monetary authorities, such as theFederal Reserve, devote much of their macroeconomic policy-making to managing aggregate demand.\n\nIf the Fed wants to reduce demand, it can raise interest rates and increase prices by curtailing the growth of themoney supplyand credit. If it needs to increase demand, the Fed can lower interest rates and increase the money supply, giving consumers and businesses more money to spend.\n\nIn certain cases, even the Fed can\u2019t fuel demand. When unemployment is on the rise, people may not be able to afford to spend or take on cheaper debt, even with low interest rates.\n\nDemand is an economic concept that indicates how much of a good or service a person will buy based on its price. Demand can be categorized into various categories, but the most common are:\n\nThe demand curve is a graphical representation of the law of demand. It plots prices on a chart. The line that connects those prices is the demand curve. The vertical axis represents the prices of products. The horizontal axis represents product quantity. Typically, the curve starts on the left side high up the vertical axis, and descends across the chart to the right. The slope indicates that as prices decrease, demand, as shown by a growing number of products purchased, increases.\n\nEconomically speaking, the principle of demand is important for both consumers and businesses that sell products and/or services. For businesses, understanding demand is vital when making decisions about inventory, pricing, and aiming for a particular profit. Consumers who have an understanding of demand can make confident decisions about what products to buy and when to buy them.\n\nDemand is a core economic concept that shows how much of a good or service consumers are willing to buy at different prices. The concept is used by businesses to determine prices and used by consumers to know when to make a purchase. The demand curve visually depicts how demand changes in relation to price: when price increases, demand decreases; when price decreases, demand increases.\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"The Fed Explained What the Central Bank Does.\"",
