  "definition": "Bloomberg/\u00a0Contributor / Getty Images\n\nThe opening price is the cost of a security at the opening of an exchange.\n\nThe opening price of a stock or security is the first traded price of the day on a given market. While it may seem like just another number in a sea of financial data, the opening price is important in setting the tone for the day's trading. It also provides investors and analysts with vital information about the stock.\n\nUnderstanding what the opening price represents and why it's important can help traders make better decisions and better interpret market sentiment. Below, we explore the opening price further, including the trading strategies traders employ with the opening price in mind.\n\nExchanges may differ slightly, but they are mostly like the Nasdaq, which uses the \"opening cross\" to calculate opening prices based on orders that came in overnight. Before the market officially opens, there's a buildup of buy and sell orders, and the opening price will reflect that. This is why a security's opening price differs from the last day's closing price.Here's how it typically works:\n\nIn some cases, the opening price may be the most actively traded price of the day, accounting for a large part of the daily volume.\n\nAfter the market closes the day before, corporate announcements and other news can change investor expectations and the next day's opening price.\u00a0Some investors may try to buy or sell securities when large-scale disasters occur after hours.\n\nNot allordersare executed during after-hours trading. There's much lessliquidityduring this time, which produces wider bid-ask spreads. This makes orders less attractive because it's more difficult to find trades at predictable prices, and limit orders often won't be filled.\n\nWhen the market opens the next day, this large number of limit or stop orders\u2014placed at prices different from the previous day's closing price\u2014causes a shift in supply and demand. This causes the opening price to move off the previous day's close toward prices corresponding to the overnight changes.\n\nSavvy traders pay close attention to the opening price, especially when it gaps up or down from the previous close. These gaps can present trading opportunities for short-term and long-term investors.\n\nWhile predicting stock prices has led to financial ruin for many investors, there are some ways togauge a market's opening direction.\n\nThe most obvious is to examine theafter-hoursor premarket activity. Some investors trade shares outside the stock market's regular trading hours, though the volume traded is usually lower. If a stock increases in value after hours and there's no significant news overnight, there's a good chance the stock will have an opening price above the previous day's closing price. The same applies, of course, if it decreases overnight.\n\nPremarket trading happens before the market opens, so the price at which premarket trades occur can also be a helpful way to predict the opening price.\n\nMany investors also review what's happening in international markets to gauge the opening. Trading hours vary from country to country but typically align with regular work hours. For example, in Japan, trading occurs from 9 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. to 3 p.m. local time\u2014i.e., it opens at 7 p.m. and closes at 1 a.m. Eastern time.\n\nWhile many factors influence the prices of stocks across different markets, if another country's markets rose while the American stock market was closed, investor sentiment is often that the American market is likely to open higher than its closing price.\n\nThere are several day-trading strategies based on the opening price. When the opening price is quite different from the previous day\u2019s close, that\u00a0creates a\u00a0price gap. Day traders use a strategy known as the \u201cgap fade and fill.\u201d Traders try to profit from the price correction that usually occurs when there\u2019s a sizable price gap at the opening.\n\nAnother popular strategy is tofadea stock showing strong premarket indications contrary to the rest of the market\u00a0or similar securities. When a disparity is present from premarket signals, a trader waits for the\u00a0stock to move at the open, going against the rest of the market. The trader\u00a0then takes a position in the stock in the market\u2019s general direction when the momentum and volume of the initial contrasting stock price movement\u00a0diminishes.\n\nWhen done correctly, these are high-probability strategies for pocketing quick, small profits.\n\nOn Sept. 19, 2024, the closing price for Apple (AAPL) was 228.87. The next morning, the opening price was $229.97. Later that day, AAPL closed at $228.20.\n\nYes, it's possible to buy a stock at its opening price. If you place amarket-on-openorder to buy a stock before the market opens, you'll buy shares at the opening price.\n\nSome traders follow something called the \"10 a.m. rule.\" The stock market opens for trading at 9:30 a.m., and there's often a lot of trading between 9:30 a.m. and 10 a.m. Traders that follow the 10 a.m. rule think a stock's price trajectory is relatively set for the day by the end of that half-hour.\n\nFor example, if a stock closed at $40 the previous day, opened at $42 the next, and reached $43 by 10 a.m., this would indicate that the stock is likely to remain above $42 by market close.\n\nYes. Traders look for signals from theclosing priceto predict the next day's market direction. A prominent tactic is \"closing price reversion,\" where if a stock's closing price deviates significantly from its historical average, traders try to profit should it revert to the mean.\n\nMeanwhile, closing price breakout strategies involve looking for stocks whose closing prices have broken out of a particular range. For instance, a breakout above a resistance level could indicate a bullish trend.\n\nThe opening price for a stock is the price it trades immediately after the stock market opens at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time. It's often relatively close to the previous day's closing price, though it can shift significantly if there's news overnight.\n\nKnowing the opening price for a stock and how it changes because of overnight trading is crucial information, especially when trading early in the day.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Nasdaq Market Center Systems Description,\" Page 9.\n\nJapan Exchange Group. \"Trading Rules of Domestic Stocks.\"",
