  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAssessed value is the dollar amount assigned to a home or other piece of real estate for property tax purposes. It takes into account the value of comparable properties in the area, among other factors. In many cases, the assessed value is calculated as a percentage of thefair market valueof the property.\n\nThe assessed value of a home or other property is used only to determine the applicable property tax (also known as anad valorem tax).\n\nAssessed value takes into account the overall quality and condition of the property, local property values, square footage, home features, and market conditions. Many of these factors are derived from real estate data for the property's neighborhood and the surrounding area.\n\nA governmentassessoris responsible for assigning a property's assessed value and for updating it periodically.\n\nGovernment assessors are usually designated by specified tax districts. Each district may have a different procedure for calculating assessed value. However, the basic process is largely the same.\n\nDepending on the state and locality, assessors may be required to personally visit properties periodically for assessment purposes. Owners who want to dispute the assessed value placed on their property can request areassessment, which is a second evaluation of the property.\n\nThe assessed value may be lower for a property if you are anowner-occupantas opposed to a landlord (this is sometimes called ahomestead exemption). That doesn\u2019t affect the market value of the property but can reduce your property tax bill.\n\nThe assessed value is considered an accepted dollar value for your home and a reliable indicator of the home's worth.\n\nIn most states and municipalities, assessed value is calculated as a percentage of the property\u2019s fair market value. The percentage rate used can vary considerably from one place to another.\n\nFor example, at 10%, Mississippi uses one of the lowest percentage rates in the nation for owner-occupied, single-family homes to establish assessed value.By contrast, Massachusetts uses a very high percentage rate of 100%.\n\nOnce the assessed value is known, property taxes can then be determined.\n\nThe assessed value of your home is only one factor used to calculate yourproperty taxes. Many tax authorities use an equation such as the following, which typically includes amillage rateor tax rate:\n\nFair Market Value \u00d7 Assessment Rate \u00d7 Millage Rate = Effective Property Tax\n\nThe millage rate is the tax rate applied to the assessed value of the property. Millage rates are typically expressed per $1,000, with one mill representing $1 in tax for every $1,000 of assessed value. So, for calculation purposes, if the mill rate in your jurisdiction is 20, divide that by 1,000 to get .02. Then apply that figure to the calculation.\n\nSay that a house in your area has a fair market value of $300,000. The area's assessment rate is 50% and the mill rate is 20. Using the formula shown above, the property tax would be $3,000:\n\n$300,000 \u00d7 0.50 \u00d7 0.02 = $3,000\n\nIn addition to a real estate tax, many states impose a tax on certain personal property. Similarly, this tax usually is based on the personal property\u2019s assessed value. Types of personal property that are taxed can include mobile homes, cars, motorcycles, and boats. Rates can vary widely as well, depending on where you live.\n\nBoth values are associated with your home, but your local tax authority determines the assessed value used for property taxes. The appraised value meetsmortgage applicationrequirements to verify the home's worth. An industry professional usually handles the appraisal. In addition, homebuyers (or sellers) may seek an appraisal of a property they wish to buy (or sell).\n\nIt's important to know because it plays a role in how your property tax bill is determined. Plus, if you're looking for a home, knowing the assessed value may give you a bargaining chip if the sale price of a home is set much higher.\n\nThat depends on the state or jurisdiction where the property is located. Some areas update assessments annually. Others may do so every few years. Check with the tax department of your town for details.\n\nAssessed value refers to the value assigned to a property, such as a home, by the local government. It is used by the tax authority to determine the property taxes that a homeowner owes. Often, it's calculated as a percentage of the fair market value of the property.\n\nDepartment of Revenue, State of Mississippi. \"Ad Valorem Tax.\"\n\nState of Massachusetts. \"RE18RC07: Property Assessments, Valuation and Taxation.\"",
