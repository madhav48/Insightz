  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA traveler\u2019s check (sometimes spelled \"cheque\") is a once-popular but now largely outmoded medium of exchange utilized as an alternative tohard currencyand intended to aid tourists. The product\u00a0is typically\u00a0used by people on vacation in\u00a0foreign countries. It\u00a0offers a safe way to travel overseas without the risks associated with losing cash. The issuing party, usually a bank, provides security against lost or stolen checks.\n\nTraveler\u2019s checks have increasingly been supplanted by credit cards and prepaid debit cards.\n\nA traveler\u2019s check is for a prepaid fixed amount and operates like cash, so a purchaser can use it to buy goods or services when traveling. A customer can also exchange a traveler\u2019s check for cash. Major financial service institutions issue traveler\u2019s checks, and banks andcredit unionssell them, though their ranks have significantly dwindled today.\n\nA traveler\u2019s check is similar to a regular check because it has a unique check number or serial number. When a customer reports a check stolen or lost, the issuing company cancels that check and provides a new one.\n\nThey come in several fixed denominations in a variety of currencies, making thema safeguard in countries with fluctuating exchange rates, and they do not have an expiration date. They are not linked to a customer\u2019s bank account or line of credit and do not contain personally identifiable information, therefore eliminating the risk of identity theft. They operate via a dual signature system. You sign them when you purchase them, and then you sign them again when you cash them, which is designed to prevent anyone other than the purchaser from using them.\n\nMany\u00a0banks, hotels, and retailers used to accept them as cash, although some banks charged fees to cash them. However, with the rising worldwide use of credit cards and prepaid debit cards\u2014such as theVisa TravelMoneycard, which offers zero liability for its unauthorized use\u2014it is getting much harder to find institutions that will cash traveler\u2019s checks.\n\nJames C. Fargo, the president of the American Express Company, was a wealthy, well-known American who was unable to get checks cashed during a trip to Europe. In 1891, a company employee, Marcellus F. Berry, believed that the solution for taking money overseas required a check with the signature of the bearer and devised a product for it.American Express and Visa still use the British spelling on their products.\n\nCompanies that still issue traveler's checks today includeVisaandAAA. They often come with a purchase fee. AAA now offers members pre-paid international Visa cards instead of paper checks.\n\nIn the U.S., they are available primarily from American Express locations.You can also buy traveler's checks online from the American Express website, but you need to be registered with an account. Visa offers\u00a0traveler's checks\u00a0at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as at several other banks.\n\nAmerican Express, Visa, and AAA are among the companies that still issue traveler\u2019s checks.\n\nIf you want to convert your traveler's checks into cash (instead of spending them directly), you can often deposit them normally at your bank. Many hotel or resort lobbies will also provide this service to guests at no charge. American Express also provides a service to redeem traveler's checks that they issue online to be deposited into your bank account.\n\nTraveler's checks are handy for tourists who do not want to risk losing their cash or having it stolen while abroad. Because traveler's checks can be reported lost or stolen and the funds replaced, they provide peace of mind. This was particularly a concern before credit cards and ATMs were widespread and affordable worldwide for most travelers. At the same time, these paper checks are now a bit outdated and come with a fee to purchase, making them potentially more expensive and cumbersome than using plastic or electronic payments.\n\nWidely accepted around the world\n\nMust have the physical check to use it\n\nLimited number of issuers today\n\nThe most obvious alternative is to use a credit or debit card issued by a bank that works worldwide and charges low or no foreign exchange fees on purchases or ATM withdrawals. If your bank doesn't allow for this or charges high fees, then prepaid travel cards are the modern version of traveler\u2019s checks. They allow you to get local currency from ATMs and make purchases with merchants\u2014effectively eliminating the need for traveler\u2019s checks.\n\nPrepaid cards are not linked to your bank account, which prevents anybody from draining your checking account if the card gets lost or stolen\u2014and you can\u2019t go into debt. Credit cards offer similar (or better) protection, but you might not want to use your everyday card abroad. By using a dedicated travel card, you avoid spreading your card numbers around, which means you can be less vigilant about monitoring your accounts when you get back home. Visa and MasterCard both offer prepaid cards designed for use abroad. Those cards are available online, through travel agents, and at banks or credit unions.\n\nTravel cards should feature low ATM fees, technology that lets you operate like a local in foreign countries, emergency cash when you lose the card, and \u201czero liability\u201d fraud protection. That said, prepaid cards can be expensive, so you need to compare fees against your other cards to decide whether or not a travel card makes sense.\n\nFor U.S. citizens living abroad for extended periods, maintaining checking and other bank accounts in the United States provides several advantages, and many checking accounts arefriendly for foreign transactions.\n\nYou can buy still buy traveler's checks from Visa and a handful of other financial institutions. To buy them, visit a location or check the website of an issuing institution. You may need a photo ID in order to set up an account.\n\nSome hotels, resorts, and currency traders will cash traveler's checks in exchange for local currency. However, with the rising prevalence of credit and debit cards fewer locations cash traveler's checks.\n\nTraveler's checks are a secure way of carrying money while abroad. Many businesses in the tourism industry will cash traveler's checks, and they can also be deposited into a bank account. Because the checks can be easily replaced, they have a lower risk of theft or loss. However, traveler's checks have fallen out of favor due to the increased convenience of credit cards and prepaid debit cards.\n\nTraveler's checks were once a popular way to carry money while vacationing abroad. They are sold in fixed denominations, and can be used for purchases or cashed like an ordinary check. Traveler's checks can be easily replaced, making them less risky than carrying large amounts of cash. However, they have fallen out of favor due to the convenience of using credit or debit cards.\n\nSparks, Evan. \u201cNine Young Bankers Who Changed America: Marcellus Flemming Berry.\u201d ABA Banking Journal, June 26, 2017.\n\nTime Magazine. \"Travel (April, 1956): The Host with the Most.\"\n\nAmerican Express. \"Travelers Cheques.\"",
