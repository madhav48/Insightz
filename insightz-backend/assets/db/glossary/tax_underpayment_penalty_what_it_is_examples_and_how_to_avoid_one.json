Taxpayers must generally pay at least 90% of their taxes due during the previous year to avoid an underpayment penalty. The fine can grow with the size of the shortfall.\n\nTaxpayers can consult IRS instructions for Form 2210 to determine whether they're required to report an underpayment and pay a penalty.\n\nThe tax law requires that taxpayers make payments as they receive income throughout the year.\n\nFor employees, estimated taxes are withheld from paychecks based on information the employee provides in aW-4 form.\n\nSelf-employed people and business owners are required tofile quarterlytax returns and pay estimated taxes due for the period. Others who must file quarterly include people with investment income and landlords.\n\nThe best way to avoid an underpayment penalty is to ensure that your taxes are fully paid on time.\n\nTo avoid an underpayment penalty, individuals whoseadjusted gross income(AGI) is $150,000 or less must pay the lesser of 90% of the current year\u2019s tax or 100% of last year\u2019s tax by combining estimated and withholding taxes.\n\nIndividuals whose AGI for the preceding taxable year exceeds $150,000 must pay the lesser of 90% of the tax due for the current year or 110% of the tax on the individual\u2019s return for the prior taxable year.\n\nThe underpayment penalty is owed when a taxpayer underpays the estimated taxes or makes uneven payments during thetax yearthat do not correspond to the taxpayer\u2019s current income for a period.\n\nA penalty will not be imposed if:\n\nThe underpayment penalty may also be waived for several other reasons, including:\n\nTaxpayers with self-employment income need to take into account their liability for Social Security and Medicare taxes whencalculating the amounts due.\n\nSome taxpayers, such as sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, must pay taxes in four equal payments during the year, although they can do so more frequently. Taxpayers who receive their income unevenly may be able to pay different amounts quarterly in some cases.\n\nTaxpayers can use IRS Form 2210 to determine if their payments of withholding and estimated taxes during the year are sufficient to avoid a penalty.\n\nTaxpayers must pay the difference plus a penalty that is calculated based on the outstanding amount owed and how long the amount has been overdue.\n\nThe penalty isn't a static percentage or a flat dollar amount. It\u2019s based on several factors, including the total underpayment amount\u00a0and the period during which taxes were underpaid. Underpayments are subject to the failure-to-pay penalty, which is 0.5% of the amount owed for each month and the part of a month for which the tax is not paid.\n\nThe underpayment failure-to-pay penalty is capped at 25% of the unpaid amount.\n\nTax underpayments and overpayments accrue interest as well. The IRS determines the interest rate every quarter, generally basing it on thefederal short-term rateplus three percentage points for most taxpayers.\n\nThe rates were 8% for individual underpayments and 7% for large corporate underpayments for the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2023 and the first quarter (Q1) of 2024.\n\nIf you owed $5,000 in taxes for the year but only paid $2,000, you would have underpaid your taxes by $3,000.\n\nYou paid less than 90% of what you owed so you would be subject to an underpayment penalty. The penalty would be the federal short-term rate at the time plus three percentage points. That would add up to about 8%, or $240, as of mid-2024.\n\nYou may qualify for a reduced underpayment penalty even if you don't qualify for the exceptions to the underpayment penalty. For example, an individual who changes their tax filing status from single to married filing jointly may get a reduced penalty due to the larger standard deduction.\n\nA reduction might also be extended to taxpayers who generate\u00a0significant portions of their income late in the calendar year. For example, if a taxpayer sold an investment in December, triggering a substantialcapital gains tax, the penalty might not be applied.\n\nSometimes, the IRS might make an error in assessing interest or a penalty against a taxpayer. Taxpayers can fileForm 843to request the correction of the error.\n\nThe IRS underpayment penalty was 7% for most underpayments and 9% for large corporate underpayments through the first three quarters of 2023.It increased to 8% in the fourth quarter.\n\nIRS safe harbor rules allow you to avoid a penalty or pay a reduced penalty if you meet certain conditions. An underpayment penalty with the IRS can be avoided if you owe less than $1,000 or pay more than 90% of your tax obligation for the year.\n\nSome taxpayers, such as sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, must pay taxes at least quarterly if they will owe more than $1,000. These payments are referred to as estimated tax payments.\n\nYou cannot pay estimated tax payments all at once unless you do so at the beginning of the year. You can pay monthly in advance if that suits your budget better.\n\nYou could end up paying an underpayment penalty if you don't pay enough in estimated taxes, tax withholding, or taxes due. Check to see if you qualify for an exemption or reduced penalty if you're charged a penalty.\n\nThe best way to avoid underpayment penalties is to be sure that you pay your taxes on time, meaning around the time you earn it, not the following April.\n\nIf all or nearly all of your income is from an employer, you shouldn't have an underpayment problem. If you do, check the details on your W-4 form for errors that caused your employer to withhold less than necessary from your paycheck.\n\nIRS. \u201cUnderpayment of Estimated Tax by Individuals Penalty.\u201d\n\nIRS. \"20.1.3 Estimated Tax Penalties.\"\n\nIRS. \u201cTopic No. 306, Penalty for Underpayment of Estimated Tax.\u201d\n\nIRS. \"Interest Rates Increase for the Fourth Quarter 2023.\"\n\nIRS. \"Interest Rates Remain the Same for the First Quarter of 2024.\"\n\nIRS. \"2023 Instructions for Form 2210.\" Page 8.\n\nIRS. \"Interest Rates Remain the Same for the Third Quarter of 2023.\"\n\nIRS. \"Interest Rates Increase for First Quarter of 2023.\"\n\nIRS. \u201cBasics of Estimated Taxes for Individuals.\u201d",
