  "term": "Nonce: What It Means and How It\u2019s Used in Blockchain",
  "definition": "Nonce, a portmanteau of \u201cnumber used only once,\u201d is a number that the Bitcoin mining program uses. It is included in the block header, then that information is hashed. If the resulting hexadecimal number adds up to a value of less than or equal to the network\u2019s difficulty target, the miner\u2019s block is added to the blockchain. Another is opened, and the process begins again.\n\nA Bitcoin nonce is a 32-bit (or 4-byte) number that miners use to attempt to generate a valid hash to produce a new block in the Bitcoinblockchain. The nonce is one of the fields included in the block header, which also includes:\n\nOn the Bitcoin network, participants called miners compete to generate a hash that is less than or equal to the network target hash by repeatedly changing the nonce after each unsuccessful attempt.\n\nHashing refers to the process of applying acryptographic hash functionto information. The cryptographic hash function is a mathematical operation that takes block data and encrypts it by transforming it into a unique value, a fixed-length output of hexadecimal characters.\n\nThis hash value serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the block, ensuring that the block\u2019s contents remain unaltered. The nonce is the only variable in the block header that a miner can modify. By changing the nonce, a miner can change the hash of the block and calculate different possible solutions.\n\nFor example, this is the previous paragraph sent through an SHA-256 hashing algorithm:\n\nacd691b23cc47b03addf7329b0467c6190e758ee763d7d648af75b5c5ae73e3a\n\nBy adding a value of zero (the nonce) at the end of the paragraph, you get a different hexadecimal value:\n\nIf you change that zero to a one, you\u2019d get this:\n\nThis is how the nonce is used by the Bitcoin mining programming. The nonce value is increased by one with every attempt until a certain value is reached.\n\nThe first miner to find a valid hash under the network\u2019s difficulty target is awarded the block reward. Their block is broadcast to the network, added to the blockchain, and the process begins again.\n\nThe target difficulty is a measure of how difficult it is to find a valid nonce. It is adjusted periodically to maintain a consistent block generation rate.\n\nYou\u2019ll find in a block explorer that nonces generally only go up into the billions. For example, the nonce for block 841,948 was 1,614,498,317. Block 841,949 had a nonce of 4,218,083,700. A modern mining rig can generate many more hashes than this in less than one second.\n\nAdditionally, the nonce is limited to 32 bits (4 bytes), so it can only go up to a little more than 4.29 billion. It has to roll over to be useful because hashing is so fast. So, an additional method was created after Bitcoin ASIC miners began ripping through the blockchain. Another number, called the extra nonce, is randomly generated and used in the coinbase data field. This value is added to the coinbase transaction space, which changes the Merkle root.\n\nThe Merkle root is part of the block header, so the block header hash changes. The extra nonce and the nonce are both manipulated to try to find the solution. If a solution cannot be found using either of these, the mining program allows the miners to adjust the timestamp. The combination of these three values allows the blockchain to keep its target of mining one block about every 10 minutes.\n\n\u201cNonce\u201d combines the phrase \u201cnumber used once.\u201dIt is used by the Bitcoin blockchainto help generate a hashed value when mining a block.\n\nA nonce, in blockchain terms, is a number used once. Regarding its use on a blockchain, it is a number that increases sequentially in every attempt to generate a hash that meets the network\u2019s difficulty criteria.\n\nThe best example of a nonce is a nonce used to mine a block. The nonce used in block 841,954 was 3,983,795,221.This doesn\u2019t mean it only took the miner 3.98 trillion attempts\u2014it likely rolled over several thousand times and was used in combination with the variable extra nonce and timestamp entries. As a 32-bit number, the nonce can only increase to slightly more than 4.29 billion.\n\nInBitcoinmining, miners compete to find a nonce that meets the network\u2019s difficulty criteria. The information in a block header is sent through a hashing algorithm, resulting in a value that must be less than or equal to the network difficulty target.\n\nIn every attempt to meet the target, the nonce is increased by one. If it exceeds the 32-bit limit, it is rolled over, and the extra nonce and timestamp are used in combination with it until a miner is successful.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
