  "definition": "The term tax-advantaged refers to any type of investment, financial account, or savings plan that is either exempt from taxation, tax-deferred, or that offers other types of tax benefits. Examples of tax-advantaged investments are municipal bonds, partnerships, UITs, and annuities. Tax-advantaged plans include IRAs and qualified retirement plans such as 401(k)s.\n\nTax-advantaged investments and accounts are used by a wide variety of investors and employees in various financial situations. High-income taxpayers seek tax-free municipal-bond income, while employees save for retirement with IRAs andemployer-sponsored retirement plans.\n\nThe two common methods that allow people to minimize their tax bills aretax-deferredandtax-exemptstatus. The key to deciding which, or if a combination of both, makes sense for you comes down to when the tax advantages are realized.\n\nTax-deferred accounts allow you to realize immediatetax deductionson the full amount of your contribution, but future withdrawals from the account will be taxed at yourordinary-incomerate.The most common tax-deferred retirement accounts in the U.S. aretraditional IRAsand401(k) plans. In Canada, the most common is aRegistered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).\n\nEssentially, as the name of the account implies, taxes on income are deferred to a later date.\n\nFor example, if yourtaxable incomethis year is $50,000 and you contributed $3,000 to a tax-deferred account, you would pay tax on only $47,000. In 30 years, once you retire, if your taxable income is initially $40,000, but you decide to withdraw $4,000 from the account, taxable income would be bumped up to $44,000.\n\nThe SECURE Actmade alterations to many of the rules related to tax-advantaged retirement plans and savings vehicles, like traditional IRAs and 529 accounts.\n\nTax-exempt accounts, on the other hand, provide future tax benefits because withdrawals at retirement are not subject to taxes. Since contributions to the account are made with after-tax dollars, there is no immediate tax advantage.\n\nThe primary advantage of this type of structure is that investment returns grow tax-free. Popular tax-exempt accounts in the U.S. are theRoth IRAandRoth 401(k). In Canada, the most common is aTax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).\n\nIf you contributed $1,000 into a tax-exempt account today and the funds were invested in amutual fund, which provided a yearly 3% return, in 30 years the account would be valued at $2,427. By contrast, in a regular taxable investment portfolio where one would paycapital gains taxeson $1,427, if this investment were made through a tax-exempt account, growth would not be taxed.\n\nWith a tax-deferred account, taxes are paid in the future but with a tax-exempt account, taxes are paid right now. However, by shifting the period when you pay taxes and realizing tax-free investment growth, major advantages can be realized.\n\nInvestopedia'sTax Savings Guidecan help you maximize your tax credits, deductions, and savings.

To incentivize more investors to purchase these bonds, the interest income received by investors is not taxed at the federal level. In many cases, if the bondholder resides in the same state where the bonds were issued, their interest income will also be exempt from state and local taxes.\n\nDepreciationalso yields tax advantages for individuals and businesses that invest in real estate. Depreciation is an income tax deduction that allows a taxpayer to recover thecost basisof certain property. In the U.S., the cost of acquiring a land or building iscapitalizedover a specified number of useful years by annual depreciation deductions.\n\nFor example, assume an investor purchases a property for $5 million (the cost basis). After five years, the investor has depreciation deductions of $500,000 and their new cost basis is $4.5 million. If they sell the property for $5.75 million, the investor's realized gain will be $5.75 million - $4.5 million = $1.25 million. The $500,000 deduction will be taxed at thedepreciation recapture rateand the remaining $750,000 will be taxed as acapital gain.\n\nWithout the tax advantage of the depreciation allowance, the entire gain realized from the sale of the property will be taxed as a capital gain.\n\nWith regularbrokerage accounts, the IRS taxes investors on any capital gains realized from selling profitable investments. However, tax-advantaged accounts allow an individual\u2019s investing activities to be tax-deferred and, in some cases, tax-free. Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are examples of tax-deferred accounts in which earnings on investments are not taxed every year.\n\nInstead, tax is deferred until the individual retires, at which point they can start making withdrawals from the account. Withdrawing from these accounts without penalty is allowed once the account holder turns 59\u00bd years old.\n\nPrior to the passage of theSetting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, which was signed into law on December 20, 2019, once an account holder turned 70\u00bd years, they were obligated to begin takingrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)from their tax-deferred retirement accounts. Under SECURE, individuals have until age 72 before the required minimum distributions kick in. In addition, the age limit for contributing to a traditional IRA was removed, allowing working account holders to invest indefinitely, similar to a Roth IRA.\n\nThe threshold to begin receiving distributions was changed once again when Congress approved and passed the SECURE Act 2.0 in December 2022. Individuals must begin taking RMDs when they turn 73 on or after Jan. 1, 2023.\n\nTraditional IRAs are tax-deferred investment vehicles, whereas Roth IRAs are tax-exempt. In the case of traditional IRAs, the amount you contribute gives an immediate tax advantage, as you can deduct this amount from your taxable income. While Roth IRAs provide no immediate tax advantage\u2013you can not deduct contributions from your taxable income\u2013the gains they accrue are tax-free upon withdrawal.\n\nIndividuals of any age can contribute to a Roth IRA. Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs do not have mandatory RMDs. However, Roth IRAs do have afive-year-rule, which requires individuals to wait five years following their first contribution to a Roth IRA to make their first earnings withdrawal. This limitation may be a factor to consider when deciding whether to contribute to a Roth IRA.\n\nWhether you should contribute to aRoth IRA or a traditional IRAfirst depends on your future income expectations. If you expect your income to be lower at retirement than at the current moment, then you should focus your contributions toward traditional IRAs, which provide immediate tax advantages. However, if you expect your income, and thus tax rate, to be higher in the future, then consider contributing to Roth IRAs first, as future withdrawals from these accounts will be tax-free.\n\nRoth IRAs and FSAs offer even more tax savings for investors than tax-deferred accounts, as activities in these accounts are exempt from tax. Withdrawals and earnings in these accounts are tax-free, providing a perfect example of a tax advantage.\n\nGovernments establish tax advantages to encourage private individuals to contribute money when it is considered to be in the public interest. Selecting the proper type of tax-advantaged accounts or investments depends on an investor's financial situation.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"What Does It Mean to Be Pre-Tax or Tax-Advantaged?\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"The SECURE Act and the Retirement Enhancement and Savings Act Tax Proposals (H.R. 1994 and S. 972).\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Municipal Bonds.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 704 Depreciation.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets,\" Pages 26-27.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - Exceptions to Tax on Early Distributions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plans and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"H.R.2617 - Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023.\" Division T: Section 107.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Retirement Accounts.\"\n\nHealth Insurance Marketplace. \"Glossary: Flexible Spending Account (FSA).\"",
