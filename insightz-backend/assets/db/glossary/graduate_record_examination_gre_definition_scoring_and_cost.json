  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe graduate record examination (GRE) is a standardized exam used to measure one's aptitude for abstract thinking in the areas of analytical writing, mathematics, and vocabulary. The GRE is commonly used by manygraduate schoolsin the U.S. and Canada to determine an applicant's eligibility for the program.\n\nThe GRE today is primarily offered via computer; however, in areas that lack the appropriate computer networks, a paper-based exam may be given.\n\nThe GRE consists of three key sections designed to measure verbal,quantitativereasoning, and analytical writing skills.\n\nThe verbal reasoning section analyzes the test taker's ability to draw conclusions, distinguish major and relevant points, and understand words and sentences, among other things. It\u2019s structured to measure the test taker\u2019s ability to analyze and evaluate written material.\n\nThis section also gauges their capacity to process the information they gather from written material and see and analyze relationships between different parts of sentences.\n\nIn the quantitative segment, the test taker\u2019s ability to solve problems is measured through the use of concepts of geometry,data analysis, and algebra. Test takers must solve problems using mathematical problems, and interpret and analyze quantitative data.\n\nThe final section, meanwhile, measures the test taker\u2019s capacity for critical thinking and analytical writing\u2014in particular, how well they can articulate complex ideas and provide effective support for those concepts.\n\nThe GRE was introduced in 1936 by a consortium of four universities and the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. In 1938, the University of Wisconsin became the first public university to ask students to take the GRE.\n\nThe Educational Testing Service (ETS) was created in 1947 and currently oversees GRE testing. Initially, the GRE test included only verbal and quantitative sections. An analytics and logic section was later added but then replaced, after 2002, with the analytical writing assessment.\n\nNew questions were introduced in 2007, together with fill-in-the-blank style questions in the math section, while 2008 brought style changes to the reading comprehension questions.\n\nThe biggest changes came in 2011, with a new design that includes the current 130 to 170 scoring scale, doing away with particular question types, and making the computer adaptive testing adjustments based on sections and not questions.\n\nDespite its ubiquity, some universities have begun dropping GRE requirements, amidst criticism that the exam is unfair and biased, and moreover does not provide a good prediction ofgraduate studentsuccess or further employment in academia.\n\nIn 2023, the ETS announced a shortening of the GRE. Instead of a 4-hour long exam, test-takers will receive a condensed exam that will take less than two hours to complete, about half the time of the current test.\u00a0The shorter test removes and condenses some of the sections on the GRE such as the argument essay, and experimental (unscored) section, and alters the number of questions in the quantitative and verbal sections.\n\nThere are three different sections of the GRE; these are scored in two different ways:\n\nYour final GRE score is the combination of your Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning scores. These scores are reported on a scale of 260 to 340, in one-point increments. The Analytical Writing score is reported separately.\n\nThe GRE General Test is used broadly by graduate andbusiness schoolsto screen applicants. Some schools may require applicants to take GRE Subject Tests, which measure knowledge in particular fields of study. As of 2024, only three subjects are offered: physics, psychology, and mathematics.\n\nThe subjects offered for subject tests have frequently changed over time. Many previously offered tests have been discontinued such as chemistry, English literature, and biology.\n\nMost business schools prefer that applicants attempt theGMATbefore applying for anMBAprogram, although many of them will also accept GRE scores as an equivalent.\n\nThe GRE features a writing section and the GMAT does not. However, the GMAT math section is considered more difficult. Nevertheless, many business schools, including the top business schools in the U.S., accept the GRE as an entrance exam for their MBA programs.\n\nTo get a better idea of typical scores for the GRE, here are the average GRE scores for students entering in 2023.\n\nThe GRE can be taken at testing centers or at home. The test takes one hour and 58 minutes to complete. There are five sections: writing and two sections each for the verbal and quantitative parts.\n\nWhile there is no limit on the number of times one can take the exam, there must be a 21-day gap between any two consecutive test attempts. The exam also cannot be taken more than five times in a calendar year.\n\nA test taker might take the exam multiple times in order to improve their test scores and increase their chances of being accepted into the graduate schools they are interested in attending. Test takers choose which scores they send to graduate schools, unlike other standardized tests that are reported without input from the applicant.\n\nThe cost of the exam in the U.S. is $220. That same fee applies to most other countries in the world with two exceptions. In China, the exam costs $231.30 and in India, the exam costs 22,550 Indian rupees.\n\nIndividuals can sign up to take the GRE on the ETS website. Taking the computer test requires a free ETS account, then the test taker can sign up for a test date and center\u2014although they must register at least two calendar days prior to the planned test date. At-home testing is also an option. Payment for the test can be made via credit or debit card,PayPal, or AliPay+.\n\nIn terms of preparing for the GRE, the ETS website offers a range of resources, most of which are free. The ETS offers free practice tests, math skills reviews with definitions and examples, and instructional videos.\n\nThe ETS also offers paid materials, which include additional practice tests. Section-specific questions, such as verbal reasoning, can be purchased, too. In addition, there are online writing practice features available through the service, which allow you to write two essays and get scores and feedback.\n\nThe total testing time for the GRE is 1 hour and 58 minutes. The writing section is 30 minutes. The verbal reasoning portion has two parts lasting 18 and 23 minutes. Lastly, the quantitative reasoning portion has two parts lasting 21 and 26 minutes.\n\nYes, you can retake the GRE. There is no strict limit on how many times you can take the test, but there is a waiting period of 21 days between attempts. You can take the GRE up to five times within any continuous rolling 12-month period.\n\nYes, you have the option to send only your best GRE scores to schools. The ScoreSelect option allows you to choose which scores are sent to institutions, giving you control over which scores they see.\n\nNo, not all schools require GRE scores for admission. More and more schools have been dropping the requirement.\n\nThe GRE is a standardized test used for admissions into graduate and business school programs. It assesses a student's readiness for advanced academic studies by evaluating their verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, and analytical writing skills.\n\nThe test consists of three main sections: Verbal Reasoning, Quantitative Reasoning, and Analytical Writing. GRE scores range from 130 to 170 for each of the Verbal and Quantitative sections, and from 0 to 6 for Analytical Writing.\n\nStudentProgress. \"History of GRE Test: When, Why and Who Created the GRE Exam.\"\n\nDuke University. \"Change in Structure of GRE Test.\"\n\nPeterson's. \"GRE Test Changes - Important Info.\"\n\nETS. \"Shorter GRE Test Coming September 2023.\"\n\nETS. \"GRE\u00ae General Test Interpretive Data.\" Page 2.\n\nKaplan. \"What's a Good GRE Score?\"\n\nPoets & Quants. \"GRE Scores & Submission Rates at the Top 50 U.S. MBA Programs.\"\n\nETS. \"GRE General Test Registration.\"\n\nGRE India. \"The GRE General Test.\"\n\nETS. \"Fees for GRE\u00ae Tests and Related Services.\"\n\nETS. \"GRE General Test Structure.\"\n\nETS. \"Schedule Your GRE General Test.\"",
