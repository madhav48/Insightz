  "definition": "A bull market is a period in which financial market prices are climbing or are anticipated to go up.\n\nIn the financial markets, such as stocks, when prices have generally been increasing or are expected to increase, a bull market exists. Bull markets commonly refer to the stock market but can be applied to anything that is traded, such as bonds, real estate, currencies, and commodities. Bull markets may be evident during periods of economic growth when GDP rises and unemployment falls, and can exist over extended periods where equity prices rise over months or years.\n\nBull markets generally start when the economy is strong.
