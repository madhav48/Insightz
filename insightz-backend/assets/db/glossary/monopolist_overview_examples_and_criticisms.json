  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA monopolist is an individual, group, or company that controls all of the market for a particular good or service.\u00a0A monopolist probably also believes in policies that favormonopoliessince it gives them greater power. A monopolist has little incentive to improve their product because customers have no alternatives. Instead, their motivation is focused on protecting the monopoly.\n\nMonopolies\u00a0exist when a monopolist becomes the\u00a0only supplier of a particular product or service. This is different from amonopsony, which\u00a0refers\u00a0to a single entity's sole power\u00a0to purchase a good or service. It is also different from anoligopoly,\u00a0which consists of a few sellers dominating a market.\n\nThehallmark of a monopolyis\u00a0a lack of economic\u00a0competition\u00a0to produce the\u00a0good\u00a0or\u00a0service, a lack of viable\u00a0substitute goods, and the possibility of a high\u00a0monopoly price\u00a0well above the seller's\u00a0marginal cost\u00a0that leads to excessive\u00a0profit.\n\nIn economics, a monopoly is a single seller. However, according to the\u00a0law, a monopoly only needs to be a\u00a0business entity that hassignificant market power\u2014enough power to charge overly high prices.Although monopolies may be big businesses, size is not a required characteristic of a monopoly.\n\nA small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry.\u00a0Monopolies can be established by a government, form organically,\u00a0or form by the merger of formerly independent companies or organizations.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, such as the United States, there are laws restricting\u00a0monopolies. Being the sole or dominant player in a market is often not illegal in itself.\u00a0However,\u00a0certain categories of monopolistic behavior can be considered abusive in afree market,\u00a0and such activities will\u00a0often attract the monopoly label and\u00a0legal sanctions to go with it.\n\nWhen a company is the sole provider of a good or service, it can become powerful enough to prevent other companies from entering the marketplace and providing competition. With the lack of alternative choices in the marketplace, consumers are often left with no choice but to pay the higher prices the monopolist demands or go without the desired product or service.\n\nGovernments enact and enforceantitrust lawsto penalize monopolists and ensure fair competition in the marketplace.These laws protect consumers from predatory business practices, such as price gouging. In some cases, the government may step in and force a breakup of the monopoly.\n\nAgovernment-granted monopoly\u00a0or\u00a0legal monopoly, by contrast, is sanctioned by the state, often to provide an incentive to invest in a risky venture or enrich a domestic\u00a0interest group.\u00a0Patents,\u00a0copyrights, and\u00a0trademarks\u00a0are sometimes used as examples of government-granted monopolies. In the United States, many companies in theutilities sectorare an example of government-granted monopolies. A\u00a0government may also reserve a\u00a0venture for itself and form a government monopoly.\n\nA monopolist has full control of a market and is the one supplier that provides a good or service to many consumers. Beyond that, however, there are certaincharacteristics of a monopolistthat stand out above others:\n\nThe United States Department of Justice. \"Antitrust Laws and You.\"\n\nThe United States Department of Justice. \"Competition and Monopoly: Single-firm Conduct Under Section 2 of the Sherman Act: Chapter 2.\"",
