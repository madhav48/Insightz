  "term": "Back Stop: Definition, How It Works in Offering, and Example",
  "definition": "In corporate finance and investment banking, a back stop (or backstop) is to provide last-resort support or to make a bid in a securitiesofferingfor theunsubscribedportion of shares.\n\nWhen a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance\u2014and wants to guarantee the amount received through the issue\u2014it may get a back stop from an underwriter or a major shareholder, such as aninvestment bank, to buy any of its unsubscribed shares.\n\nA back stop functions as a form of insurance. While not an actual insurance plan, a company can guarantee that a certain amount of its offering will be purchased by particular organizations, usually investment banking firms, if the open market does not produce enough investors and a portion of the offering goes unsold.\n\nIf the organization providing the back stop is an investment banking firm, sub-underwriters representing the investment firm will enter into an agreement with the company. This agreement is referred to as a firm-commitment underwriting deal or contract, and it provides overall support for the offering by committing to purchase a specific number of unsold shares.\n\nBy entering into a firm-commitment underwriting agreement, the associated organization has claimed full responsibility for the quantity of shares specified if they initially go unsold, and promises to provide the associated capital in exchange for the available shares.\n\nThis gives assurance to the issuer that the minimum capital can be raised regardless of the open market activity. Additionally, all risk associated with the specified shares is effectively transferred to the underwritten organization.\n\nIf all of the offering is purchased through regular investment vehicles, the contract obligating the organization to purchase any unsold shares is rendered void, as the conditions surrounding the promise to purchase no longer exist.\n\nThe contracts between an issuer and the underwriting organization can take various forms. For example, the underwriting organization can provide the issuer with a revolving credit loan to boost credit ratings for the issuer. They may also issue letters of credit as guarantees to the entity raising capital through offerings.\n\nIf the underwriting organization takes possession of any shares, as specified in the agreement, the shares belong to the organization to manage as it sees fit. The shares are treated the same way as any other investment purchased through normal market activity. The issuing company can impose no restrictions on how the shares are traded.\n\nThe underwriting organization may subsequently hold or sell the associated securities per the regulations that govern the activity overall.\n\nIn arights offering, you may see a statement to this effect: \"ABC Company will provide a 100 percent back stop of up to $100 million for any unsubscribed portion of the XYZ Company rights offering.\" If XYZ is trying to raise $200 million, but only raises $100 million through investors, then ABC Company purchases the remainder.\n\nSimilar to the back stop in an equity placement, a back stop for a bond issue is a type of guarantee whereby the underwriting bank or syndicate will fix a price at which to purchase any unsold or unsubscribed bonds.\n\nIf the underwriting bank or investment banking syndicate cannot or do not want to back stop a new issue, third-partybackstop purchasersmay be called upon to step in and buy any unsubscribed portion of a securities issue. These purchasers may provide a bid substantially below the issue price and/or may demand fees as compensation. They would then often try to sell off the holdings over time at a profit.\n\nTheVolcker Ruleis a set of financial regulations that separates the commercial and investment banking activities of a firm.Its purposeis to prevent conflicts of interest and unfair practices to the detriment of a bank's customers. One provision of the Rule is to prevent the backstopping of a securities issue by an underwriting bank if it will create a conflict of interest. Moreover, a back stop would be prohibited if it would \"result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.\"\n\nCornell Law School Legal Information Institute. \"17 CFR \u00a7 255.7 - Limitations on Permitted Proprietary Trading Activities.\"",
