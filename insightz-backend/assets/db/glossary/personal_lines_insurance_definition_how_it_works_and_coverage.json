  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nPersonal lines insurance refers to any kind ofinsurancethat covers individuals against loss that results from death, injury, or loss of property. These insurance lines generally protect people and their families from losses they couldn\u2019t afford to cover on their own.\u00a0Personal lines\u00a0insurance makes\u00a0it possible to do things such as driving a car and owning a home without risking financial ruin. This is not the same ascommercial lines insurance, which provides property and casualty coverage for businesses.\n\nPersonal lines insurance is any type ofinsurance coveragepurchased by an individual to cover themselves and/or their families. These policies protect against different kinds of personal risks that would lead to potentially crushing financial losses caused by fire, theft,natural disasters, death, accidents, lawsuits, and illness.\n\nThe amount of insurance coverage\u00a0you can get\u00a0generally depends on how much you are willing to pay inpremiums. The more you are willing to pay, the more insurance you\u00a0can obtain. Individuals can usually tailor each policy\u2019s coverage anddeductiblesto strike the right balance between the amount of coverage and the cost of premiums.\u00a0Premiums can also vary according to where you live.\n\nPersonal lines insurance won\u2019t cover every risk an individual might face. However, it can dramatically reduce the policyholder'sliabilityfor damages\u00a0and the dollar amount they might have to pay out of pocket to remedy an unfortunate situation.\n\nPersonal lines insurance includes products such ashomeowners insurance, flood insurance, earthquake insurance, renters insurance, automobile insurance, life insurance,disability insurance, umbrella insurance, and health insurance. Some types of personal insurance, such asautomobile liability insurance,\u00a0are often required by law.\n\nFor instance, required minimum levels of automobile liability insurance\u00a0are common and can vary by\u00a0jurisdiction or state.\u00a0Other\u00a0types of personal lines insurance, such as comprehensive and collision automobile insurance and homeowners insurance, may be required by lenders when a property is\u00a0used ascollateralfor a loan.\n\nIndividuals may be unable to purchase a policy for a particular situation\u00a0because\u00a0they pose too great a risk to the insurance company. For example, someone with a history of cancer may not be able to purchaselife insurance. Another example would be a homeowner who wants to buyflood insurance, but whose\u00a0house\u00a0is below the flood plain.\n\nIn some\u00a0cases, high-risk individuals can still purchase insurance, but they will have to pay above-average premiums to compensate the insurer for the extra risk. One common example of this\u00a0is high-risk auto insurance for drivers\u00a0who've received multiple moving traffic violations over a short time or\u00a0who've\u00a0been at fault in multiple accidents over a short period of time.\n\nThe average annual full-coverage insurance cost for medium sedans in 2020.\n\nPersonal lines insurance accounts for about 53% ofnet premiums writtenin the property and casualty insurance market, while commercial lines insurance accounts for about 47%.While personal lines insurance covers individuals, commercial lines insurance provides coverage to businesses and other enterprises.\n\nCommercial lines insurance helps protect businesses from any losses they may not be able to cover on their own. This kind of insurance not only covers large commercial enterprises but also protects small businesses against risk. Commercial property insurance, commercial auto insurance, casualty insurance, and medicalmalpractice insuranceare all kinds of commercial lines insurance.\n\nIt isn't always easy to determine how much coverage a business may require under a commercial policy. That's because the needs ofcorporations\u2014even small businesses\u2014are much more complicated and complex than individuals who seek coverage.\n\nFor instance, businesses are dependent on their employees, whose actions may put the business at risk for lawsuits or damages should an accident occur. Consider drivers who use company vehicles. The liability for a company may increase because of an employee's driving habits and behaviors while on the road.\n\nAAA. \"Your Driving Costs, 2020,\" Page 5.
