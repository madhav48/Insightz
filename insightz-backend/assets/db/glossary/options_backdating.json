  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nOptions backdating is the process of granting anemployee stock option(ESO) that is dated before its actual issuance. In this way, theexercise (strike) priceof the granted option can be set at a lower price than that of the company's stock price at the granting date. This process makes the granted option \"in the money\" (ITM) and therefore of greater value to the holder.\n\nThe practice of backdating options has been considered unethical and is now the subject of regulatory scrutiny, making it far less widespread in recent years.\n\nThe practice of options backdating first occurred when companies were only required to report the issuance ofstock optionsto the SEC within two months of the initial grant date. Companies would simply wait during that period to identify a particular date in which the company's stock price fell to a low and then moved higher within those two months. The company would then grant the option, but date it at or near this lowest point. This back-date would become the offcial granted option that would be reported to the SEC.\n\nThe act of optionsbackdatingbecame much more difficult after companies were required to report the granting of options to the SEC within two business days. This adjustment to the filing window came with the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation in 2002.\n\nAfter the two-day reporting rule went into effect, the SEC found numerous companies were still backdating options in violation of the legislation. Disordered, untimely paperwork was cited as the cause in some cases of unintentional backdating. Initially, lax enforcement of the reporting rule was also blamed for allowing many companies to sidestep the rule adjustment that stemmed fromSarbanes-Oxley.\n\nTheSECwould go on to investigate and sue companies and related parties that were found to backdate options, in some cases, as part of fraudulent and deceptive schemes. For example, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit in 2010 against Trident Microsystems and two former senior executives from the company for stock option backdating violations. The legal complaint alleged that from 1993 to 2006, the former CEO and the former chief accounting officer directed the company to engage in schemes to provide undisclosed compensation to executives and certain employees.\n\nCEO Frank C. Lin was accused of backdating stock option documents to give the appearance that options were granted on earlier dates than issued. This\u00a0scheme was allegedly used to the benefit of officers and employees of the company as well as its directors. This included options backdating presented in offer letters to new hires. Annual and quarterly reports filed by the company did not include the compensation costs that stemmed from the options backdating incidents. Trident and its former executives agreed to settle the case without admitting or denying the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"SEC v.
