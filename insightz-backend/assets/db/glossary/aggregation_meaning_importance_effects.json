  "term": "Aggregation: Meaning, Importance, Effects",
  "definition": "Amilcar has 10 years of FinTech, blockchain, and crypto startup experience and advises financial institutions, governments, regulators, and startups.\n\nAggregation in the futures markets is a process that combines of all futures positions owned or controlled by a single trader or group of traders into one aggregate position. Aggregation in a financial planning sense, however, is a time-saving accounting method that consolidates an individual\u2019s financial data from various institutions.\n\nAggregation is increasingly popular with advisors when servicing clients\u2019 accounts, as they are able to discuss the accounts with the client in a cleaner, more easily understood way before they break down the account into its respective categories.\n\nFinancial advisors\u00a0use account-aggregation technology to gather position and transaction information from investors\u2019 retail accounts held at other financial institutions. Aggregators provide investors and their advisors with a centralized view of the investor\u2019s complete financial situation, including daily updates.\n\nFinancial plannershandle both managed and non-managed accounts. Managed accounts contain assets under the advisor\u2019s control that are held by the advisor\u2019s custodian. The planners utilize portfolio management and reporting software to capture a client\u2019s data through a direct link from the custodian. It is important for the planner to have all the accounts because aggregating them without the complete collection would paint an inaccurate picture of that client's finances.\n\nAdditionally, non-managed accounts contain assets that are not under the advisor's management but are nevertheless important to the client\u2019s financial plan. Examples include 401(k) accounts, personal checking orsavings accounts, pensions, and credit card accounts.\n\nThe advisor\u2019s concern with managed accounts is lack of accessibility when the client does not provide log-in information. Advisors cannot offer an all-encompassing approach to financial planning and asset management without daily updates on non-managed accounts.\n\nAccount aggregationservices solve the issue by providing a convenient method for obtaining current position and transaction information about accounts held at most\u00a0retail banks or brokerages. Because investors\u2019 privacy is protected, disclosing their personal-access information for each non-managed account is unnecessary.\n\nFinancial planners use aggregate account software for analyzing a client\u2019s total assets, liabilities, and net worth; income and expenses; and trends in assets, liability, net worth, and transaction values. The advisor also assesses various risks in a client\u2019s portfolio before making investment decisions.\n\nMany aggregation services offer direct data connections between brokerage firms and financial institutions, rather than using banks\u2019 consumer-facing websites. Clients give financial institutions their consent by providing personal information for the aggregate services.",
