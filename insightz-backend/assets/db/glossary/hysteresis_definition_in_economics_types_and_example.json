  "term": "Hysteresis: Definition in Economics, Types, and Example",
  "definition": "Hysteresis in the field of economics refers to an event in the economy that persists even after the factors that led to that event have been removed or otherwise run their course. Hysteresis often occurs following extreme or prolonged economic events such as an economic crash orrecession. After a recession, for example, the unemployment rate may continue to increase despite growth in the economy and the technical end of the recession.\n\nThe term hysteresis was coined by Sir James Alfred Ewing, a Scottish physicist and engineer to refer to systems, organisms, and fields that have memory. In other words, the consequences of some input are experienced with a certain time lag or delay. One example is seen with iron: iron maintains some magnetization after it has been exposed to and removed from a magnetic field.Hysteresis is derived from the Greek word meaning a coming short or a deficiency.\n\nHysteresis in economics arises when a single disturbance affects the course of the economy. The specific reasons for hysteresis vary depending on the precipitating event. That said, the persistence of a market malaise after the event has technically passed is most commonly attributed to changes in the attitudes of market participants due to the event. After a marketcrash, for example, many investors are reluctant to reinvest what cash they have on hand due to their recent losses. This reluctance translates to a longer period of depressed stock prices due to the attitude of investors rather than the market fundamentals.\n\nA common example of hysteresis is the delayed effects of unemployment where the unemployment rate can continue to rise even after the economy has begun recovering. The currentunemployment rateis a percentage of the number of people in an economy who are looking for work but can't find any.\n\nWhen a recession occurs,cyclical unemploymentrises as the economy experiences negative growth rates. Cyclical unemployment rises when the economy performs poorly and falls when the economy is in expansion.\n\nWhen the economy re-enters anexpansionary phase, it is expected that businesses would start re-hiring the unemployed and that the economy\u2019s unemployment rate would start declining towards its normal or natural unemployment rate until cyclical unemployment becomes zero. This is the ideal scenario, of course. However, hysteresis tells a different story.\n\nHysteresis states that as unemployment increases, more people adjust to a lowerstandard of living. As they become accustomed to the lower standard of living, people may not be as motivated to achieve the previously desired higher living standard. Also, as more people become unemployed, it becomes more socially acceptable to be or remain unemployed. After thelabor marketreturns to normal, some unemployed people may be disinterested in returning to the workforce. Last, and most significantly, employers themselves have undergone significant pain during a downturn and will be more likely to demand more of remaining workers before taking on the larger costs of adding to their workforce.\n\nOutput hysteresis can happen in the aftermath of economic downturns. It's the decline in investment and productivity when businesses curtail their investment activities during recessions. It often results in a reduction in the overall productivity of the economy.\n\nThe consequences of this diminished productivity can extend beyond the recessionary period. In practical terms, this implies that even when the economy begins to recover, it may struggle to regain the growth trajectory it maintained prior to the downturn. For instance, companies may be hesitant on committing long-term capital or being the first to introduce a new product to markets.\n\nIn the aftermath of economic downturns, governments and central banks must not only focus on short-term stimulus measures to address immediate economic challenges but also consider strategies to revive and sustain long-term growth. Mitigating output hysteresis may involve targeted policies aimed at encouraging investment, fostering innovation, and enhancing productivity in order to counteract the lasting impacts of economic contractions.\n\nFollowing a financial downturn, the initial response of banks is often totighten creditas they deal with increased risks and uncertainties. However, what distinguishes credit market hysteresis is the prolonged nature of these tightened conditions even after the crisis has abated. Banks, potentially hesitant by the experiences of the crisis, may remain risk-averse. They may be cautious with their lending practices and perpetuating a persistent credit crunch even though that may not necessarily be required.\n\nThis sustained restriction in credit availability has far-reaching implications for economic actors. Businesses find it challenging to secure the necessary financing for investments, expansion, and daily operations. Individuals face difficulties accessing credit for essential purposes like home purchases and education. The consequences of credit market hysteresis extend beyond the immediate post-crisis period, acting as a drag on the overall economic recovery.\n\nInflation hysteresis emerges when extended periods of either high or low inflation shape expectations for the future. When inflation remains persistently low, for example, it can instill the belief that this trend will continue. This can lead to expectations of ongoing low inflation and can make it hard forcentral banksstriving to maintain price stability.\n\nCentral banks may rely on the public's expectations of future inflation to guide their policy decisions. In cases of inflation hysteresis, where expectations become entrenched, it becomes more challenging for central banks to implement effective monetary policies. Central banks may enact policies they think are best; however, the general public may latch onto inflation beliefs that perpetuate beyond what is actually happening.\n\nHysteresis in unemployment can also be observed when businesses switch to automation during amarket downturn. Workers without the skills required to operate this machinery or newly installed technology will find themselves unemployable when the economy starts recovering. In addition to hiring only tech-savvy workers, these companies will ultimately hire fewer employees than before therecessionary phase. In effect, the loss of job skills will cause a movement of workers from the cyclical unemployment stage to the structural unemployment group. A rise in structural unemployment will lead to a rise in the natural unemployment rate.\n\nHysteresis can indicate a permanent change in the workforce from the loss of job skills making workers less employable even after a recession has ended.\n\nA tremendous example of hysteresis in the modern economy is the COVID-19 pandemic. On May 11, 2023, the Biden Administration ended the Public Health Emergency status of the crisis.However, many of the economic responses taken during the pandemic are still being felt into 2024.\n\nThe pandemic caused widespread job losses, particularly in sectors like hospitality and travel that were hit hard by lockdowns. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the leisure and hospitality industry will employ just over 16 million individuals by the year 2031. This would eventually compare closely to the 16.6 million individuals employed in 2019, though the point is the lag in market response.\n\nThe pandemic has also led to inflationary pressures.\u00a0For example, supply chain disruptions have increased the cost of goods, and these cost increases have often been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices. Note that despite easing rate hikes and monetary policy, the average monthly inflation rate of 4.1% in 2023 was still the third highest average of the millennium (behind only 2022 and 2021, respectively).\n\nThe last example related to the pandemic relates to consumer preference. There were many barriers presented to in-person shopping or consumption due to health restrictions. As a result, most Americans turned to online shopping.With those barriers largely removed post-pandemic, there's a lot of evidence that showspost-pandemic consumer behaviorhas changed. This can loosely be defined as hysteresis as, with the barriers removed and market conditions largely where they were pre-pandemic, consumers have not yet returned (and may not return) to what the trend was before.\n\nEconomies that are experiencing a recession and hysteresis, in which the natural rate of unemployment is rising, usually employ economic stimulus to combat the resulting cyclical unemployment.Expansionary monetary policiesby central banks, such as theFederal Reserve, can include lowering interest rates so as to make loans cheaper and help stimulate the economy. An expansionary fiscal policy might also include increases in government spending in regions or industries that are most affected by unemployment.\n\nHowever, hysteresis is more than cyclical unemployment and can persist long after the economy has recovered. For long-term issues, such as a lack of skills due to workers displaced by technological advances, job training programs might be helpful to combat hysteresis.\n\nHysteresis in financial markets takes various forms, including credit market hysteresis, investor sentiment towards inflation, or manufacturing output.\n\nPreemptive structural reforms involve anticipating potential sources of hysteresis and implementing changes to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the economy. Labor market reforms, regulatory adjustments, and initiatives promoting innovation can mitigate the impact of economic shocks, though there's usually greater risk in longer-term policies compared to short-term strategies.\n\nThe banking sector's hysteresis, arising from financial crises, can lead to persistent cautious lending practices even after the crisis abates. This ongoing prudence in lending may contribute to a prolonged credit squeeze, making it tough for consumers and businesses to get loans.\n\nPublic debt hysteresis occurs when high levels of public debt limit a government's fiscal flexibility. The need to service debt may lead to prolonged periods of hysteresis as the government may not have the ability to spend in other critical areas in the future.\n\nHysteresis, in the context of finance, refers to the lasting impact of past economic events on the current state of financial markets. It highlights how shocks and disruptions, such as financial crises, can lead to persistent effects, influencing market behavior, credit conditions, and overall economic performance over an extended period.\n\nJames Alfred Ewing. \"On time-lag in the magnetisation of iron.\" Royal Society, 1890.\n\nThe White House. \"Fact Sheet: Actions Taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to Ensure Continued COVID-19 Protections and Surge Preparedness After Public Health Emergency Transition.\"\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. \"Leisure and Hospitality Projected to Mostly Cover Pandemic-Driven Employment Losses.\"\n\nU.S. Inflation Calculator. \"Current U.S. Inflation Rates: 2000-2024.\"\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"How Consumer Behaviors Changed In Response to COVID-19 Lockdown Stringency Measures: A Case Study of Walmart.\"",
