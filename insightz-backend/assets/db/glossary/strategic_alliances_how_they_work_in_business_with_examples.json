She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA strategic alliance is an arrangement between two companies to undertake a mutually beneficial project while each retains its independence. A company may enter into a strategic alliance to expand into a new market, enlarge its product line, or develop an edge over competitors. In some cases, strategic alliances can involve more than two companies.\n\nAt the heart of strategic alliances lies companies that are striving to grow but may not have the resources to embark on certain initiatives. Instead of going it alone, they can look for other companies with the needed resources or expertise to partner with.\n\nConsider the massive client base ofUber. While Uber had an interest in making the ridership experience as pleasant as possible, single-handedly building out its own repository of music that riders could enjoy on demand would have been a costly challenge. So Uber turned to Spotify to enter into a strategic alliance.\n\nSpotify, for its part, could boast of a well-developed technological product that was ready for a wider consumer audience (exactly what Uber had to offer). By forming a strategic alliance in which Uber provided the consumers and Spotify the technology, the two companies came together to create a market opportunity that neither could have achieved on its own.\n\nThough less formal than some other types of business arrangements, a strategic alliance typically involves contracts that spell out the obligations of each alliance member.\n\nStrategic alliances can come in many sizes and forms. Some generic examples:\n\nThere are three primary forms of strategic alliances:\n\nAjoint ventureoccurs when two companies come together to create an entirely new, separate company that each of the existing companies becomes a parent to.\n\nFor example, in 2012, Microsoft and General Electric Healthcare signed a joint agreement to create a new, third company called Caradigm, with each of them owning 50%.Caradigm's mission was to develop and market an open healthcare intelligence platform. The idea behind the joint venture was that Microsoft had the technical capability of making such a platform work, while GE's healthcare IT division had the expertise on the healthcare side.\n\nIn 2016, GE Healthcare bought out Microsoft's share in the company. Then, in 2018, it sold the entirety of Caradigm to Inspirata.\n\nAnequitystrategic alliance may have similar outcome goals as a joint venture. However, it is funded differently in that one company makes an equity investment into another.\n\nFor example, in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million in the automakerTeslaby purchasing shares of Tesla common stock in aprivate placement.The investment was intended to build a stronger alliance between the two companies and to help expand Panasonic's footprint in the electric vehicle market. As one of the world's leading battery cell manufacturers, Panasonic's skill set blended strongly with Tesla's ambition to improve its battery packs and reduce its costs.\n\nThe relationship between the two companies continues to this day.\n\nIn a non-equity strategic alliance, two entities come together without an exchange of equity. Each company simply brings its resources to the alliance for the mutual benefit of both. The relationship between Barnes & Noble and Starbucks is one highly visible example. Starbucks brews the coffee. Barnes & Noble stocks the books. Both companies do what they do best while sharing the costs of retail space to the their mutual benefit.\n\nThere are many reasons that a company might choose to enter into a strategic alliance. They include:\n\nStrategic alliances often form between companies with varying business or product cycles. For example, companies with short cycles may seek companies that have made long-term investments to aid in the rapid development of a product that would otherwise require more time.\n\nForming a strategic alliance requires creativity, forward thinking, and savvy business sense. Though strategic alliances can differ in many respects, most involve some common steps:\n\nAs with any major business decision, strategic alliances have potential upsides and downsides that are worth thinking through.\n\nA strategic alliance can allow a company to take advantage of new opportunities it would otherwise miss out on. This could include adding new clients, branching out into in new markets, or creating and selling new products. Each of these avenues has the potential to increase a company's revenue and profitability.\n\nStrategic alliances are also a way to diversify a company'srevenue streamand mitigate company-wide financial risk. Alliances can also mitigate risk because companies with expertise in different areas give each other access to the resources to solve unique challenges or navigate unfamiliar business scenarios.\n\nFinally, strategic alliances can benefit a company's image if it partners with another well-respected company, especially one that has an established presence in different markets.\n\nA strategic alliance is most likely to succeed if there is strong communication between the partners. This means both parties must continually expend resources to manage the alliance and ensure that both sides are in sync and in agreement. In addition, if there are major disagreements between the alliance members, they may waste resources on resolving conflicts that would not have occurred had there been no alliance.\n\nThough both parties should gain from a strategic alliance, one company will often benefit more than the other, and there may not be a simple solution to balance that out. There may also develop an unnatural reliance on one side or the other in terms of resources or expertise.\n\nJust as a strategic alliance can sometimes burnish a company's public image, the opposite can also happen. One company's misdeeds can harm the other's reputation, even though it may have had nothing to do with them.\n\nMay result in gaining customers, especially ones in unfamiliar markets\n\nMay generate additional revenue and increase profitability\n\nMay diversify a company's revenue stream\n\nMay reduce operational risk of a company due to the addition of unique expertise and assets\n\nMay positively influence the image the company\n\nMay require more work in collaborating and communicating with larger teams\n\nMay result in costly conflicts should the alliance members disagree on strategy\n\nMay result in one side getting a better deal than the other (even if this wasn't what was planned)\n\nMay negatively influence the image of the company\n\nStrategic alliances are important because they enable a company to benefit by leveraging the assets of another company.\n\nAn alliance is a collaboration between two companies in which each company is expected to profit or benefit from the agreement. Apartnershipis a more formal type of agreement in which partners combine to create a single, shared economic interest.\n\nIn an alliance, two companies agree to cooperate on a particular project. In anacquisitionone company simply buys the other.\n\nA strategic alliance creates a relationship between two entities. For this reason, the most important factor in the success or failure of an alliance is maintaining the trust and effective collaboration between their teams. The alliance must be guided by clear objectives to make sure both sides stay on the same page.\n\nA strategic alliance is an agreement between two parties for the mutual benefit of both. While there are many examples of successful strategic alliances, companies also have to be careful to choose the right partners and make sure that the alliance's goals are clear and well-understood from the outset.\n\nMicrosoft. \"Microsoft and GE Healthcare Complete Joint Venture Agreement.\"\n\nZDNET. \"Microsoft Quietly Sold Its Stake in Caradigm Health Venture With GE.\"\n\nInspirata. \"Award-Winning Platform to Accelerate Development of Cancer Information Data Trust.\"\n\nTesla. \"Panasonic Invests $30 Million in Tesla.\"\n\nGlobal Fleet. \"Mass(ive) Production and Price Cuts: How Did the Tesla - Panasonic Alliance Thrive Over the Years?\"",
