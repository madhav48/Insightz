  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn inherited IRA is an account that is opened when an you inherit an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan after the original owner dies. The individual inheriting the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) (the beneficiary) may be anyone\u2014a spouse, relative, unrelated party, or entity (e.g., estate or trust).Rules on how to handlean inherited IRA differ for spouses and non-spouses, however. Learn more about how inherited IRAs work.\n\nAn inherited IRA is also known as a \"beneficiary IRA.\"\u00a0Many of thetop brokers for IRAsprovide support in resolving matters related to the inheritance of IRA assets, taxation issues, and continuation of retirement account status.\n\nTax laws surrounding inherited IRAs are quite complicated, and they became even more so with theSetting Every Community Up For Retirement Enhancement (SECURE)Act of 2019, which made some significant changes to the regulations\u2014mainly for non-spousal heirs.\n\nA beneficiary may open an inherited IRA using the proceeds from any type of IRA, including traditional, Roth, rollover, SEP, and SIMPLE IRAs. Generally, assets held in the deceased individual\u2019s IRA must betransferred into a new inherited IRAin the beneficiary\u2019s name.\n\nThis transfer must be made even if a lump-sum distribution is planned. You cannot make additional contributions to an inherited IRA.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service provides guidelines for inherited IRA beneficiaries.IRS forms1099-R and 5498are required for reporting inherited IRAs and their distributions for tax purposes.\n\nInherited IRAs are treated the same, whether they are traditional IRAs orRoth IRAs. The tax treatment of withdrawals does vary\u2014consistent with the type of IRA (funded with pre-tax dollars, like the traditional type, or post-tax dollars, like with the Roth).\n\nSpouses have more flexibility in how to handle an inherited IRA. For one, they can roll over the IRA, or a part of the IRA, into their own existing individual retirement accounts. The advantage of this rollover is the ability to deferrequired minimum distributions (RMDs)of the funds until they reach the age of 73.\n\nRMDs previously began at 70\u00bd, but the age was raised to 72 following the December 2019 passage of the Setting Every Community Up For Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. This limit has since been increased again to 73 as part of SECURE 2.0 Act.\n\nThey have 60 days from receiving a distribution to roll it over into their own IRAs as long as the distribution is not a required minimum distribution.\n\nSpousal heirs can also set up a separate inheritedIRA account, as described above. How they deal with this IRA depends on the age of the deceased account holder.\n\nIf the original owner had already begun receiving RMDs at the time of\u00a0death, the spousal beneficiary must continue to receive the distributions as\u00a0calculated or submit a new schedule based on their own life expectancy. If the owner had not yet committed to an RMD schedule or reached theirrequired beginning date (RBD)\u2014the age at which they had to begin RMDs\u2014the beneficiary of the IRA has a five-year window to withdraw the funds, which would then be subject to income taxes.\n\nNon-spouse beneficiariesmay not treat an inherited IRA as their own. That is, they may not make additional contributions to the account nor can they transfer inherited funds into their existing IRA account. Non-spouses may not leave assets in the original IRA. They must set up a new inherited IRA account unless they want to distribute the assets immediately via a lump-sum payment.\n\nIt is in the realm of distributions that the SECURE Act most significantly affects non-spouse inheritors of IRAs. Previously, these beneficiaries could handle RMDs as spousal heirs could. Specifically, they could recalculate them based on their own life expectancy\u2014which often significantly decreased the annual amount that had to be withdrawn and the tax due on them (in the case of traditional IRAs).\n\nIf you inherit a Roth IRA, you are required to take distributions (unlike the original account owners). But the funds remain tax-free and also free of any early-withdrawal penalty, even if you're under 59\u00bd.\n\nNow, the SECURE Act dictates that, for accounts inherited after Dec. 31, 2019, non-spouse beneficiaries typically must cash out the account within 10 years of the original owner's death.Some heirs are exempted:\n\nFor beneficiaries in these categories and those who already have inherited IRAs, the old distribution rules and schedules apply. There's no particular timetable for the withdrawals. You can take the money out in small withdrawals or all at once.\n\nIRA beneficiaries have several options for claiming their inheritance, but choices depend on their relationship to the decedent. All beneficiaries have the option to receive a lump sum distribution of the funds or disclaim the inheritance.\n\nDepending on the type of account inherited, natural beneficiaries may elect to leave the proceeds in the plan. Spouses have the most options, followed by natural non-spousal beneficiaries. Non-natural beneficiaries have the fewest options.\n\nAs a spouse inheriting IRA funds, you have the most options for protecting and receiving your inherited funds. You may elect to:\n\nNon-spousal beneficiaries include natural persons and non-natural persons. For non-natural persons, such as charities, businesses, trusts, and estates, funds can be distributed as a lump sum or transferred into an Inherited IRA in the name of the beneficiary.\n\nFor natural non-spousal beneficiaries, funds can be:\n\nThe recipient of an inherited IRA may or may not pay taxes depending on their situation. In general, if you inherit a Roth IRA, you're free of taxes. However, if you inherit a traditional IRA, any amount withdrawn is often subject to taxes. On the other hand, estates subject to the estate tax may also be allowed an income-tax deduction for the estate taxes paid on the IRA.\n\nIf a child is not yet of age, a custodian may manage the money in the IRA until the child reaches the state's recognized age of adulthood. Then, at that time, the child would have complete access to the funds. They may choose to withdraw funds from the IRA but depending on the type of account, they may be subject to taxes on withdrawal.\n\nSome of the strongest tax-avoidance strategies for an inherited IRA are executed before the original owner passes away. In many cases, it's best for the individual to convert a traditional IRA to a Roth IRA (to potentially minimize the tax burden, especially after their passing). In addition, individuals inheriting IRAs can choose to not take non-qualifying distributions that would otherwise be taxable.\n\nMany individuals leverage traditional and Roth IRAs to plan for their retirement. Unfortunately, people may pass away before they make it to retirement age or withdraw all funds from their account. Inherited Roth IRAs often have better tax avoidance capabilities, though those inheriting traditional IRAs will be further constrained. In addition, traditional IRAs will have greater RMD requirements.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - Beneficiary.\"\n\nUnited States Congress. \"H.R. 2617.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - Beneficiary.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cLife Insurance & Disability Insurance Proceeds.\u201d",
