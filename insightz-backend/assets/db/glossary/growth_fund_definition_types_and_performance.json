The portfolio mainly consists of companies with above-average growth that reinvest theirearningsinto expansion,acquisitions, orresearch and development\u00a0(R&D). Most growth funds offer higher potential capital appreciation but usually at above-average risk.\n\nThe high-risk, high-reward mantra of growth funds can make them ideal for those not retiring anytime soon. Typically, investors need atolerance for riskand aholding periodwith a time horizon of five to ten years. Growth fund holdings often have highprice-to-earnings (P/E)andprice-to-sales (P/S)multiples. This trade-off from investors is the above-averagerevenueand earnings gains these companies produce.\n\nGrowth funds, along withvalue fundsand blend funds, are one of the main types ofmutual fundsandexchange traded funds (ETFs)They are more volatile than funds in the value and blend categories. Growth funds are typically split bymarket capitalization, with funds representing small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap groupings.\n\nLarge-cap growth mutual funds are one of the largest types of mutual funds in terms of market share. Large-blend funds, which offer investors value and growth, are also very popular. Foreign large-cap growth funds are much lower in terms of market share.\n\nForeign growth funds are becoming more common for investors who want to take advantage of global growth. These funds invest in international stocks posting strong revenue and earnings growth. For international growth funds, technology and consumer sectors are the most common. Large internet names such as Tencent (TCTZF), Baidu (BIDU), and Alibaba (BABA) can be found among the top ten holdings for many international growth funds.\n\nOne of the largest growth funds is the Growth Fund of America (AGTHX) from American Funds. This mutual fund has over $253\u00a0billion inassets under management(AUM) as of March 2022 and the stock price is up 10% over the last year, despite the marketvolatility.
