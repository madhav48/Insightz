  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA beneficiary is an individual or organization that inherits assets from someone upon their passing.\n\nA beneficiary is an individual designated to receive the belongings or assets of another person after that person's death. Beneficiaries often receive these benefits as an inheritance.\n\nA beneficiary can be designated in the documents relating to a life insurance policy, a retirement account,a brokerage account, a bank account, and other financial products.\n\nIt's important to designate beneficiaries for your financial assets so that they can be distributed according to your wishes when you pass away.\n\nAny person or organization can benamed a beneficiaryof someone's property.\n\nThe individual who owns the property or the benefactor can put various stipulations on thedisbursementof the property. These might include the requirement that a beneficiary is a certain age or is married before taking control of the inherited property.\n\nThere can be tax consequences for the beneficiary when inheriting certain financial assets. For example, if someone is the beneficiary of a life insurance policy, it's useful to know that while the principal of most policies is not taxed, theaccrued interestmight be.\n\nFailure to name beneficiaries for your financial accounts means that the assets of your accounts must be distributed through your will.\n\nIf you designate beneficiaries in the paperwork of the financial accounts, the accounts or their value pass directly to those individuals, avoidingprobate.\n\nBeneficiaries designated on the paperwork for financial accounts override any beneficiary listed in a will.\n\nFailure to name beneficiaries in a will can tie up your property in probate, potentially for years. It can leave the decision about how to distribute your assets up to the state in which you live.\n\nIn such a case, the people for whom you wanted to provide financial support after your death may not receive it. Or they may have to wait a long time for it.\n\nWhen you pass away without a will in place, you\u2019re deemedintestateand your assets are distributed not necessarily to your chosen beneficiaries but according to state inheritance laws.\n\nIt's important to designate beneficiaries for your financial property so that you can feel confident that the people you've decided your money should go to are assured of receiving it.\n\nThe primary beneficiary is the first choice of beneficiary made by a financial account owner. While other beneficiaries also may be listed in account or estate documents, this person or organization will receive all of the assets in the account.\n\nA contingent beneficiary is a secondary beneficiary. They receive the account benefits only if the primary beneficiary is no longer living or cannot be located. You can name more than one contingent beneficiary and specify how the assets would be divided between them.\n\nBeneficiaries can be designated for all of your important assets, including property, insurance policies, retirement accounts, brokerage accounts,bank accounts, and more.\n\nWhen selecting your beneficiaries:\n\nUpon first opening your financial accounts, companies ask that you provide beneficiary information. If you don't provide it at that time, you can request the paperwork at a later date.\n\nFill it out, sign and date it, and return it to the company. You may be able to complete this process online (check with your financial institution). Maintain a copy of this information for your files.\n\nMinor children can\u2019t directly receive the proceeds of a life insurance policy, but you could name a trust or your children\u2019s legal guardian as a beneficiary.\n\nAnindividual retirement account (IRA)gives the account holder the ability to designate a beneficiary or beneficiaries.\n\nThe options for distribution of the assets are different depending on whether the beneficiary is aneligible designated beneficiaryor a designated beneficiary.\n\nEach beneficiary type may take alump-sum distributionof the proceeds, if desired.If not, the choices are as follows.\n\nEligible Designated Beneficiary\n\nAn eligible designated beneficiary is a spouse, the minor child of the account owner, someone less than 10 years younger than the account owner (e.g., a family member or friend), or someone who is chronically ill or disabled.\n\nA designated beneficiary is someone who is listed in the account records as a beneficiary but who doesn't fit into the category of an eligible designated beneficiary. For example, an adult child could be a designated beneficiary.\n\nIf the beneficiary is either an estate or a trust (referred to as a non-designated beneficiary), the executor or trustee directs the distribution of assets. They may open an inherited IRA account and distribute assets according to the rules for a non-designated beneficiary.\n\nIf you have an inherited IRA account, be aware that the IRS announced its long-awaited ruling in mid-2024 that certain designated beneficiaries must withdraw (as also described above) at least the RMD for every year of the 10-year withdrawal period. You must use thelife expectancy factorto determine this RMD. Your financial institution might figure this out for you.\n\nNot all relevant IRS documentation has been updated yet to reflect this information, and thus can be confusing.\n\nLife insuranceproceeds are tax-free for the beneficiary and are not reported as gross income. However, any interest received or accrued is taxable.\n\nLife insurance beneficiaries can be individuals, such as a spouse or an adult child, or entities, such as atrust. For example, if you have minor children, you may choose to establish a trust and name it as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy.\n\nIf you were to pass away, then the policy\u2019s death benefit would be paid to the trust. The trustee would then manage those assets according to the terms of the trust on behalf of its beneficiaries (i.e., your minor children).\n\nLife insurance beneficiaries can be revocable or irrevocable.Revocable beneficiariescan be changed if necessary at any time during the policy owner\u2019s lifetime. This is similar to a revocable living trust, which can also be changed as long as the trust grantor is still living.\n\nAnirrevocable beneficiaryis permanent. If there are multiple beneficiaries named to a life insurance policy (e.g., aprimary beneficiaryand severalcontingent beneficiaries), then they would all need to consent to any changes involving an irrevocable beneficiary. Therefore, it's important to choose beneficiaries carefully.\n\nA beneficiary is a person or organization that has been named to receive property belonging to another person in the event of their death.\n\nIf you don't choose one or more beneficiaries for your assets, then the decision about what happens to your money will be made by someone other than you, such as a court in the state in which you live.\n\nIt's not difficult at all, once you've decided on who your beneficiary or beneficiaries should be. Designating beneficiaries for your financial accounts involves providing the names,Social Security numbers, and other specifics on a form when you open your account. If your accounts have already been opened, simply request the appropriate form for designating beneficiaries, fill it out, and return it to your financial institution. Keep a copy for your files.\n\nIn the case of a life insurance policy that has one or more revocable beneficiaries, the owner of the policy can change the beneficiary designations at any time. This is something that may be necessary if a beneficiary passes away or if the primary beneficiary is a spouse and the marriage ends in divorce.\n\nIf irrevocable beneficiaries are named to a life insurance policy, then the policy owner would need the consent of the beneficiary and any contingent beneficiaries to make a change. For that reason, it\u2019s important to think carefully when choosing policy beneficiaries.\n\nDesignating beneficiaries is a very important part of estate planning. If you care about the disposition of your financial assets after you're gone, then choosing beneficiaries for your financial accounts should be a priority.\n\nBy designating beneficiaries, you can ensure that your property winds up in the right hands.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Life Insurance & Disability Insurance Proceeds.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"The Probate Process.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Introduction to Wills.\"\n\nUSAA. \"Can Minors Be Beneficiaries on Life Insurance?\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - Beneficiary.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs),\" Pages 9-11.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 590-B, Distributions from Individual Retirement Arrangements (IRAs),\" Pages 12-13.\n\nKiplinger. \"IRS Ends Inherited IRA Confusion: Annual RMDs Required for Many.\"",
