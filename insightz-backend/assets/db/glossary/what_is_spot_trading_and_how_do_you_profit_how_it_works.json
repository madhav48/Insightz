He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe term spot trade refers to the purchase or sale of a foreign currency, financial instrument,\u00a0or commodity for instant delivery on a specified spot date. Most spot contracts include thephysical deliveryof the currency, commodity, or instrument to the buyer. In a foreign exchange spot trade, the exchange rate on which the transaction is based is referred to as the spot exchange rate. A spot trade can be contrasted with a forward or futures trade.\n\nAs noted above, a spot trade is a financial transaction that involves acommodity, foreign currency, or financial instrument. This type of trade is also commonly referred to as a spot transaction. These types of transactions can take place on an exchange orover the counter (OTC).

The spotforeign exchange markettrades electronically around the world. It is the world's largest market, with over $7.55 trillion traded daily. As such, its size dwarfs both the interest rate and commodity markets.\n\nThe current price of a financial instrument is called thespot price. It is the price at which an instrument can be sold or bought immediately. Buyers and sellers create the spot price by posting their\u00a0buy and sell orders. Inliquidmarkets, the spot price may change by the second, as outstanding orders getfilledand new ones enter the marketplace.\n\nThe difference in the price of afuture or forward contract versus a spot contracttakes into account thetime valueof the payment based on interest rates and the time to maturity.\n\nThe price for any instrument that settles later than the spot is a combination of the spot price and the interest cost until thesettlement date. In the case of forex, the interest ratedifferentialbetween the two currencies is used for this calculation.\n\nMost interest rate products, such as bonds andoptions, trade for spot settlement on the next business day. Contracts are most commonly between two financial institutions, but they can also be between a company and a financial institution.

These instruments include commodities, currencies, and other securities. Buyers and sellers normally exchange cash for the noted security in the spot market, which is why they're normally called cash or physical markets.\n\nA spot price is the current market price quoted for immediate delivery for a financial instrument, such as a currency, commodity, or interest rate.

A spot price is used to determine future prices.\n\nSpot and forward rates are two prices used in the foreign exchange market. The term spot rate refers to the current market price quote for immediate delivery. Spot rates are used for currencies, commodities, interest rates, and other securities. A forward, rate, on the other hand, is a future price that two parties agree upon for a currency or other security.\n\nSpot trading is the exchange of a financial instrument for immediate delivery on a certain spot date.
