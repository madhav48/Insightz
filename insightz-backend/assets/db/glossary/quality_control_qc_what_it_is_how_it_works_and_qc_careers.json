  "term": "Quality Control (QC): What It Is, How It Works, and QC Careers",
  "definition": "Quality control is a process employed by businesses to ensure that their products are manufactured to meet defined quality standards.\n\nQuality control (QC) is a system that ensures that manufactured products are produced and maintained to a high standard. Quality control requires companies to create an environment where management and employees strive for perfection. This is done by training personnel, creating product qualitybenchmarks, and testing products forstatistically significantvariations.\n\nQC requires theestablishment of well-defined controlsto help standardize production and reactions to quality issues.\n\nCreating a product is costly, time-consuming, and can be unsafe without controls in place. A company that puts defective products on the market may be held liable for injuries or issues that arise from using its products. Quality control inspectors ensure thatdefective or unsafe products are identified, and that the causes are corrected.\n\nQuality control involves testing units and determining if they are within the specifications for the final product. Testing is done to determine if there is any need for corrective actions in the manufacturing process. Good quality control helps companies meet consumer demands for better products.\n\nQuality testing is generally completed in each step of amanufacturingor business process. Employees often begin by testingraw materials, pulling samples from the manufacturing line, and testing the finished product. Testing at various manufacturing stages helps identify where a production problem occurs and the remedial steps required to prevent it in the future.\n\nIn a nonmanufacturing business, quality testing can involvecustomer serviceevaluations, questionnaires, surveys, inspections, or audits. A business can use any process or method to verify that its end product or service meets the customer\u2019s needs and is safe and legal.\n\nLimiting room for error by specifying which production activities are to be completed by which personnel reduces the chance that employees will be involved in tasks for which they do not have adequate training.\n\nQC used in a business is highly dependent on the product orindustry. There may be different processes and regulations that apply. For example:\n\nQuality control and quality assurance (QA) are terms often used to define the same thing, but there are distinct differences. Quality control focuses on quality requirements, such as ensuring a part meets specifications. Quality assurance, on the other hand, refers to the sum of all actions and processes needed to demonstrate that quality requirements are fulfilled.\n\nWhat this difference means for quality professionals is that as you move through a quality control career, you might transition from quality control to quality assurance. Quality control is part of quality assurance, which consists of programs and departments that assure upper-level management, customers, and government inspectors that products meet all qualityrequirements and safety standards.\n\nThere are several methods quality control uses to communicate and track inspections and issues. For instance, aquality control chartis a graphic that depicts whether sampled products or processes are meeting their intended specifications\u2014and, if not, the degree by which they vary from those specifications.\n\nWhen one chart analyzes a specific product attribute, it is called a univariate chart. A chart that measures variances in several product attributes is called a multivariate chart. Tracking variances allows businesses to see how many defects per production unit they produce and what types of defects are occurring. Here are a few examples of some methods used.\n\nRandomly selected products are tested for the given attributes the chart is tracking. A common form of a quality control chart is the X-bar chart, where the y-axis on the graph tracks the degree to which the variance of the tested attribute is acceptable. The x-axis tracks the samples tested. Analyzing the variance pattern on this chart helps you determine if defects are occurring randomly or systematically.\n\nTheTaguchi methodis another approach to quality control that emphasizes the roles ofresearch and development (R&D), product design, and product development in reducing the occurrence of defects and failures in products. This method considers design more important than the manufacturing process in quality control and tries to eliminate variances in production before they can occur.\n\nThis 100% inspection method is a quality control process that looks at and assesses all product parts. This type of quality control is done to rule out flaws in products. It often evaluates valuable metals and calls for data about the manufacturing process and software to analyzeinventory.\n\nThe challenge of using this method is that looking at every single item used to build a product is expensive and could destabilize or render the product unusable. For example, if you use this method to examine organic strawberries, you risk damaging the berries, rendering them unsellable.\n\nQuality control methods help standardize production and reactions to quality issues in various industries, from food production to automobile manufacturing.\n\nQuality control can be a rewarding career if you enjoy working with people, communicating, presenting results, and working to make products better and safer. Here\u2019s what you may need to become one.\n\nTo become a quality control inspector, you\u2019ll need a high school diploma for entry-level positions and higher education for advanced jobs. Many companies prefer candidates with prior work experience in their industry. It also helps if you\u2019re licensed or certified in your field. For instance, the American Society for Quality offers certification for quality control professionals, which can increase your earning potential.\n\nOther qualities needed for quality control professionals are:\n\nThe route to a career in quality control and assurance varies by industry, so there may be differences. However, you\u2019ll generally need several years of experience in your industry. Typically, you begin by being hired as a quality assurance or control associate after meeting educational and work experience requirements.\n\nOnce you gain work experience, you may move into a senior specialist position and begin managing teams of quality control specialists. You may attend professional development courses sponsored by your employer or be required to gain certifications such asSix Sigma.You might also need to earn a professional designation such as Certified Quality Inspector.\n\nMoving up the career path, you have more options. You may be able to choose from or be selected to be a QA systems manager, QA operations manager, or QA compliance manager. These positions can lead up to upper-level management or executive levels within quality control:\n\nThe average pay for quality control professionals differs by industry, experience, and position. Pay increases as you gain more experience and move into management positions. As of May 2024, the U.S.Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)reports average salaries as:\n\nA quality control inspector audits and evaluates a company\u2019s manufacturing and operational processes. They do this by monitoring products throughout the entire production process to ensure they meet the highest standards before they are put on the market. This means reviewing everything from the raw materials used to produce the goods up to the finished products.\n\nQuality control ensures that defective goods don\u2019t go out to the public. Companies that have quality control methods in place often have employees who pay close attention to their work.\n\nIn food and drug manufacturing, quality control prevents products that make customers sick, and in manufacturing, quality control can ensure that accidents don\u2019t happen when people use a product.\n\nThree examples of quality control could be in the food industry: overseeing the ingredient specifications, reviewing supplier lists, and ensuring the facility where the food product is made is sanitary.\n\nQuality control can fail for several reasons. It can go wrong when there are no clear standards for production, no protocols in place during the manufacturing process, and a lack of training for employees. Problems also arise when companies don\u2019t address and remedy issues right away.\n\nQuality control helps a business ensure its product quality and overall success. The environment influences employees\u2019 attitudes about the workplace and creates a sense of ownership of the products and company. QC can involve training personnel, creating data-driven tools, testing products, and setting standards.\n\nQuality control methods help create a safe work environment and products that are safe to use and meet customers\u2019 needs. Additionally, QC is a rewarding career for someone who enjoys investigating issues and improving outcomes.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Quality Control Inspectors: How To Become a Quality Control Inspector.\u201d\n\nAmerican Society for Quality. \u201cCertification.\u201d\n\nThe Council for Six Sigma Certification. \u201cSix Sigma Certifications.\u201d\n\nAmerican Society for Quality. \u201cQuality Inspector Certification CQI.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cOccupational Outlook Handbook: Quality Control Inspectors: Pay.\u201d",
