  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nCash flow from investing is included on a company's cash flow statement along with cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from financing activities.\n\nCash flow from investing activities (CFI) is one section of a company's cash flow statement. It reports how much cash has been generated or spent from investment-related activities in a specific period.\n\nInvesting activities include purchases ofphysical assets, investments in securities, or the sale of securities or assets. Investment may generate income or ensure the long-term health or performance of the company.\n\nThere are three main financial statements that a business uses: the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. Thebalance sheetprovides an overview of a company's assets, liabilities, and owners' equity as of a specific date. Theincome statementprovides an overview of the company's revenues and expenses during a period.\n\nThe cash flow statement bridges the gap between the income statement and the balance sheet by showing how much cash is generated or spent on operating, investing, and financing activities for a specific period.\n\nThe cash flow statement provides an account of the cash used in operations, includingworking capital, financing, and investing. There are three sections on the cash flow statement: cash flow from investing activities, cash flow from operating activities, and cash flow from financing activities.\n\nInvesting activities may generate either negative or positive cash flow. Purchases require spending money, which generates negative cash flow. Sales produce income, which generates positive cash flow.\n\nCash flows from investing activities provide an account of cash used in the purchase ofnon-current assets, also known as long-term assets, that will deliver value in the future.\n\nInvesting activity is an important aspect of growth and capital. A change toproperty, plant, and equipment (PPE), a large line item on the balance sheet, is considered an investing activity. When investors and analysts want to know how much a company spends on PPE, they can look for the sources and uses of funds in the investing section of the cash flow statement.\n\nCapital expenditures (CapEx) are also found in this section. This item is a popular measure of capital investment used in the valuation of stocks. An increase in capital expenditures means the company is investing in future operations. However, capital expenditures are a reduction in cash flow.\u00a0Typically, companies with significant capital expenditures are in a state of growth.\n\nBesides cash flow from investing, the two additional cash flow activities are operational and financial.Operating activitiesinclude any inflow or outflow that is part of a company's daily operations. Any cash spent or generated from the company's products or services is listed in this section. This may include cash from the sale of goods, interest payments, employee salaries, inventory payments, or income tax payments.\n\nCash generated or spent onfinancing activitiesshows the net cash flows involved in funding the company's operations. Financing activities include dividend payments,stock repurchases, or bond offerings that generate cash.\n\nIt's best to analyze the cash flow statement in tandem with the balance sheet and income statement to get a complete picture of a company's financial health.\n\nBelow is the cash flow statement from Apple Inc. according to the company's10-Qreport issued on Nov. 2, 2023.The three sections of Apple's statement of cash flows are listed with operating activities at the top and financing activities at the bottom of the statement. In the center are the investing activities.\n\nInvesting activities that were cash-flow negative include:\n\nInvesting activities that were cash flow positive include:\n\nThe net cash flows generated from investing activities were $3.71 billion for the twelve months ending Sept. 30, 2023. Overall, Apple had a positive cash flow from investing activity despite spending nearly $30 billion on the purchase of marketable securities.\n\nIn general, negative cash flow can be an indicator of a company's poor performance.\u00a0However, negative cash flow from investing activities may indicate that significant amounts of cash have been invested in the long-term health of the company, such as research and development. While this may lead to short-term losses, the long-term result could mean significant growth.\n\nSuppose a company spent $30 billion on capital expenditures, of which the majority were fixed assets. It also purchased $5 billion in investments and spent $1 billion on acquisitions. The company realized a positive inflow of $3 billion from the sale of investments. To calculate the cash flow from investing activities, the sum of these items equals -$33 billion.\n\nCash flow from investing activities shows how a company is allocating cash for the long term. For instance, a company may invest in fixed assets such as property, plant, and equipment to grow the business. While this signals a negative cash flow from investing activities in the short term, it may help the company generate cash flow in the long term.\n\nThe cash flow statement is one of the three financial reports that a company generates in an accounting period. One of the sections of the cash flow statement is cash flow from investing activities. These can either be positive or negative. Negative cash flow may signal that the company is investing in assets or other long-term development activities important to the health and continued operations of the company.\n\nApple. \"23-11-02 Apple Reports Fourth Quarter Results,\" Page 3.",
