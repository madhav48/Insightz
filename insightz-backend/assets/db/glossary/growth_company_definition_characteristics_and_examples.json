  "term": "Growth Company: Definition, Characteristics, and Examples",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA growth company is any company whose business generates significant positivecash flowsor earnings, which increase at significantly faster rates than the overall economy. A growth company tends to have very profitable reinvestment opportunities for its ownretained earnings. Thus, it typically pays little to no dividends to stockholders,\u00a0opting instead to put most or all of its profits back into its expanding business.\n\nGrowth companies have characterized the technology industry. The quintessential example of a growth company is Google, which has\u00a0grown revenues, cash flows, and earnings\u00a0substantially since itsinitial public offering(IPO).\n\nGrowth companies\u2014alsoknown as gazelles\u2014are expected to increase their revenues and profits markedly in the future. Thus, the market bids up their share prices to high valuations. This contrasts with mature companies, such as utility companies, which tend to report\u00a0stable earnings with little to no growth.\n\nGrowth companies create value by continuing to expand above-average earnings,free cash flow, and spending on research and development. Growth investors are less worried about the dividend growth, high price-to-earnings ratios, and high price-to-book ratios that growth companies face\u00a0because the focus is on sales growth and maintaining industry leadership. Overall, growth stocks pay lower dividends thanvalue stocksbecause profits are reinvested in the business to drive\u00a0earnings growth.\n\nDuringbull markets, growth stocks are preferred and tend to outperform value stocks because of environmental risk and the perceived low risk in the markets. However, growth stocks tend to underperform value stocks duringbear marketsbecause\u00a0weak economic activity hinders sales growth and the growth engine that drives\u00a0the stocks higher.\n\nMature companies tend to weather bear markets better than growth companies as they are firmly rooted within their industry, have a dedicated consumer base, are well-known, and have stronger financials, such as larger cash reserves to ride out the poor performing economy.\n\nMature companies also have an easier time raising capital in difficult economic times because of the fact that they are established and their credit is proven; growth companies often have less established financials so obtaining a loan, for example, may be more difficult. This is why growth companies often receive capital fromventure capitalfirms orangel investors. This additional capital can be imperative to helping some growth companies survive an economic downturn.\n\nThe vast majority of growth companies reside in the technology sector\u00a0where rapid innovation and growth spending is typical. Google (GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) are three classic examples of growth companies because they continue to focus on investing in innovative technologies, sales growth, and expansion into new businesses.\n\nWhile these three growth stocks have more expensive valuations than the S&P 500, Google, Tesla, and Amazon are also the leaders in their respective niche industries. Google is continuing its technology conglomerate-status by expanding into new technologies such asartificial intelligence. Tesla is the popular electric car maker and undisputed leader of the industry. Meanwhile, Amazon continues to disrupt the retail sector through itse-commerceplatform, which takes\u00a0away business from traditional brick-and-mortar retail competitors. Those are attractive narratives for investors looking for growth to continue into the future.\n\nThat being said, these three companies are also now fairly established within their industries and are considered solid investments that have very different characteristics from when they started out as small companies years ago. Many growth companies exist in different sectors, one being Etsy (ETSY), the e-commerce retail platform that sells a large array of vintage and craft items.",
