  "definition": "Clay Halton was a Business Editor at Investopedia and has been working in the finance publishing field for more than five years. He also writes and edits personal finance content, with a focus on LGBTQ+ finance.\n\nErika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe misery index measures economic distress felt by everyday people due to the risk of (or actual) joblessness combined with an increasing cost of living. The misery index is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to theinflationrate.\n\nSince unemployment and inflation are considered detrimental to one's economic well-being, their combined value is useful as an indicator of overall economic health. The original misery index was popularized in the 1970s with the development ofstagflation, or simultaneously high inflation and unemployment.\n\nThe misery index has two components: theunemployment rateand theinflationrate. U.S. unemployment is the number of able-bodied adults who are actively looking for work, as a percentage of the total workforce.\n\nInflation refers to the rate at which money losesbuying power, due to the rise of consumer prices. In most cases, these numbers are inversely correlated; when the unemployment rate goes down, prices tend to go up, and vice versa.\n\nThe misery index is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment and the annual inflation rate.\n\nEconomists generally considerfull employmentto mean an unemploymentrate of 4% to 5%. TheFederal Reservetargets an inflation rate of 2%. Therefore, a satisfactory misery index rating would be in the range of 6% to 7%.\n\nThe unemployment rate is adjusted to remove seasonal employment patterns so that it can provide good insight into the relative level of employment.\n\nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is measured as a percentage. It reflects the portion of the workforce that can work and actively seeks employment but can\u2019t find a job. Workers who are retired but working and those who have stopped trying to find a job are excluded from the seasonally adjusted rate.\n\nTheBureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)reports unemployment data each month.\n\nThe annualinflationrate is the percentage increase in the prices of the goods and services consumed by the buyers. In short, it measures the prices of all goods and services existing in the economy.\n\nThe BLS reports inflation data each month in itsconsumer price index (CPI)release.\n\nThe misery index as of December 2024. This figure is derived by adding the unemployment rate (4.1) and the inflation rate (2.89).\n\nThe first misery index was created by economistArthur Okunin the 1970s when he was a scholar at the Brookings Institution. He had previously served on President Lyndon Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nOkun combined the nation\u2019s annual inflation rate and unemployment rate to provide an easily understood snapshot of the economy\u2019s relative health. The higher the index, the greater the misery felt by the average citizen.\n\nDuring the 1970s, afterPresident Nixon restricted and then severedthe final links between the U.S. dollar and gold, the U.S. experienced several years of simultaneously elevated price inflation and unemployment, known as stagflation.\n\nThe American people were caught in a squeeze between the hardships of joblessness as the economy hit a series of recessions and a risingcost of livingas the dollar rapidly lost value.\n\nThis phenomenon did not fit with dominant macroeconomic theories at the time, based on thePhillips curve. It led economists to explore alternative ideas to describe and explain what was going on.\n\nAt the time, the misery index was novel because mainstream economists had previously believed that inflation and unemployment would offset one another rather than rise at the same time.\n\nDuring the 1976 campaign for U.S. president, candidate Jimmy Carter popularized Okun\u2019s misery index as a means of criticizing his opponent, incumbent Gerald Ford. By the end of Ford administration, the misery index was a relatively high 12.7%.\n\nDuring the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan in turn pointed out that the misery index increased under Carter.\n\nWhile it is a convenient shorthand for economic misfortune, the misery index should not be considered a precise metric for economic health.\n\nFor one thing, both components of the misery index have inherent blind spots. The unemployment rate only counts the unemployed who are actively looking for work. It does not include those who have given up looking for work, as might be the case for long-term stretches of unemployment.\n\nLikewise, low inflation can also be accompanied by unexpected misery. For example, no inflation, or evendeflation, can be signs of a stagnant economy, which can be a hardship for many due to the potential for rising unemployment and falling equity and real estate valuations. However, the low rates would produce a very low misery index.\n\nIn addition, the misery index treats unemployment and inflation equally. However, a 1% increase in unemployment likely causes more misery than a 1% increase in inflation.\n\nThe Okun misery index is considered a convenient but highly imprecise metric, due to the inherent flaws of inflation and unemployment as measurements of economic health.\n\nThe Okun misery index has faced some criticism from economists.\n\nThere have been several attempts to modernize the misery index by including other metrics.\n\nThe misery index has been modified several times, first by Harvard economist Robert Barro. In 1999, Barro created the Barro misery index, which adds consumer lendinginterest ratesand the gap between actual and potentialgross domestic product (GDP)growth to evaluate post-WWII presidents.\n\nIn 2011, Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke modified Barro's misery index and broadened its application to be a cross-country index. Hanke's annual misery index is the sum of unemployment, inflation, and bank lending rates, minus the change in realGDP per capita.\n\nHanke publishes his global list of misery index rankings annually for the countries that report relevant data on a timely basis. For 2021, his list included 156 nations, with Libya being identified as the world\u2019s least miserable country and Cuba as the world's most miserable country.\n\nThe concept of a misery index has also been expanded toasset classes. For example, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Advisors, created theBitcoin Misery Index (BMI)to measure the average bitcoin investor's misery. The index calculates the percentage of winning trades against total trades and adds it to the cryptocurrency's overall volatility. The index is considered \"at misery\" when its total value is less than 27.\n\nA variation of the original misery index is the Bloomberg misery index. Argentina, South Africa, and Venezuela, countries beset by widespread inflation and unemployment, topped the index in 2020.\n\nOn the other end, Thailand, Singapore, and Japan were considered the happiest countries according to economist estimates.\n\nBut low inflation and low unemployment rates can also mask low demand. Japan is a textbook case of persistently low demand due to an economy that has suffered from stagflation for the last two decades.\n\nIt's smart for investors to build anemergency fundin case of an economic downturn or job loss.\n\nAlthough the misery index was first popularized in the 1970s, it is possible to evaluate the economic misfortunes under different presidents by comparing their inflation and unemployment figures.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most miserable year on record occurred during theGreat Depression. The misery index reached 25.7% in the first year of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (1933). It fell to 3.5% by 1944, likely due to full employment during the Second World War.\n\nRichard Nixon (1969 to 1974) and Jimmy Carter (1977 to 1980) have the unenviable distinction of presiding over the most miserable economies of the post-war period. The misery index rose to 20% under Nixon and 22% under Carter. The index fell sharply under Ronald Reagan, and it continued to trend downwards during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton presidencies.\n\nDuring the presidency of George W. Bush, the misery index again trended upwards. It reached a peak of 12.7% under President Obama due to the ongoingGreat Recession. The index fell to a low of 5.06% in 2015 and remained low through most of the Trump presidency (2017 to 2020). However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp increase in unemployment, pushing the misery index to 15%.\n\nSource: United States Misery Index\n\nThe U.S. misery index reading was 6.99 (unemployment rate of 4.1 + Inflation rate of 6.89), as of December 2024.\n\nThe misery index was created by economist Arthur Okun in the 1970s and it was initially called the Economic Discomfort Index.\n\nThe world's most miserable country is Argentina, according to World Population Review. The country had a misery index of 321.8 as of 2023. It was followed by Venezuela (276.3), Lebanon (266.1), Syria (251.4), and Zimbabwe (242.2).\n\nThe misery index, created by economist Arthur Okun, is an economic indicator that is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment and the annual inflation rate. Broadly speaking, it serves as a measure of the nation's economic health and the economic distress of the average citizen.\n\nWhile the misery index became a popular measure due to its simplicity, it is widely regarded as an ineffective measure of macroeconomic conditions since it doesn't consider economic growth data.\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. \"Employment Situation.\"\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics. \"Consumer Price Index.\"\n\nU.S. Misery Index. \"United States Misery Index - How miserable do you feel?\"\n\nBrookings Institution. \"The Brooking Institution's Arthur Okun - Father of the 'Misery Index'.\"\n\nBloomberg. \"Reagan Vs.
