  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nPassive activity loss rules are tax regulations that limit a taxpayer's ability to use losses from passive activities to offset earned or ordinary income. Being materially involved with earned or ordinary income-producing activities means the income isactive incomeand may not be reduced by passive losses. Instead,passive lossescan only be used to offset passive income.\n\nThe key issue with passive activity loss rules ismaterial participation. According to\u00a0IRS Topic No. 425, \"material participation\" is involvement in the operation of a trade or business\u00a0activity\u00a0on\u00a0a \"regular,\u00a0continuous, and substantial basis.\"\n\nThere are seven tests that can define material participation, but the most common one is working at least 500 hours in the business in the course of a year.If the taxpayer does not materially participate in the activity that is producing the passive losses, those losses can be matched\u00a0only against passive income. If there is no passive income, no loss can be deducted.\n\nNote that rental activities\u2014including real estate rental activities\u2014are considered passive activities even if there is material participation. (Real estate professionals have their own rules for determining material participation.)\n\nPassive income is different from portfolio income.Portfolio incomeincludes capital gains, dividends, and interest.\n\nPassive activity losses aretax attributesthat can only be applied in the current year in most cases. However, if they exceed passive income they can be\u00a0carried forward without limitation. They cannot be carried back.\n\nPassive activity loss rules are generally applied at the individual level, but they also extend to virtually all businesses and rental activity in various reporting entities, with the exception of C corporations. These are designed to deter the abusive use of tax shelters.\n\nThere are detailed rules about how much passive loss is deductible.If you think these rules could apply to your tax situation, consult a tax specialist.\n\nPassive activity is activity that a taxpayer did not materially participate in during the tax year. TheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)defines two types of passive activity:\n\nUnless the taxpayer is areal estateprofessional, rental activities usually provide streams of income that are passive. The IRS defines material participation as involvement in the activity of the business on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis.\n\nA passive loss is thus a financial loss within an investment in any trade or business enterprise in which the investor is not a\u00a0material participant. Passive losses can stem from investments in rental properties, businesspartnerships, or other activities in which an investor is not materially involved. In order to be considered a non-material participant, the investor cannot be continuously and substantially active or involved in the business activity.\n\nPassive losses (and income) can come from the following activities, though there may be some exceptions in each category:\n\nIf you are unsure whether a loss should be classified as passive or not, it is worth consulting with a professional accountant to ensure your taxes are being filed correctly.\n\nUnder U.S. tax law, a passive activity is one that produced income or losses that did not involve any material participation by the taxpayer. For example, if you own farmland but rent it out to a farmer who does all the work, you're making passive income.\n\nPassive losses cannot be used to offset earned income. They can only be used to offset other passive income.\n\nYes, passive income is taxable, usually at the same rate as the taxpayer would pay on earned income.If you have passive income, you may be able to offset the taxes due on it withsome deductions.\n\nActive income is earned through producing or helping to produce a product or service. Passive income is received without any substantial effort. Active income and passive income are both taxable, usually at the same rate. However, the difference is important when a taxpayer has losses in passive income. In such cases, the passive activity loss rules forbidtaxpayersfrom using passive losses to reduce active or earned income.\n\nPassive income, while taxable, operates under different rules than active income when it comes to deductions. Although passive income is taxed the same way as active income, the critical difference lies in the treatment of passive losses. If you incur losses from passive income, you cannot use those losses to offset gains from active income sources, as passive losses can only offset passive income.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 8582, Passive Activity Loss Limitations.\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 425, Passive Activities -- Losses and Credits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Page 5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Pages 5-6.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Page 7.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Page 2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Pages 6-8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Page 3.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Pages 3, 5-6.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Pages 3-4.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 925, Passive Activity and At-Risk Rules.\" Pages 2-4, 6, 12.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Schedule F Profit and Loss From Farming.\" Page 2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 4835, Farm Rental Income and Expenses.\" Page 2.\n\nCMP. \"Passive Income Tax: Guide to Taxation for Your Passive Income Streams.\"",
