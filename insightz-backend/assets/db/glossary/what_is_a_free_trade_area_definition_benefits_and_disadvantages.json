  "term": "What Is a Free Trade Area? Definition, Benefits, and Disadvantages",
  "definition": "A free trade area is a region in which several countries sign a free trade agreement and maintain little to no barriers to trade in the form of tariffs or quotas among one another. Free trade areas facilitate international trade and any associated gains along with the international division of labor and specialization. These deals are highly criticized by some for costs associated with increasing economic integration and artificially restraining free trade.\n\nContrary to what it sounds like, a free trade area isn't necessarily a physical location. Rather, it is an agreement between a group of countries that put up few or no barriers to trade in the form of tariffs or quotas among them. Free trade areas tend to increase the volume of international trade among member countries and allow them to increase theircomparative advantages.\n\nTo develop a free trade area, participating nations must set rules for how it will operate. They must address the following questions:\n\nHow these questions are answered in a specific free trade agreement tends to be based on political influences within and power relations among countries. This shapes the degree of how \"free\" the trade is and its scope. The goal is to create a trade policy upon which all participating countries can feasibly agree and benefit.\n\nThe benefits of free trade areas include providing consumers with increased access to higher-quality foreign goods and lower prices as governments reduce or eliminate tariffs. Producers can acquire a greatly expanded market of potential customers or suppliers.\n\nFree trade areas can also encourage economic development in countries as a whole, benefiting some of the population through increased living standards.\n\nFree trade is favored by some advocates of free market economics because they say it improves efficiency and innovation by encouraging competition. They also suggest that it promotes fairness in the markets and economy by eliminating monopolies that can hurt consumers. This lowers the barriers to entry for new competitors.\n\nThe history of international trade agreements is long, but the general acceptance of free trade agreements dates to the Bretton Woods Conference in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nCritics argue that free trade areas can hurt the economies of participating countries and, to some extent, the global economy. For instance, certain workers may lose jobs and face related hardships as production moves to areas where comparative advantage or home market effects make those industries less costly and more efficient overall.\n\nSome investments in fixed physical and human capital will end up losing value or as entirelysunk costs. Producers may struggle with increased competition. This can lead to a deterioration of workplace environments, especially if companies look for cheap labor by outsourcing jobs in developing nations.\n\nOther drawbacks include making an economy too dependent on just a few products, preventing the growth of infant industries that need economic protection, endangering security if a country becomes too dependent on imports of vital resources, and forcing countries to lower environmental standards to compete.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was highly critical and moved the country away from free trade agreements during his first term, instituting tariffs as a form of economic warfare. Former president Joe Biden and his administration did not rescind Trump's tariffs despite calls to do so.\n\nThe United States participates in 14 free trade areas with 20 countries.One of the best-known and largest free trade areas, theNorth American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), was created on Jan. 1, 1994. This agreement, signed by Canada, the United States, and Mexico, encouraged trade among these American countries.\n\nThese three countries replaced NAFTA with theUnited States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)in 2018.\u00a0It went into effect on July 1, 2020.The U.S. also participates in theCentral American Free Trade Area-Dominican Republic (CAFTA-DR), which includes the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras, and Guatemala.Individual agreements are in place between the U.S. and Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Peru, Singapore, Israel, Jordan, Korea, Oman, and Morocco.\n\nThe U.S. began negotiations in March 2010 for theTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)to create a \u201chigh-standard, broad-based regional pact\u201d for a regional Asia-Pacific trade agreement. However, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the agreement on Jan. 30, 2017\u2014one of his first official acts. The agreement proceeded without the U.S. as a participant.\n\nTheTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP)was intended as a companion to TPP by creating an agreement with the European Union (EU).The agreement fell through in 2016 after Greenpeace leaked 248 classified pages from the negotiations.Although no free trade agreement exists between the EU and the U.S., a reduction of tariffs in August 2020 was announced to \u201cincrease market access for hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. and EU exports.\u201d\n\nA free trade area is an agreement formed by a group of like-minded countries that agree to reduce trade barriers, such as tariffs and quotas. It encourages international trade among the member countries.\n\nThe United States-Mexico-Canada Free Trade Agreement is an example of a free trade area.\n\nA free trade zone is a location where goods can be purchased and shipped across borders without customs agency involvement, usually under a trade agreement between countries.\n\nA free trade area is an agreement among nations to reduce or eliminate trade barriers such as quotas or tariffs. There are potential advantages and disadvantages for a member nation, including improved access to high-quality, low-priced goods and increased economic development on the plus side and job migration out of a country as well as developing a dependence on two few goods on the downside. The U.S. currently participates in 14 free-trade areas with 20 different countries.\n\nGeorge Mason University Mercatus Center. \"The Benefits of Free Trade: Addressing Key Myths.\" Link downloads a PDF.\n\nU.S. Department of State: Office of the Historian. \"Bretton Woods-GATT, 1941\u20131947.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"Tariffs and Trade.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Free Trade Agreements.\"\n\nFederal Register. \"North American Free Trade Agreement.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"CAFTA-DR (Dominican Republic-Central America FTA).\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Letter to Trans-Pacific Partnership Depositary.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (T-TIP).\"\n\nGreenpeace. \"#TTIPleaks: Confidential TTIP Papers Unveil US Position.\"\n\nGreenpeace. \"TTIP Leaks (2 May 2016).\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Joint Statement of the United States and the European Union on a Tariff Agreement.\"",
