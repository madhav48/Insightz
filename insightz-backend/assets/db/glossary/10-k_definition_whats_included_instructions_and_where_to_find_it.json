  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nForm 10-K is a required annual filing where a company details its financial situation and circumstances for the prior year.\n\nForm 10-K is an annual financial report that publicly-traded companies must file with theU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Some of the data required in a 10-K includes the company's history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and other relevant data.\n\nBecause of the depth and nature of the information they contain,10-Ksare fairly long and tend to be complicated. Butinvestorsneed to understand that this is one of the most comprehensive and most important documents a public company can publish on a yearly basis. The more information they can gather from the 10-K, the more they can understand the company. Canadian companies will fileSEC Form 40-Fto provide this information.\n\nThe government requires companies to publish 10-K forms so investors have accurate information and can make informed investment decisions.\u00a0This form gives a clearer picture of everything a company does and what kinds of risks it faces.\n\nMost companies publish their 10-Ks and other required filings on the Investor Relations section of their website. You can also find them using the company search function through the SEC's EDGAR database.\n\nThe 10-K includes five distinct sections:\n\nA 10-K filing also includes signed letters from the company\u2019s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. In it, the executives swear under oath that the information included in the 10-K is accurate.These letters became required after several high-profile accounting fraud cases followed the dot-com bust.\n\n10-K filings are public information and readily available through a number of sources. In fact, the vast majority of companies include them in theInvestor Relationssection of their website. The information included in a 10-K can be difficult to move through, but the more familiar investors become with the layout and the type of information included, the easier it is to identify the most important details.\n\nFiling deadlines for the 10-K vary based on the size of the company. According to the SEC, companies with a publicfloat\u2014shares issued to the public that are available to trade\u2014of $700 million or more must file their 10-K within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year. Companies with a float between $75 million and $700 million have 75 days, while companies with less than $75 million in their float have 90 days.\n\nThe primary purpose of filing a Form 10-K is to provide comprehensive, transparent information about how a company is doing. Because this information is useful to a variety of people, the SEC requires certain information to be presented in a certain way. At a very high level, it\u2019s fair to say Form 10-K\u2019s purpose can be broken down into the following five categories (which slightly overlap but are more high-level than the five categories listed above):\n\nForm 10-K is prescribed by the 1934 Securities Exchange Act.\n\nForm 10-K is required to be filed by allpublicly traded companiesin the United States. This requirement applies to companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange.The SEC imposes this filing requirement to ensure transparency and accountability in the financial markets, allowing investors and other stakeholders to access relevant information about the company's operations, financial condition, and performance.\n\nThe filing of Form 10-K is not limited tolarge corporations; it applies to companies of all sizes that meet the criteria for being publicly traded. This includes both domestic and foreign companies whose securities are listed on U.S. exchanges or are registered with the SEC. Additionally, certain smaller reporting companies may file a streamlined version of the Form 10-K, known as Form 10-KSB or Form 10-KT.Note that in order to file this alternative version, a company has to meet some eligibility requirements.\n\nForm 10-K is only used for U.S. companies trading on U.S. exchanges. If a foreign company lists its shares on a U.S. exchange, it filesForm 20-F.\n\nThere are penalties for not filing a Form 10-K on time. These penalties can vary depending on the severity of the violation and the circumstances surrounding the late filing. In most cases, companies pay a fee for non-compliance.\n\nFailure to file required periodic reports can result in the loss of good standing with stock exchanges and other regulatory bodies. This could lead to delisting from stock exchanges or temporary suspensions of 10trading days.In addition, the SEC may take legal and regulatory actions against companies that repeatedly fail to meet filing deadlines or comply with disclosure requirements. These actions can include enforcement proceedings, investigations, fines, and sanctions against the company, its officers, directors, or other responsible parties.\n\nOn the softer side of the consequences, late or incomplete filings can erode investor confidence and trust in the company's management. Investors may perceive delayed filings as a red flag indicating potential financial problems, lack of transparency, or poor internal controls. There\u2019s little reason for a Form 10-K to be filed late, and investors may (and probably should) be curious about the reasons behind any non-compliance.\n\nWhile Form 10-K reports a wealth of useful information, it does have its downsides. These limitations include but aren\u2019t necessarily limited to:\n\nAlong with the 10-K, the SEC requires that public companies regularly file forms 10-Q and 8-K.\n\nForm 10-Q must be submitted to theSECon a quarterly basis. This form is a comprehensive report of a company's performance and includes relevant information about its financial position. Unlike the 10-K, the information in the 10-Q is usually unaudited. The company is only required to file it three times a year as the 10-K is filed in the fourth quarter.\n\nForm 8-K is required by the SEC whenever companies announce major events that shareholders should be aware of. These events may include (but aren't limited to) sales, acquisitions, delistings, departures, and elections of executives, as well as changes in a company's status or control, bankruptcies, information about operations, assets, and any other relevant news.\n\nThe Form 10-K and theannual reportserve distinct purposes and cater to different audiences. The Form 10-K is a regulatory filing mandated by the SEC. On the other hand, the annual report represents a broader communication tool utilized by companies to engage with a wider range of stakeholders. While it often includes Form 10-K as its core financial and regulatory component, the annual report also incorporates additional elements such as narrative descriptions, graphics, photos, and other visually appealing features.\n\nThese elements aim to provide a more reader-friendly and engaging format for shareholders, employees, customers, and other stakeholders. For example, companies may have high-quality photographs or graphic designs as part of the introduction to their annual report. The intention is to make the annual report visually attractive to entice readership; Form 10-K is not meant to look nearly as pretty.\n\nUnlike the Form 10-K, which is subject to specific regulatory requirements and accounting standards, the annual report is not bound by such constraints. Instead, it allows companies greater flexibility in crafting a narrative that aligns with their objectives and corporate identity. Through the annual report, companies seek to showcase their accomplishments,company values, and vision to stakeholders. In many ways, it\u2019s fair to call an annual report a marketing and communication tool, whereas the Form 10-K is much more of a regulatory compliance document.\n\nIf a company wants to sell its stock to the public, it must make certain disclosures and filings so that investors have accurate information and can decide if it's a good investment. One of those filings is SEC Form 10-K, which companies must file every year.\n\nForm 10-K describes the company's business model and possible risk factors. It also describes the company's financial condition, including its debts, liabilities, operational costs, and revenue.\n\nThe company's executives must also make a sworn statement that the information in the 10-K is accurate. If they are wrong, they can face penalties.\n\nForm 10-K is a comprehensive annual report filed by publicly traded companies with the U.S. SEC. It provides a detailed summary of the company's financial performance. This form is required by the SEC to ensure transparency and provide investors with essential information to make informed decisions.\n\nThe due date for Form 10-K depends on the size of the company. Large accelerated filers must file within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year. Other companies with smaller float may file within 75 days or 90 days after their fiscal year.\n\nA company's Form 10-K can be found on the SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) database, which is accessible to the public online. Additionally, companies often provide links to their 10-K filings on their investor relations websites.\n\nReading a Form 10-K involves understanding its structure and the significance of its various sections. Start with the business overview to get a sense of what the company does. Then, review the risk factors to understand potential challenges. Move onto the MD&A for insights into management\u2019s perspective on financial results, then review the actual financial numbers to understand actual company performance.\n\nForm 10-K is an annual comprehensive report filed by publicly traded companies with the SEC, detailing their financial performance and business operations. It includes audited financial statements, management's discussion and analysis, risk factors, and other important disclosures. This document provides investors and stakeholders with crucial information to assess the company's financial health and is required by regulatory bodies.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Using EDGAR to Research Investments.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"How to Read a 10-K.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"How to Read a 10-K/10-Q.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Testimony Concerning Implementation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-K.\"\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. \"NYSE Regulation.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"General Instructions.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-KSB.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"SEC Charges Five Companies for Failure to Disclose Complete Information On Form NT.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Bulletin: Delinquent Filings.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 10-Q.\"\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 8-K.\"",
