  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) is a quasi-governmental entity established to enhance the flow of credit to specific sectors of the U.S.economy. Created by acts of Congress, these agencies\u2014although they are privately held\u2014provide public financial services. GSEs help to facilitate borrowing for a variety of individuals, including students, farmers, and homeowners.\n\nFor example, theFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac)was created as a GSE in the housing sector. It was intended to encourage homeownership among the middle and working classes. Freddie Mac is considered amortgageGSE.\n\nAnother example of mortgage GSEs is theFederal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). This entity was introduced to improve the flow ofcreditin thehousing market(while also reducing the cost of that credit).\n\nGSEs do not lend money to the public directly. Instead, they guaranteethird-party loansand purchaseloansin the secondary market, thereby providing money to lenders and financial institutions.\n\nGSEs also issue short- and long-term bonds, referred to asagency bonds. The degree to which an agency bond issuer is considered independent of the federal government impacts the level of itsdefault risk. Bondinvestorsholding most, but not all, types of agency bonds have theirinterestpayments exempt from state and local taxes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds are not exempt from these taxes.\n\nAlthough GSE bonds carry the implicit backing of the U.S. government, they are not guaranteed by the U.S. government. Unlike Treasury bonds, they are not direct obligations of the government. For this reason, these securities offer a slightly higheryieldthan Treasury bonds, since they have a somewhat higher degree ofcredit riskand default risk.\n\nThe first GSE, theFarm Credit System (FCS), was created in 1916 to serve the farming sector.The FCS still exists as a network of federally chartered, borrower-owned lending institutions. They are tasked with providing an accessible source of credit to farmers, ranchers, and other entities involved in agriculture.\n\nThe FCS receives its funding capital from the Federal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation, which sellsbondson securities markets.Another farming GSE, theFederal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), was created in 1988. It guarantees the timely repayment ofprincipaland interest to agricultural bond investors, purchases loans from lenders, provides financing for lenders and farmland investors, and issues long-term standby purchase commitments.\n\nTo stimulate the housing sector, in 1932, the government established the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system, which is owned by more than 6,500 community financial institutions.Fannie Mae,Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac were chartered later\u2014in 1938, 1968, and 1970, respectively.While similar in some ways, Ginnie Mae is not technically a GSE. The housing GSEs purchase mortgages from lenders on thesecondary mortgage markets. The proceeds from the sale are used bylendersto provide more credit to borrowers or mortgagors.\n\nOne difference between Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae is that Ginnie Mae is owned by the government and part of theU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Therefore, it's not considered a GSE.\n\nSallie Maewas created in 1972 to target the education sector. While the establishment originally serviced and collected federal student loans on behalf of the U.S. Department of Education, it ended its ties to the government in 2004.Sallie Mae now offersstudent loansprivately, along with advice on financing higher education and federal loan programs.\n\nThe aggregate loans of GSEs in the secondary market make them some of the largest financial institutions in the United States. A collapse of even one GSE could lead to a downward spiral in the markets, which could lead to an economic disaster. Since they have an implicit guarantee from the government that they will not be allowed to fail, GSEs are considered by critics to be stealth recipients of corporate welfare.\n\nIn fact, following the 2008subprime mortgage crisis, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac received a combined $187 billion worth of federal assistance.This large sum was intended to mitigate the negative impact that the wave ofdefaultswas wreaking on the housing market and the national economy. They were also placed into government conservatorship. Both agencies have repaid their respectivebailoutssince then, though they remain under the control of theFederal Housing Finance Agency.\n\nA government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) is an entity that Congress created to increase the flow of credit in certain areas of the U.S. economy, particularly real estate. GSEs differ from government agencies. The main difference is that GSEs are privately held organizations, while government agencies are run directly by the federal government.\n\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), and the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) system are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the housing finance market. Sallie Mae (SLM) was a student loan GSE that is now a regular, private corporation. And the Farm Credit System (FCS) and the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corp. (Farmer Mac) are agricultural GSEs.\n\nYes. Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored enterprise in the housing finance market. As a housing GSE, Freddie Mac is a \u201cfederally chartered, shareholder-owned, private company with a public mission to provide stability in and increase the liquidity of the residential mortgage market\u201d.Freddie Mac also helps increase the availability of mortgage credit to low- and moderate-income families and in underserved areas.\n\nCongress created government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to increase stability and liquidity in certain areas of the U.S. economy, particularly real estate. GSEs do not loan money to consumers. Rather, they guarantee certain loan products, making financing more widely available, especially for consumers who may not otherwise qualify.\n\nCorrection\u2014May 29, 2023:The latest version of this article has removed Ginnie Mae as an example of GSE.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \"A Brief History of the Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises.\" Pages 3-4.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \"A Brief History of the Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises.\" Page 2.\n\nCharles Schwab. \"U.S. Agency Bonds: What You Should Know.\"\n\nFarm Credit Administration. \u201cHistory of FCA.\u201d\n\nFederal Farm Credit Banks Funding Corporation. \u201cAbout Us.\u201d\n\nFarm Credit Administration. \u201cAbout Farmer Mac.\u201d\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \u201cFederal Home Loan Bank Membership Data.\u201d\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \"A Brief History of the Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises.\" Page 1.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \u201cA Brief History of the Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises.\u201d Pages 2\u20133.\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \"A Brief History of the Housing Government-Sponsored Enterprises.\" Page 3.\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"Treasury Announces Successful Privatization of Sallie Mae.\"\n\nCongressional Budget Office. \"Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Future of the Secondary Mortgage Market.\"\n\nFederal Housing Finance Agency. \u201cConservatorship.\u201d\n\nThe White House. \u201cGovernment-Sponsored Enterprises.\u201d Page 1378.",
