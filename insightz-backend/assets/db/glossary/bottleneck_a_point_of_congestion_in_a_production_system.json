  "term": "Bottleneck: A Point of Congestion in a Production System",
  "definition": "A bottleneck is a point of congestion in a production system (such as an assembly line or a computer network) that stops or severely slows the system. The inefficiencies brought about by the bottleneck often create delays and higherproduction costs.\n\nThe term \u201cbottleneck\u201d refers to the typical shape of a bottle and the fact that the bottle\u2019s neck is the narrowest point, which is the most likely place for congestion to occur, slowing down the flow of liquid from the bottle.\n\nThere are two main types of bottlenecks: short-term and long-term. A short-term bottleneck is temporary and typically caused by temporary conditions such as employees on vacation or on sick leave. Long-term bottlenecks are baked into the production process and include such things as inefficient machinery.\n\nBottlenecking, the process that creates bottlenecks, can have a significant impact on the flow ofmanufacturingand can sharply increase the time and expense of production. Companies are more at risk for bottlenecks when they start the production process for a new product. This is because there may be flaws in the process that the company must identify and correct; this situation requires more scrutiny and fine-tuning.Operations managementis concerned with controlling the production process, identifying potential bottlenecks before they occur, and finding efficient solutions.\n\nAs an example, assume that a furniture manufacturer moves wood, metal, and otherraw materialsinto production, then incurs labor and machine costs to produce and assemble furniture. When production is complete, the finished goods are stored in inventory. The inventory cost is often transferred to thecost of goods sold (COGS)when the furniture is sold to a customer.\n\nIf there is abottleneckat the beginning of production, the furniture maker cannot move enough raw materials into the process, which means that machines sit idle and paid workers don\u2019t work productively, creating a situation of underutilization of resources. This increases the cost of production, presents a potentially largeopportunity cost, and may mean that completed goods do not ship to customers on time.\n\nTraffic congestion on roads and highways is often caused by bottlenecks that restrict vehicle flow. This can be due to poor planning, roadwork, or an accident that closes one or more lanes.\n\nA bottleneck affects the level of productioncapacitythat a firm can achieve each month. Theoretical capacity assumes that a company can produce at maximum capacity at all times. This concept assumes no machine breakdowns, bathroom breaks, or employee vacations.\n\nBecause theoretical capacity is not realistic, most businesses use practical capacity to manage production. This level of capacity assumes downtime for machine repairs and employee time off. Practical capacity provides a range for which different processes can operate efficiently without breaking down. Go above the optimum range, and the risk increases for a bottleneck due to a breakdown of one or more processes.\n\nIf a company finds that its production capacity is inadequate to meet its production goals, it has several options. Company management could decide to lower their production goals to bring them in line with their production capacity. Or, they could work to find solutions that simultaneously prevent bottlenecks and increase production. Companies often usecapacity requirements planning (CRP)tools and methods to determine and meet production goals.\n\nAvariance in the production processis the difference between budgeted and actual results. Managers analyze variances to make changes, including changes to remove bottlenecks. If actual labor costs are much higher than budgeted amounts, the manager may determine that a bottleneck is delaying production and wasting labor hours. If management can remove the bottleneck, labor costs can be reduced.\n\nA bottleneck can also cause a material variance if materials are exposed to spoilage or possible damage as they sit on the factory floor waiting to be used in production. Bottlenecks may be resolved by increasingcapacity utilization, finding new suppliers, automating labor processes, and creating better forecasts for consumer demand.\n\nBottlenecks may also arise when demand spikes unexpectedly and exceeds the production capacity of a firm\u2019s factories or suppliers. For instance, whenTesla Inc.(TSLA) first began production of its all-electric vehicles, demand was high for the vehicles, and some analysts were concerned that production would be slowed due to problems in the production line. In fact, Tesla has experienced ongoing production bottlenecks due to the need to manufacture the custom battery packs that supply their vehicles with power.\n\nTesla founderElon Muskhas said the company\u2019s ability to expand its product lineup depends squarely on its ability to produce a large number of batteries. To make that happen, in a joint venture with Panasonic, Tesla opened a massiveGigafactorynear Reno, Nev., in 2016, which makes the company\u2019s lithium ion batteries and electric vehicle subassemblies. By 2023, the company claimed that its factory was producing more than 37 gigawatt-hours(GWh) of storage capacity every year, making it the largest battery plant in the world in terms of production capacity.To make a dent in the waiting list for back-ordered vehicles, Tesla says it will need to continue to invest in and build more Gigafactories worldwide.\n\nA bottleneck occurs when there is not enough capacity to meet the demand orthroughputfor a product or service. It is called a bottleneck since the neck of a bottle narrows and tapers, restricting the amount of liquid that can flow out of a bottle at once.\n\nA bottleneck occurs in manufacturing when there is a stage (or stages) in the process that slows down the overall production of a good. For instance, initial steps may rapidly assemble key parts, but a crucial next step that welds the parts together may not be able to keep pace with the earlier stages. As a result, a backlog occurs and efficiency is reduced. The bottleneck should be solved by expanding that process, investing in better technology to speed up that process, or hiring more workers to help with that process.\n\nMany services are carried out by human beings who have a natural limit on how fast or efficiently they can work. For instance, a barber may only be able to cut the hair of three individuals per hour. If more people want a haircut, they will have to wait, and this can cause a backlog. Ways to reduce a bottleneck are to hire additional barbers, or to increase the efficiency of the barber using technology or skills training (so that they can accommodate four customers per hour).\n\nA bottleneck is a point of congestion in a production system that slows or stops progress. Short-term bottlenecks are temporary and often caused by a labor shortage. Long-term bottlenecks are more incorporated into the system itself and characterized by inefficient machinery or processes.\n\nSince bottlenecking is counterproductive and leads to a reduction in production efficiency, eliminating bottlenecks is key to increasing profitability. The best way to eliminate bottlenecks is to increase system capacity by restructuring the process or investing in people and machinery.\n\nTesla. \"Continuing Our Investment in Nevada.\"",
