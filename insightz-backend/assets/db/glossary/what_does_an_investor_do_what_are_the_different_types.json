  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nAn investor is any person or other entity (such as a firm ormutual fund) who commits capital with the expectation of receiving financial returns. Investors rely on different financial instruments to earn arate of returnand accomplish important financial objectives like building retirement savings, funding a college education, or merely accumulating additional wealth over time.\n\nAwide varietyof investment vehicles exist to accomplish goals, including (but not limited to) stocks, bonds, commodities, mutual funds,exchange-traded funds(ETFs), options, futures, foreign exchange, gold, silver, retirement plans, and real estate. Investors can analyze opportunities from different angles, and generally prefer to minimize risk while maximizing returns.\n\nInvestors typically generate returns by deploying capital as either equity or debt investments. Equity investments entail ownership stakes in the form of company stock that may pay dividends in addition to generating capital gains.Debt investmentsmay be as loans extended to other individuals or firms, or in the form of purchasing bonds issued by governments or corporations which pay interest in the form of coupons.\n\nInvestors are not a uniform bunch. They have varyingrisk tolerances, capital, styles, preferences, and time frames. For instance, some investors may prefer very low-risk investments that will lead to conservative gains, such as certificates of deposits and certain bond products.\n\nOther investors, however, are more inclined to take on additional risk in an attempt to make a larger profit. These investors might invest in currencies, emerging markets, or stocks, all while dealing with aroller coasterof different factors on a daily basis.\n\nInstitutional investors are organizations such as financial firms or mutual funds that build sizableportfoliosin stocks and other financial instruments. Often, they are able to accumulate and pool money from several smaller investors (individuals and/or firms) in order to make larger investments. Because of this, institutional investors often have far greater market power and influence over the markets than individual retail investors.\n\nInvestors may also adopt various market strategies.Passive investorstend to buy and hold the components of various market indexes and may optimize their allocation weights to certain asset classes based on rules such asModern Portfolio Theory's(MPT) mean-variance optimization. Others may be stock pickers who invest based on fundamental analysis of corporate financial statements and financial ratios\u2014these are active investors.\n\nOne example of anactive approachwould be the \"value\" investors who seek to purchase stocks with low share prices relative to their book values. Others may seek to invest long-term in \"growth\" stocks that may be losing money at the moment but are growing rapidly and hold promise for the future.\n\nPassive (indexed) investing overtook active investment strategies in 2023 as the dominant stock market logic.The growth of low-cost target-date mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, androbo-advisorsis partly responsible for this surge in popularity.\n\nThose interested in learning more about investing, passive and active investors, and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the best investing courses currently available.\n\nFinancial investments have the very specific goal of buying something that (hopefully) appreciates in value. Consider other forms of investing such as returning to school to complete your degree or embarking on a diet to ensure good health in the future.\n\nAnangel investoris a high-net-worth private individual who provides financial capital to a startup or entrepreneur. The capital is often provided in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Angel investors can provide a financial injection either once or on an ongoing basis. An angel investor typically provides capital in the early stages of a new business, when risk is high. They often use excess cash on hand to allocate towards high-risk investments.\n\nVenture capitalistsare private equity investors, usually in the form of a company, that seek to invest in startups and other small businesses. Unlike angel investors, they typically do not seek to fund startup businesses to help get them off the ground, but rather look at businesses that are already in the early stages with a potential for growth. These are companies often looking to expand but not having the means to do so. Venture capitalists seek an equity stake in return for their investment, help nurture the growth of the company, and then sell their stake for a profit.\n\nP2P lending, or peer-to-peer lending, is a form of financing where loans are obtained from other individuals, cutting out the traditional middleman, such as a bank. Examples ofP2P lendinginclude crowdfunding, where businesses seek to raise capital from many investors online in exchange for products or other benefits.\n\nA personal investor can be any individual investing on their own and may take many forms. A personal investor invests their own capital, usually in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Personal investors are not professional investors but rather those seeking higher returns than simple investment vehicles, like certificates of deposit or savings accounts.\n\nInstitutional investorsare organizations that invest the money of other people. Examples of institutional investors are mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, hedge funds, and pension funds. Because institutional investors raise large amounts of capital from many investors, they are able to purchase large amounts of assets, usually big blocks of stocks. In many ways, institutional investors can influence the price of assets. Institutional investors are large and sophisticated.\n\nAn investor istypically distinctfrom a trader. An investor puts capital to use for long-term gain, while a trader seeks to generate short-term profits by buying and selling securities over and over again.\n\nInvestors typically hold positions for years to decades (also called a \"position trader\" or \"buy and hold investor\") while traders generally hold positions for shorter periods. Scalp traders, for example, hold positions for as little as a few seconds.Swing traders, on the other hand, seek positions that are held from several days to several weeks.\n\nInvestors and traders also focus on different types of analysis. Traders typically focus on the technical factors of a stock, known astechnical analysis. A trader is concerned with what direction a stock will move in and how to take advantage of that movement. They are not as concerned about whether the value moves up or down.\n\nInvestors, on the other hand, are more concerned with the long-term prospects of a company, often focusing on itsfundamental values. They make investment decisions based on the likelihood of appreciation of a stock's share price.\n\nOne of the absolute easiest ways to become an investor is to sign up for your company's 401(k) plan.\n\nMany individuals naturally become investors, especially considering those that prioritize long-term savings and putting money away for retirement. Begin by learning the basics of investing such as the various types of assets (e.g. stocks, bonds, real estate), investment strategies (e.g. value investing, growth investing), and risk management. Early in your investing career, be mindful of your risk tolerance. Though greater returns are often had by taking on greater risk, there is also greater downside or loss of original capital.\n\nTo invest in stocks, bonds, and other securities, you'll need to open a brokerage account with a reputable broker. To invest in real estate or physical property, you'll want to be well-versed in local real estate law. Other specific assets will have specific requirements as well, such as a digital wallet for cryptocurrency or physical protection for bullion or tangible precious metals.\n\nBecause investing is much different from trading, it's critical to determine your investment goals, such as your target return and time horizon. This will help you choose the right investments (such as atarget date fund) and make informed decisions. For example, if your goal is to invest money for retirement, you likely have a much longer horizon compared with an investment goal to purchase a new car in several years. Depending on what you are trying to achieve, you will want to frame your investing strategy around your long-term target.\n\nLast, it is important to keep up with market trends and news that may impact your investments. This can help you make informed decisions and adjust your strategy as needed. Depending on your holdings, this may be related to financial, political, international, or social news that may have a ripple effect on the valuation of what you own.\n\nThe basic philosophy of investing is simple: A person contributes capital towards an asset with the expectation that the value of that asset will be higher when it comes time to sell or liquidate the asset. For this reason, an investor can literally invest in anything that may appreciate in value. This is evident by the lucrative deals seen by investors buying and selling tiny rectangles of cardboard (i.e. baseball cards). A more comprehensive list of traditional or common things investors invest in is below:\n\nThe three types of investors in a business are pre-investors, passive investors, and active investors. Pre-investors are those that are not professional investors. These include friends and family that are able to commit a small amount of capital towards your business. Passive investors are those that are professional investors that commit capital but do not play an active role in managing the business. An example would be angel investors. Active investors are those that commit capital but are also actively involved in the business. They make decisions on strategy, senior management, and more. Examples include venture capitalists and private equity firms.\n\nInvestors make money in two ways: appreciation and income. Appreciation occurs when an asset increases in value. An investor purchases an asset in the hopes that its value will grow and they can then sell it for more than they bought it for, earning a profit. Income is the regular payment of funds from the purchase of an asset. For example, a bond pays fixed payments at regular intervals.\n\nTo be a successful investor, a certain set of skills are required. These include diligence, patience, acquisition of knowledge, risk management, discipline, optimism, and the setting of goals.\n\nAn investor is an individual or entity that utilizes its capital or the capital of others with the goal of receiving a return. Investors can range from a person buying stocks at home on their online brokerage account tomulti-billion dollar funds investing globally. The end objective is always the same, to seek some return (profit) in order to build wealth.\n\nInvestors commit their capital to a wide variety of investment vehicles, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds, hedge funds, businesses, and commodities. Investors encounter risk when they commit capital, and walk a balance between managing risk and return.\n\nMorningstar. \u201cIt\u2019s Official: Passive Funds Overtake Active Funds.\u201d",
