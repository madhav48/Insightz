  "term": "Quitclaim Deed: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nA quitclaim deed is a legal document that transfers a person\u2019s interest in apropertyto another party. However, it does so without specifying the nature of the person's ownership or rights in the property and provides no guarantees regarding the validity of those rights.\n\nEssentially, a quitclaim deed releases the grantor (the person transferring the property interest) from any future claims of ownership over the property. It does not promise that thegrantorhas valid ownership; it only promises that they will relinquish any claim they might have. This means that if the grantor has no ownership, the recipient (grantee) gets nothing.\n\nA quitclaim deed usually includes a legal description of the property, the name of the person transferring their interest, the name of the person receiving that interest (thegrantee), the date, and both parties\u2019notarized signatures.\n\nQuitclaim deeds are typically used to transfer property in non-sale situations, such astransfers of propertybetween family members. They can be used to add a spouse to a property title after marriage, remove a spouse from a title after divorce, clarify ownership of inherited property, transfer property into (or out of) a revocableliving trust, clarify aneasement, or change how a property\u2019s title is held.\n\nA quitclaim deed does not assure that the grantor has an ownership interest in a property; it merely states that if the grantor does, they release those ownership rights. As a result, when accepting a quitclaim deed, the buyer accepts the risk that the deed's grantor may not have a valid ownership interest and/or that there may be additional ownership interests in the property.Title insuranceis not issued in conjunction with a quitclaim deed.\n\nDeedsare usually differentiated by what they state or guarantee when the ownership is transferred from the grantor to the grantee (buyer). Unlike a quitclaim deed, awarranty deedcan grant a certain level of assurance when ownership is transferred. Warranty deeds are typically used in property sales and are granted in two common forms: general warranty deeds and special warranty deeds.\n\nA general warranty deed provides the grantee with the highest form of protection because it assures that the grantor owns the property free and clear (and that no other entity can place a claim on it). This guarantee covers the entire history of the property\u2014even times when the grantor did not own the property. If there are any breaches in this contract, the grantor is held responsible.\n\nAspecial warranty deedconveys that the grantor owns the property and that no one else has a claim to it for as long as they have owned it. Special warranty deeds are most commonly used during commercial real estate sales.\n\nA quitclaim deed is a document in which a grantor disclaims all interest in a parcel ofreal propertyand then conveys that interest to a grantee. Unlike grantors in other types of deeds, the quitclaim grantor does not promise that their interest in the property is actually valid.\n\nQuitclaim deeds lack certain protections and promises found in other types of deeds to real property. Because of this, they should only be used under certain circumstances. These include transferring real estate between close family members\u2014for example,from a parent to a child.\n\nA quitclaim deed can generally be canceled if both parties involved (grantor and grantee) agree to reverse the transfer. In cases where a quitclaim deed was used improperly or fraudulently, the deed may be challenged in court.\n\nA quitclaim deed is a simple tool for transferring interest in a property without guaranteeing that the grantor has valid ownership. It\u2019s most commonly used in non-sale situations, such as transfers between family members, or to update or clarify ownership titles. However, because it offers no warranties or guarantees, it carries risk for the grantee. Quitclaim deeds should be used cautiously and under appropriate circumstances.",
