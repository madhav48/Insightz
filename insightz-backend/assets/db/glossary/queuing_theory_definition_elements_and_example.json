Queuing theory examines every component of waiting in line, including the arrival process and the number ofcustomersamong others, which might be people, data packets, cars, or anything else.\n\nReal-life applications of queuing theory cover a wide range of businesses. Its findings may be used to provide faster customer service, increase traffic flow, improve order shipments from a warehouse, or design data networks and call centers.\n\nQueuing theory aims to design balanced systems that serve customers quickly and efficiently but do not cost too much to be sustainable. As a branch of operations research, queuing theory can help inform business decisions on how to build more efficient and cost-effectiveworkflowsystems.\n\nThe origin of queuing theory can be traced to the early 1900s in a study of the Copenhagen telephone exchange by Agner Krarup Erlang, a Danish engineer, statistician, and mathematician. His work led to the Erlang theory of efficient networks and the field of telephone network analysis.\n\nAt its most basic level, queuing theory involves the analysis of arrivals at a facility, such as a bank or a fast-foodrestaurant, and analyzing the processes currently in place to serve them. The result is a set of conclusions that aim to identify any flaws in the system and suggest how they can be alleviated. The fundamental unit of telecommunications traffic in voice systems is called the Erlang.\n\nQueuing theory as an operations management technique is commonly used to determine and streamline staffing needs, scheduling, and inventory to improve overall customer service.Six Sigmapractitioners often use it to improve processes.\n\nQueues are not necessarily a negative aspect of a business, as their absence suggests overcapacity.\n\nIn queuing theory, the process being studied is broken down into six distinct parameters. These include the following:\n\nQueues can occur whenever resources are limited. Some queuing is tolerable in any business since a total absence of a queue would suggest a costlyovercapacity.\n\nThe psychology of queuing is related to queuing theory. This is the component of queuing that deals with the natural irritation felt by many people who are forced to queue for service, whether they're waiting to check out at the supermarket or waiting for a website to load.\n\nA call-back option while waiting to speak to a customer representative by phone is one example of a solution to customer impatience. A more old-fashioned example is the system used by many delis, which issues customer service numbers to allow people to track their progress to the front of the queue.\n\nThe queuing theory can be used and applied in several different situations. For instance, it can be applied to:\n\nHow it works and how involved it may be depends on the complexity of the case involved.\n\nOne major limitation of queuing theory is its reliance on specific assumptions. Many queuing models assume that arrivals follow aPoisson processand that service times are exponentially distributed. While this helps simplify the mathematical model, this isn't always how things work in real systems. For example, customer arrivals may occur in bursts rather than at regular intervals, or service times might vary significantly depending on the complexity of each request.\n\nIn practice, unpredictable customer behavior can also complicate systems beyond what standard queuing theory can handle. For instance, some customers may abandon the queue after waiting for too long, while others may decide not to join a long queue at all. These two functions may depend on an individual's unique preferences.\n\nAnother challenge is the static nature of most queuing models. Queuing theory often relies on steady-state conditions. However, in reality, many environments are dynamic. For example, a retail store may experience sudden surges in customer traffic during holiday seasons, though queuing theory may be more useful in steadier, more predictable periods like the non-holiday windows.\n\nA paper by Stanford Graduate School of Business Professor Lawrence Wein et al. used queuing theory to analyze a variety of possible emergency responses to an airborne bioterrorism attack in a public place. The model pointed to specific actions that could be taken to reduce the wait time for emergency care, thus decreasing the potential number of deaths.\n\nQueuing theory is useful, if not quite so urgent, in guiding thelogisticsof many businesses. The operations department for a delivery company, for example, is likely to use queuing theory to help it smooth out the kinks in its systems for moving packages from a warehouse to a customer. In this case, the line being studied is comprised of boxes of goods waiting to be delivered to customers.\n\nBy applying queuing theory, a business can develop more efficient systems, processes, pricing mechanisms, staffing solutions, and arrival management strategies to reduce customer wait times and increase the number of customers that can be served.\n\nQueuing theory is used to identify and correct points of congestion in a process. The queue may consist of people, things, or information. In any case, they are being forced to wait for service. That is inefficient, bad for business, and annoying (when the queue consists of people). Queuing theory is used to analyze the existing process and map out alternatives with a better result.\n\nAgner Krarup Erlang, a Danish mathematician, statistician, and engineer, is credited with creating not only queuing theory but the entire field of telephone traffic engineering.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Erlang was head of a technical laboratory at the Copenhagen Telephone Co. His extensive studies of wait time in automated telephone services and his proposals for more efficient networks were widely adopted by telephone companies.\n\nA study of a line using queuing theory would break it down into six elements: the arrival process, the queue or service capacity, the number of servers available, the size of the client population, the queuing discipline (such as first-in, first-out), and the departure process. Creating a model of the entire process from start to finish allows the cause or causes of congestion to be identified and addressed.\n\nQueuing theory is a mathematic discipline that looks at lines\u2014specifically, how they form, how they work, and why they sometimes don't work. Queuing is an unavoidable facet of doing business, with customers apt to contend with physical or digital lines, depending on what they are trying to purchase. Queuing has an impact on manufacturing, inventory, shipping, and distribution. As a result, queuing impacts profits and revenues. Findings from queuing theory can be used to improve customer service, traffic flow, and order shipments, among other aspects of running a business.\n\nUniversity of Houston. \"Erlang.\"\n\nErlang, A.
