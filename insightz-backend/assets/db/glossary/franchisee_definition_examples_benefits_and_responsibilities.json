  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nDavid is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA franchisee is an independent business owner who operates a third-party retail outlet called afranchise. This means that the franchisee purchases the right to use an existing business'strademarks, associated brands, and proprietary knowledge to market and sell the same brand and uphold the same standards as the parent business, which is known as the franchisor.\n\nA franchisee is an individual who is licensed to do business under an existing company's name. The franchisee buys the rights to the franchise. This means they purchase the right to use the brands, products, materials, and trademarks of theparent company, which is known as thefranchisor.\n\nA business that wants to increase itsmarket shareor geographical presence at a low cost can create a franchise. Franchises are available across a wide variety of industries and have become an extremely popular way for individuals to do business. It is hard to drive more than a few blocks in most cities without seeing franchise businesses.\n\nFranchisees are usually responsible for paying a franchise fee (the price paid when they sign the contract) and may be required to have a minimum initial investment ornet worthbefore they can purchase a franchise. Once established, they must pay fees and royalties. According to a 2023 report from Franchise Business Review, the average franchisee's annual income was $102,910.\n\nBecoming a franchisee can be exciting and rewarding\u2014especially because some of the work is already done for you. We've laid out some steps to becoming a franchisee if you've ever wanted to start a business under an existing brand name:\n\nThe relationship between a franchisee and a franchisor is inherently one of advisee and advisor. The franchisor provides guidance and support on hiring and training staff, setting up shop, advertising its products or services, sourcing its supply, and so on.\n\nThe franchisor assigns the franchisee an exclusive location far enough from its other franchises once the two parties sign the contract. This helps the new and existing franchisees avoid direct competition. The franchisee pays a franchise fee and ongoing royalty or license fees in exchange for the franchise, which includes the use of the company'sintellectual property, and experience.\n\nAs with any investment, research your options thoroughly before you decide to purchase a franchise.\n\nA franchisee must follow the proven business model that is already in place, down to its choice of location, furnishings, products, and decor. Franchisors require this to maintain consistent quality among all of the locations using its brand name.\n\nThe franchisee is responsible for growing the franchise via the usual means of advertising and marketing within its exclusive area of operation. However, allmarketing campaignsmust be approved by the original establishment before their release.\n\nAs the manager of the franchise, the franchisee is expected to protect the brand name by offering only approved products and services that are created by or sourced by the original company.\n\nOperating a franchise can be an ideal venture for anentrepreneurwith little or no direct experience in business management because:\n\nWhile there are perks of being a franchisee, there are also drawbacks. Potential franchisees should consider that:\n\nLower startup costs than building a business from the ground up\n\nCapitalize on the franchisor's existing brand, supply system, and marketing\n\nAbility to adopt franchisor's business practices\n\nFranchisor actively advises and helps franchisee\n\nHigh franchise fees and initial investments\n\nFranchisee isn't completely independent\n\nMust pay ongoing fees and royalties\n\nDamage to brand can put the franchise at risk\n\nSome of the most common examples include Subway, United Parcel Service (UPS), H&R Block (HRB), and McDonald's (MCD). As of 2024, there were more than 38,000McDonald'srestaurants in more than 100 countries, and 93% of them are owned and operated by local business people.\n\nThe company was founded in 1940 by the McDonald brothers in San Bernardino, California. However, it was their business associate Ray Kroc who opened the first official franchise in 1955 in Des Plaines, Illinois. Kroc later bought the business from the brothers.\n\nThe success of McDonald's franchise story is partly a result of the company's commitment to maintaining consistent standards in its food. A Big Mac in Los Angeles should and does have the same quality as one in London.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s either owns the land and buildings or secures long-term leases for the franchised sites, and it only considers franchisees who have at least $500,000 in non-borrowed personal resources.The franchisee agrees to pay part of the cost of seating, d\u00e9cor, and signs. Franchisees also manage their own pricing decisions and staffing while benefiting from the brand equity and global experience of McDonald\u2019s.\n\nYes, a franchisee is the owner of the business. The owner is licensed to use products supplied by the franchisor. The franchisee is contractually obligated to use only products and services supplied by or authorized by the franchisor.\n\nThis limits the business owner's scope and autonomy. A McDonald's franchisee cannot sell a peanut butter and jelly sandwich or even hang a picture on the wall that isn't issued by McDonald's.\n\nNo. The franchisor is the entity that owns the intellectual property, patents, and trademarks of the brand or business being franchised. A franchisee buys the right to operate a location of the franchisor.\n\nA franchisee can effectively be fired. The franchisor can shut down one of its licensed operators that breaks the rules. Those rules allow the franchisor to act quickly if a franchisee is discovered to be running a location that fails to meet health and safety guidelines, among other infractions.\n\nThe franchise model is expanding in new directions. The classic is the McDonald's model in which a business person adopts the entire product line and merchandising model of a franchisor. Other companies such as Domino's Pizza, Burger King,\u00a0Jiffy Lube, and RE/MAX also offer well-known franchise opportunities.\n\nNewer franchising models are emerging, particularly in services businesses such as home healthcare and tax preparation. There also is growth in business distribution franchises. This is a supplier/dealer relationship in which the dealer acquires exclusive rights to sell a supplier's goods within a certain area.\n\nBut, franchising isn't for everyone. Being a franchisee is best suited to an individual who wants to buy into a proven business model and not invent one from scratch.\n\nFranchise Business Review. \"Franchise Business Review Announces 2023 Most Profitable Franchises.\"\n\nMcDonald's. \"Franchising Overview.\"\n\nMcDonald's. \"Can You Still Get a McDonald's Franchise (in the United States) and How Much Does It Cost?\"",
