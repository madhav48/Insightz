The amount you save will depend on your income and tax bracket. That being said, although the amounts have gone up for 2025, the differences from last year aren\u2019t huge.\n\nSingle taxpayers and married individuals filing separately in the 2025tax yearwill be eligible to claim $400 more in theirstandard tax deductioncompared to 2024, as the standard deduction for this category of taxpayer has risen to $15,000 from $14,600.\n\nFor married couples filing jointly, the standard deduction for 2025 is $30,000, allowing them to claim $800 more as compared to 2024. And for heads of households, the 2025 standard deduction is $22,500, an increase of $600 as compared to the 2024 tax year.\n\nWhen you file your taxes, you\u2019re eligible to subtract a certain amount of money from your gross income each year. This lowers the amount of money you\u2019re obligated to pay taxes on. TheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)releases these numbers as part of its annual inflation adjustments each year; the 2025 figures were announced in October 2024.\n\nHere are the standard deduction amounts for 2024 and 2025 by filing status:\n\nIf you\u2019re age 65 or older at the end of the tax year, you are allowed an additional standard deduction amount of $1,600 for 2025.

This will give you your taxable income. From there, you can apply the tax rate that corresponds to your income bracket. If you're usingtax software, it will do these calculations for you automatically.\n\nThe standard deduction is a fixed amount, but theitemized deduction methodallows you to deduct specific expenses if they exceed the standard amount. You might also need to use the itemized method if you\u2019re not eligible for the standard method. Itemized deductions can include amounts paid during the taxable year for:\n\nNote that certain dollar limitations and other limitations apply to the above categories, and that you will need to submit receipts to back up each item included in case you areaudited.\n\nThe IRS adjusts the standard deduction amount each year for inflation, and although it has increased for the 2025 tax year, the amounts aren\u2019t likely to make a huge difference as compared to 2024. Depending on your situation, it may be worth taking the time to track and save receipts for anything that might be claimed under the itemized method if you anticipate that the amount might be higher than the standard deduction amount.\n\nIRS. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nIRS. \"Topic No. 551, Standard Deduction.\"\n\nIRS. \"Topic No. 501, Should I Itemize?\"",
