  "term": "Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index (VXN): What it Means, How it Works",
  "definition": "The Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index (VXN) is a measure of market expectations of 30-dayvolatilityfor theNasdaq 100index, as implied by the prices ofoptionslisted on this index.TheCboe Global Markets (Cboe)launched the VXN in January 2001.\n\nThe VXN index is a widely watched gauge of market sentiment and volatility for the Nasdaq-100, which includes the top 100 U.S. and international non-financial securities by market capitalization listed on the Nasdaq. The VXN is quoted in percentage terms, just like its better-known counterpart theCboe Volatility Index (VIX), which measures 30-day implied volatility for the S&P 500 index.\n\nThe Cboe Nasdaq Volatility Index was introduced in 2001 as thedot-com bubblein technology stocks was deflating. Cboe developed the VXN because of the massive divergence between the volatility seen in the Nasdaq market compared to the broader U.S. equity market from early 1999 onward.\n\nIndeed, the Nasdaq soared 157% in a 15-month period from January 1999 to its peak level of 5,048 on March 10, 2000, before plunging 52% to below 2,500 by December 20, 2000.TheS&P 500, by comparison, only gained 21% from January 1999 to its March 24, 2000 peak, and then declined back down 18% by the end of 2000.\n\nThe higher the VXN level, the greater the expectation for Nasdaq-100 volatility. Like the VIX, the VXN functions best as a \u201cfear gauge\u201d or indicator of market nervousness about the technology sector.\n\nSince its introduction, the highest level reached by the VXN was 71.72 in September 2001, brought on by the 9/11 attack. Other notable peaks include 79.16 in October 2008, at the height of the global financial crisis, and 80.08 in March 2020, as the world reeled under the global economic shutdown. The 2020 crisis-induced VXN spike proved to be short-lived as the gauge returned to levels in the 30s. On the flip side, the lowest level was 10.31 in March 2017.\n\nThe methodology used by the Cboe to calculate the VXN\u2014whose value it disseminates continuously during trading hours\u2014is identical to that used for the VIX. VXN components are near-term (with at least one week to expiration) put and call options, and next-term options in the first and second Nasdaq-100 contract months (options with more than 23 days and less than 37 days to expiration). The selected options are out-of-the-money Nasdaq-100 puts and calls centered on an at-the-money strike price.\n\nMovement in the VXN represents the level ofimplied volatilityfrom the prices of listed options on the Nasdaq 100 index. Increases in the VXN and positive movement represent higher variances in the underlying securities\u2019 price from their average. This usually occurs with uncertainty.\n\nDecreases in the VXN and negative movement represents lower volatility and a greater propensity for prices to trade in a tighter range. The VXN is generally followed along with theNasdaq 100to understand volatility in relation to positive or negative movements in the prices of the index.\n\nCboe Global Markets. \"Cboe NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index.\"\n\nNasdaq. \"NASDAQ Grants License to the CBOE Futures Exchange to Trade Futures On the CBOE NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index.\"\n\nCboe Global Markets. \"Cboe VIX FAQ,\" Select, \"What is the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX Index)?\"\n\nResearchGate. \"More Than You Ever Wanted to Know About Volatility Swaps.\"\n\nCboe Global Markets. \"Cboe NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index Methodology,\" Page 1.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"NASDAQ Composite Index (NASDAQCOM).\"\n\nYahoo Finance. \"S&P 500 (^GSPC): Historical Data,\" Select Time Period \"Dec. 31, 1998 - Dec. 31, 2000.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"CBOE NASDAQ 100 Volatility Index (VXNCLS).\"\n\nCboe Global Markets. \"Cboe VIX FAQ,\" Select, \"How is the VIX Index calculated?\"\n\nCboe Global Markets. \"Cboe NASDAQ-100 Volatility Index Methodology.\"",
