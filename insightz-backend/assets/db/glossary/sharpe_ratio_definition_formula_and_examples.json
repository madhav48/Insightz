  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio shows whether a portfolio's excess returns are attributable to smart investment decisions or luck and risk.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio was developed by economistWilliam F. Sharpein 1966. It compares the return of an investment with its risk.\n\nThe ratio's numerator is the difference between realized, or expected, returns and a benchmark such as therisk-free rate of returnor the performance of a particular investment category over time. Its denominator is the standard deviation of returns over the same period, a measure of volatility and risk.\n\nEconomist William F. Sharpe proposed the Sharpe ratio in 1966 as an outgrowth of his work on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), calling it the reward-to-variability ratio. Sharpe won the Nobel Prize in economics for his work on CAPM in 1990.\n\nSharpeRatio=Rp\u2212Rf\u03c3pwhere:Rp=return\u00a0of\u00a0portfolioRf=risk-free\u00a0rate\u03c3p=standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0portfolio\u2019s\u00a0excess\u00a0return\\begin{aligned} &\\textit{Sharpe Ratio} = \\frac{R_p - R_f}{\\sigma_p}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &R_{p}=\\text{return of portfolio}\\\\ &R_{f} = \\text{risk-free rate}\\\\ &\\sigma_p = \\text{standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return}\\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bSharpe\u00a0Ratio=\u03c3p\u200bRp\u200b\u2212Rf\u200b\u200bwhere:Rp\u200b=return\u00a0of\u00a0portfolioRf\u200b=risk-free\u00a0rate\u03c3p\u200b=standard\u00a0deviation\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0portfolio\u2019s\u00a0excess\u00a0return\u200b\n\nStandard deviationis derived from the variability of returns for a series of time intervals, adding up to the total performance sample under consideration.\n\nThe numerator's total return differential versus a benchmark (Rp-Rf)is calculated as the average of the return differentials in each of the incremental periods making up the total. For example, the numerator of a 10-year Sharpe ratio might be the average of 120 monthly return differentials for a fund versus an industry benchmark.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio's denominator in that example will be those monthly returns standard deviation, calculated as follows:\n\nThe Sharpe ratio is one of the most widely used methods for measuring risk-adjusted relative returns. It compares a fund's historical or projected returns relative to an investment benchmark with the historical or expectedvariabilityof such returns.\n\nThe risk-free rate was initially used in the formula to denote an investor's hypothetical minimal borrowing costs. More generally, it represents therisk premiumof an investment versus a safe asset such as a Treasury bill or bond.\n\nWhen benchmarked against the returns of an industry sector or investing strategy, the Sharpe ratio provides a measure of risk-adjusted performance not attributable to such affiliations.\n\nThe ratio is useful in determining to what degree excess historical returns were accompanied by excess volatility. While excess returns are measured in comparison with an investing benchmark, the standard deviation formula gauges volatility based on the variance of returns from their mean.\n\nThe ratio's utility relies on the assumption that the historical record of relative risk-adjusted returns has at least some predictive value.\n\nGenerally, the higher the Sharpe ratio, the more attractive the risk-adjusted return.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio can be used to evaluate a portfolio\u2019s risk-adjusted performance. Alternatively, an investor could use a fund's return objective to estimate its projected Sharpe ratioex-ante.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio can help explain whether a portfolio's excess returns are attributable to smart investment decisions or simply luck and risk.\n\nFor example, low-quality, highly speculative stocks can outperform blue chip shares for considerable periods, as during theDot-Com Bubbleor, more recently, thememe stocksfrenzy. If a YouTuber happens to beat Warren Buffett in the market for a while as a result, the Sharpe ratio will provide a quick reality check by adjusting each manager's performance for their portfolio's volatility.\n\nThe greater a portfolio's Sharpe ratio, the better its risk-adjusted performance. A negative Sharpe ratio means the risk-free or benchmark rate is greater than the portfolio\u2019s historical or projected return, or else the portfolio's return is expected to be negative.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio can be manipulated by portfolio managers seeking to boost theirapparent risk-adjusted returnshistory. This can be done by lengthening the return measurement intervals, which results in a lower estimate of volatility.\n\nFor example, the standard deviation (volatility) of annual returns is generally lower than that of monthly returns, which are in turn less volatile than daily returns. Financial analysts typically consider the volatility of monthly returns when using the Sharpe ratio.\n\nCalculating the Sharpe ratio for the most favorable stretch of performance rather than an objectively chosen look-back period is another way to cherry-pick the data that will distort the risk-adjusted returns.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio also has some inherent limitations. The standard deviation calculation in the ratio's denominator, which serves as its proxy for portfolio risk, calculates volatility based on anormal distributionand is most useful in evaluating symmetricalprobability distributioncurves.\n\nIn contrast, financial markets subject toherding behaviorcan go to extremes much more often than a normal distribution would suggest is possible. As a result, the standard deviation used to calculate the Sharpe ratio may understatetail risk.\n\nMarket returns are also subject toserial correlation. The simplest example is that returns in adjacent time intervals may be correlated because they were influenced by the same market trend. Butmean reversionalso depends on serial correlation, just likemarket momentum.\n\nThe upshot is that serial correlation tends to lower volatility, and as a result, investment strategies dependent on serial correlation factors may exhibit misleadingly high Sharpe ratios.\n\nOne way to visualize these criticisms is to consider the investment strategy of picking up nickels in front of a steamroller that moves slowly and predictably nearly all the time, except for the few rare occasions when it suddenly and fatally accelerates.\n\nBecause such unfortunate events are extremely uncommon, those picking up nickels would, most of the time, deliver positive returns with minimal volatility, earning high Sharpe ratios as a result.\n\nAnd if a fund picking up the proverbial nickels in front of a steamroller got flattened on one of those extremely rare and unfortunate occasions, its long-term Sharpe might still look good: just one bad month, after all. Unfortunately, that would bring little comfort to the fund's investors.\n\nThe standard deviation in the Sharpe ratio's formula assumes that price movements in either direction are equally risky. The risk of an abnormally low return is very different from the possibility of an abnormally high one for most investors and analysts.\n\nA variation of the Sharpe called theSortino ratioignores the above-average returns to focus solely ondownside deviationas a better proxy for the risk of a fund or portfolio.\n\nThe standard deviation in the denominator of a Sortino ratio measures the variance of negative returns or those below a chosen benchmark relative to the average of such returns.\n\nAnother variation of the Sharpe is theTreynor ratio, which divides excess return over a risk-free rate or benchmark by the beta of a security, fund, or portfolio as a measure of itssystematic riskexposure.\n\nBeta measures the degree to which the volatility of a stock or fund correlates with that of the market as a whole. The goal of the Treynor ratio is to determine whether an investor is being compensated for extra risk above that posed by the market.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio is sometimes used in assessing how adding an investment might affect the risk-adjusted returns of the portfolio.\n\nFor example, an investor is considering adding a hedge fund allocation to a portfolio that has returned 18% over the last year. The current risk-free rate is 3%, and the annualized standard deviation of the portfolio\u2019s monthly returns was 12%, which gives it a one-year Sharpe ratio of 1.25, or (18% - 3%) / 12%.\n\nThe investor believes that adding the hedge fund to the portfolio will lower the expected return to 15% for the coming year, but also expects the portfolio\u2019s volatility to drop to 8% as a result. The risk-free rate is expected to remain the same over the coming year.\n\nUsing the same formula with the estimated future numbers, the investor finds the portfolio would have a projected Sharpe ratio of 1.5, or (15% - 3%) divided by 8%.\n\nIn this case, while the hedge fund investment is expected to reduce the absolute return of the portfolio, based on its projected lower volatility, it would improve the portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nIf the new investment lowered the Sharpe ratio,o it would be assumed to be detrimental to risk-adjusted returns, based on forecasts. This example assumes that the Sharpe ratio based on the portfolio's historical performance can be fairly compared to that using the investor's return and volatility assumptions.\n\nSharpe ratios above 1 are generally considered \u201cgood,\" offering excess returns relative to volatility. However, investors often compare the Sharpe ratio of a portfolio or fund with those of its peers or market sector. So a portfolio with a Sharpe ratio of 1 might be found lacking if most rivals have ratios above 1.2, for example.A good Sharpe ratioin one context might be just a so-so one, or worse, in another.\n\nTo calculate the Sharpe ratio, investors first subtract the risk-free rate from the portfolio\u2019s rate of return, often using U.S. Treasury bond yields as a proxy for the risk-free rate of return. Then, they divide the result by the standard deviation of the portfolio\u2019s excess return.\n\nAs of Sept. 28, 2024, the S&P 500 Portfolio Sharpe ratio is 2.91.\n\nThe Sharpe ratio, named after its creator, William F. Sharpe, is a mathematical expression that helps investors compare the return of an investment with its risk. To calculate the Sharpe ratio, investors can subtract the risk-free rate of return from the expected rate of return, and then divide that result by the standard deviation (the asset's volatility).\n\nThe Sharpe ratio can be helpful only when used to compare very similar investments, like mutual funds and ETFs that track the same underlying index. Still, investors should keep in mind that those investments with a higher Sharpe ratio can be more volatile than those with a lower rate.\n\nStanford University. \"The Sharpe Ratio.\"\n\nThe Nobel Prize. \"William F.
