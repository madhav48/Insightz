  "definition": "Key ratio is the name given to anyfinancial ratiothat's considered particularly effective at measuring, illustrating, and summarizing a company's financials in relation to its competitors or peers.\n\nInvestors and companies rely on key ratios all the time to get a snapshot ofliquidity, efficiency, profitability, and so forth. Each key ratio focuses on a particular aspect of the company, meaning it is often necessary to consult several of them to get a more complete idea of how the subject is faring. Those that are in soundfinancial healthwill have superior ratios to those that are performing poorly.\n\nKey ratios take data from a company'sfinancial statements, such as its balance sheet, income statement, andstatement of cash flows, and then compare them with other items. These numbers are then calculated together to produce a ratio that represents key aspects of the company's financial picture, such as liquidity, profitability, use of debt, and earnings strength.\n\nThere are plenty of financial ratios at one's disposal and determining which are key varies according to opinion and popularity. Some of the most prevalent ratios include:\n\nNot all companies operate in the same way, so commonly used ratios tend to vary by industry. In other words, the ratios applied to best compare technology companies won't be the same as those used to effectively compare banks.\n\nIn the case of the latter, it's typical to utilize the capital to assets ratio, the loanloss reservesto total loans ratio, and the liquidity ratio.

When utilized correctly, they can help us to pinpoint each company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and discover how it stacks up against its peers.\n\nComparisons should be made with companies that are in the same industry and, ideally, have similarbusiness models.\n\nThat said, investors must be careful when using key ratios. Applying just one or two is usually not sufficient enough to get the full picture. A company can seldom be properly evaluated or analyzed using just one ratio in isolation.\n\nMoreover, it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that companies may adhere to differentaccounting practices, making them harder to compare. A combination of ratios should be used in conjunction with one another after determining which are the most appropriate for a given case.",
