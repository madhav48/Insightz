  "definition": "Financial analysis evaluates a business\u2019s financial health and performance by reviewing its financial data. It helps management run the business better and outside investors decide whether the company is worth buying into.\n\nFinancial analysis works with a company\u2019s financials to determine its health, performance, and potential. This data, which comes fromfinancial statementsand other reports, is used by investors and companies to make strategic decisions.\n\nFor outsiders, that could be deciding whether to buy shares in the company. For management, it could mean establishing how to run the business better and set goals.\n\nA company\u2019s success is measured by its financials. Their accounts and statements contain a lot of information represented in figures. Financial analysis aims to turn these numbers into actionable intelligence.\n\nRatiosare generally preferred over looking at individual numbers. Relationships between different pieces of financial data are explored by dividing one figure on a financial statement by another. The results can then be compared against the company\u2019s historical performance orother companies.\n\nFinancial analysis also tries to be forward-thinking, which involves extrapolating from the data for projections.\n\nOther than company leaders, manystakeholders\u2014investors, investment analysts, lenders, and auditors\u2014have an interest in financially analyzing a firm.\n\nInvestors and analysts assess a company\u2019s financials to determine if investing in it or lending money to it is worthwhile. They undertakeratio analysis, examiningliquidity,cash flow,leverage, andprofitabilityto see if the company is healthy and well-run compared with its past performance or peer firms. Analysts and investors will also want to know if the company is being fairlyvalued\u2014an important fact not just for the stock market but also for auditors, unions, regulators, and private equity firms.\n\nAccountants and others within a company analyze financial data to improve business decision making. Analyzing financials can help identify weaknesses before they turn into a crisis and is used to set budgets, ensure the right amount of inventory is ordered, assess thereturn on investmenton specific strategies, and calculate a fair price to pay for an asset or acquisition.\n\nBelow is a summary of these and other stakeholders who use financial analysis.\n\nHere are some of the most common types of financial analysis:\n\nVertical analysiscompares each line item on a financial statement as a percentage of a base figure within the same statement. Revenue usually serves as the base figure (100%) on the income statement, while total assets, total liabilities, and equity serve as the base on the balance sheet.\n\nFor example, if a company has $10 million in revenue and $2 million in operating expenses, vertical analysis would show operating expenses as 20% of revenue. This makes it easier to spot when costs are consuming too much revenue compared with the company\u2019s historical performance or the industry standard. For instance, if the industry average forgross marginis 60% of revenue but a company\u2019s gross margin is only 45% of revenue, this could indicate pricing problems or inefficient operations that need attention.\n\nThus, the real power of vertical analysis comes from comparisons:\n\nHorizontal analysis(also called trend analysis) tracks how financial items change over time by comparing multiple periods of financial data. It shows both dollar and percentage changes, helping identify growth patterns, cyclical trends, and potential problems.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say a company\u2019srevenuefigures are as follows:\n\nThis analysis would reveal not just growth from the base year but also the drop in 2024. When applied across all financial statements, horizontal analysis can uncover significant trends such as:\n\nMost importantly, horizontal analysis can identify unusual changes that deserve investigation. A sudden spike in expenses, an unexpected drop in gross margin, or unusual growth in certain liabilities could all signal issues requiring management\u2019s attention.\n\nCompanies borrow money (or use leverage) to finance operations and their expansion. Using leverage to their advantage is important, but it\u2019s also crucial that companies don\u2019t overextend themselves.\n\nJust looking at the amount ofdebtisn\u2019t enough. To get a more complete picture, you need to compare borrowing to revenue, growth, and so forth.\n\nThus, analysts turn to tools like thedebt-to-equity ratio, which reveals how much the company relies on debt\u00a0to finance its operations, and thedebt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio, which indicates how much income the company has available to cover its debt and otherliabilities.\n\nLiquidity analysis\u00a0assesses a company\u2019s ability to pay off its short-term bills and debts. Tools used to analyze liquidity include the acid test, orquick ratio, whichmeasures a company\u2019s capacity to meet its short-term obligations payable within one year with its most liquid assets such as cash,marketable securities, and money owed from customers.\n\nCompanies are mainly judged on how big a profit they generate, and profitability analysis measures how well they\u2019re doing at that.\n\nCommon profitability analysis tools includereturn on invested capital,which tells us how well acompany invests its money, and various forms ofprofit margins, which essentially calculate how many cents per dollar a company receives from a sale.\n\nOne of the keys to running a business successfully is getting the best possible output from the smallest number ofinputs. Efficiency analysis evaluates how well an organization utilizes its resources.\n\nPopular efficiency analysis tools include theinventory turnover ratio, which measures how well inventory levels are managed, and theasset turnover ratio, which calculates how efficiently a company uses the resources at its disposal to generate revenue.\n\nCash flow, the movement of money into and out of a company, is crucial to a business. It\u2019s harder to manipulate than profit. It is used to pay dividends and expenses and fund expansions, and is perhaps the best indicator that a company has a sustainable business model.\n\nWays to assess a company\u2019s cash flow includefree cash flow, which shows the amount of money left after paying for operating expenses and capital expenditures;operating cash flow, which is cash generated by a business\u2019s regular operating activities; and the current liabilitycoverage ratio, which assesses a company\u2019s ability to cover its current liabilities with the cash flow from its operations.\n\nBelow is a summary of these and other types of financial analysis, along with the main ratios and methods used for them:\n\nHere are two examples of financial analysis being put to use.\n\nManagement at a retail company notices that cash flow is dwindling and asks internal accountants to investigate what the possible causes could be. After scouring the accounts, one thing in particular stands out: Accounts receivable, which represents money owed to a company by its customers, has been rising substantially.\n\nThe accountants look at theaccounts receivable turnover ratioanddays sales outstandingto determine the company\u2019s efficiency at collecting payments from customers. This analysis reveals not only that payments must be collected sooner but also that credit criteria need to be tightened to prevent defaults and ensure the company has enough cash on hand to fund its day-to-day operations.\n\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re bullish about the potential for growth incompanies that produce weight-loss drugs. You compile a list of the most prominent firms in this area and screen them to determine the best stock to choose from.\n\nYou start with theprice-to-earnings ratio, which tells you how much investors are willing to pay for $1 of earnings in a company. Then you might look at theenterprise value (EV)-to-revenue multipleand theEV-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) multiple. The lower the ratios, the better. (These ratios are found for most stocks on major financial websites, including Investopedia.)\n\nFinally, you can look at each company\u2019s return on invested capital to gauge which firm has historically done a better job investing its money. Comparing these valuations, you then make a short list of companies whose stock you will buy.\n\nA lot of information is contained within a company\u2019s financials. Analyzing it can help uncover activity that was not immediately apparent and can improve decision making. With the help of ratios, companies can identify problems, trends, and prospects and maximize efficiency.\n\nInvestors, meanwhile, can see how a company stacks up against its past performance and peer group and quickly get an idea of its health, profitability, and the attractiveness of its share price.",
