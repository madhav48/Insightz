  "definition": "Daniel Rathburn is an editor at Investopedia who works on tax, accounting, regulatory, and cryptocurrency content.\n\nA white elephant is something whose cost of upkeep is not in line with its usefulness or value. From an investmentperspective, the term refers to anasset, property, or business that is so expensive to operate and maintain that it is extremely difficult to actually make aprofitfrom it.\n\nWhite elephants also tend to beilliquidassets, meaning they cannot be easily or quickly exchanged or sold for cash without the seller experiencing a significant loss.\n\nA white elephant is a burdensome possession. When applied to investments, it can be used to describe anything that is expensive to maintain, unprofitable, andimpossible to sell. In other words, a white elephant is a name given to undesirable investments that are more trouble than they are worth.\n\nCorporations may invest money inproperty, plant, and equipment(PP&E) with the goal of using these fixed assets to improve the company's bottom line in the future. However, if economic conditions change, these assets can become white elephants. For example, suppose a company builds a factory to meet anticipated demand for its new product line. If the product fails to sell, that new factory becomes an expensive property that does not help the company generate enoughrevenueto cover the cost of its maintenance.\n\nOver the years, the term white elephant has also been linked to various government-funded construction projects. Governments look to these endeavors to generate rapideconomic growthby funneling lots of money into subsidized building andinfrastructureprojects.\n\nIn the United States, funding for these projects sometimes comes in the form of controversialearmarks, which refers to spending provisions slipped into legislation that allocates money for a project favored by a particular politician or government official. Critics of these white elephant projects point out they are frequently ill-conceived, poorly planned, and awaste of taxpayer money.\n\nThe term white elephant derives from Asia. The white elephant is an icon with roots in Siam, now commonly known as Thailand. These rare animals were regarded as holy in ancient times and automatically gifted to the reigning monarch.\n\nThe story goes that the monarch would give the white elephant as a gift of either good or bad fortune. If he liked the recipient, he would gift land along with the elephant to help pay for the cost of the elephant. If he did not like you, he would not include land, turning the gift into a money pit.\n\nWhite elephants are common in real estate, as the following examples illustrate:\n\nThe Empire State Building is an example of a property that initially seemed destined to stay a white elephant, but eventually became a source of positive cash flow and growth. The property did not become profitable until the 1950s, more than 20 years after it was completed. Built against the backdrop of theGreat Depression, the building struggled to become an office building, despite being planned for that purpose.\n\nNow owned by areal estate investment trust(REIT), the building provides multiple sources of revenue. In 2019, the building's observation deck generated approximately $128.8 million, equal to about 39% of the building's total revenue.\ufeff\ufeff The building generates additional sources of revenue from leases of office and retail space along with fees generated from third-party television and radio broadcasters for use of its broadcasting mast.\n\nAnother example is the T-Mobile Center (formerly known as the Sprint Center) owned by the city of Kansas City, MO. The multi-purpose arena opened in 2007, hosting a concert by Elton John as its first event.\n\nAt a cost of roughly $276 million, the T-Mobile Center was supposed to house a major sports anchor team.\ufeff\ufeff Kansas City did enter discussions with the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League teams. However, as of 2020, neither league has agreed to relocate to the arena.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the Ryugyong Hotel. Originally intended to hold five revolving restaurants and over 3,000 hotel rooms, the Ryugyong Hotel stands 105 stories tall as a pyramid-shaped skyscraper in Pyongyang, North Korea.\n\nDevelopers began construction on the tallest structure inNorth Koreain 1987, but plans were later halted in 1992 due to a lack of funds. Eventually, in 2008, work on the building resumed, with a view to unveil its grand opening in 2012, the centenary of Kim Il-Sung's birth.\n\nAs of 2020, the building still remains unfinished, earning it the nickname the \"hotel of doom\" and the dubious distinction as the tallest unfinished building in the world.\n\nEmpire State Realty Trust. \"2019 Annual Report.\" Page 16.
