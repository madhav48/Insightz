  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nThe weighted average market capitalization refers to a type of stock market index construction that is based on themarket capitalizationof the index's\u00a0constituent\u00a0stocks. Large companies would, therefore, account for a greater\u00a0portion of an index than smaller stocks. This means the movement of an\u00a0index would depend\u00a0on a small set of stocks.\n\nThe most well-known market capitalization weight index is the S&P 500, which tracks the 500 largest assets by market capitalization. The top four\u00a0holdings combine\u00a0for over 10% of the entire index. These\u00a0include Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta, formerly Facebook, (META).The S&P 500 is widely considered a gauge of the strength of the broader\u00a0market and a\u00a0benchmark for performance.\n\nThe weighted average market capitalization is determined\u00a0by multiplying the current market price by the number of outstanding shares and then taking an\u00a0average to determine the weighting.\u00a0For example, if a company's market capitalization is $1 million, and the market capitalization of all stocks in the index is $100 million, the company would represent 1% of the index. Morningstar\u00a0calculates the metric by taking a geometric mean of the market capitalization of the stocks in a fund, whereas other providers use an arithmetic mean.\n\nSome investors believe a weighted average market capitalization is the optimal method of asset allocation as it reflects the actual behavior of markets. This way larger companies tend to have a greater influence over the index, just as is the case in the S&P 500. This leads to a natural rebalancing mechanism\u00a0where growing companies are admitted to the index, and shrinking ones become excluded. Investors also believe the methodology causes less risk because a larger proportion of the fund is allocated to stable\u00a0companies.\n\nBut there are some limitations to the strategy. When small-cap stocks outperform larger ones, as they have for most of history, there are fewer opportunities for index investors to gain lofty returns. Meanwhile, market-cap-weighted indexes\u00a0like the S&P 500 give off the appearance of diversification, but\u00a0a few stocks dictate a larger portion of the movement. This represents a big bet that theefficient market hypothesisholds through bull and bear markets.\n\nThe efficient market hypothesis says that stock prices reflect all information available, and trade at fair market value on all exchanges.\n\nAlternative methods of\u00a0asset allocation include price weighting and equal market cap weighting among many more. The holdings of a price-weighted index are determined by a simple mathematical average of several stock prices. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageis perhaps the most well-known index that employs\u00a0price\u00a0weighting.\n\nIn contrast, an equal-weighted index gives the same weight to each stock in a portfolio or fund. For example, theS&P 500 Equal Weight Indexis the equal-weighted version of the popular market-cap-weighted S&P 500.\n\nS&P Global. \"S&P Global LargeMidCap(JPY) Factsheet.\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.\n\nMorningstar. \"Average Market Capitalization.\" Accessed Dec, 9, 2021.\n\nNasdaq. \"Understanding the DJIA: How Price-Weighted Index Performance Attributions Differ From Cap-Weighted.\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.\n\nS&P Global. \"S&P 500 Equal Weight Index.\" Accessed Dec. 9, 2021.",
