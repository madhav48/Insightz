  "term": "Lapping Scheme: How to Detect and Prevent",
  "definition": "A lapping scheme is afraudulentpractice that involves an employee alteringaccounts receivablesto hide stolen cash.\n\nThe method involves taking a subsequent receivables payment from a transaction (for example, a sale) and using that to cover the theft. The receivable from the second transaction is covered by money from the third transaction, and so on.\n\nA lapping scheme can be detected by tracing how cash receipts have been applied to customer accounts. If there is evidence that cash receipts are routinely being applied to the wrong customer accounts, then there is likely an active lapping scheme in progress.\n\nAnother indicator of a lapping scheme is an employee who refuses to take the vacation time they've earned. This is because lapping requires that the 'lapper' (the individual engaged in the fraud) is involved every day, and so is unable to take any vacation time. One telltale sign of lapping is a rise in theaging of accounts receivable. A lapping scheme can only temporarily hide the theft. Sooner or later, the shortfall will show up and have to be recorded as a loss.\n\nLapping schemes typically happen in smaller companies where only one person may handle cash receipts and customer billing.\n\nCompanies can prevent lapping schemes by doing the following:\n\nSuppose that a company receives $150 for payment, but an accounting clerk diverts that to a personal account. To hide the theft, the clerk will apply the second receivable to come in, for example in the amount of $200, to the first receivable. That leaves $50 leftover to be applied to the second receivable, and $150 of it still to be paid. The clerk continues allocating (lapping) money from successive\u00a0sales\u00a0to the preceding\u00a0receivables\u00a0so the store's\u00a0accounting\u00a0records fail to reveal the discrepancy.",
