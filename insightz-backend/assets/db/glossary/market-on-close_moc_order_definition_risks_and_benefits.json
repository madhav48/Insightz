  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nA market-on-close (MOC) order is anon-limit market order, whichtradersexecute as near to the closing price as they can\u2014either exactly at, or slightly after the market close. The purpose of a MOC order is to get the last available price of that trading day. MOC orders are not available in all markets or from all brokers.\n\nAll MOC orders must be received atNew York Stock Exchange (NYSE)markets by 3:50 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), unless entered to offset a published imbalance. NYSE markets' rules also prohibit the cancellation or reduction in the size of any MOC order after 3:45 p.m. ET.\n\nOn theNasdaq, all MOC orders must be received at Island by 3:55 p.m. ET, but may not be canceled or modified after 3:50 p.m. ET.\n\nA market-on-close order is simply amarket orderthat is scheduled to trade at the close, at the most recent trading price. The MOC order remains dormant until near the close, at which time it becomes active.\u00a0Once the MOC order becomes active, it behaves like a normal market order. MOC orders can help investors to get into or out of the market at the closing price without having to place a market order immediately when the market closes.\n\nTraders often place MOC orders as part of atrading strategy. For example, some traders will want to exit at the close by either buying or selling a givenfinancial instrumentif a certain price level was breached during the trading day. MOC orders do not specify a target price, but traders sometimes use MOC orders as alimit-orderqualifier\u2014which means that a limit order will be automatically canceled if it isn't executed during the trading day.\n\nUsing a MOC order in this way ensures that the desired transaction isexecuted, but it still would leave the investor exposed to end-of-day price movements.\n\nAlthough placing a market-on-close (MOC) order can guarantee that your buy or sell order will occur at the close of trading, it does not guarantee the price.\n\nThere are a number of situations in which an investor might want to get the closing price of a security. If you suspect that a company's stock might move drastically overnight\u2014as the result of a scheduled after-hoursearnings callor an anticipated news story, for example\u2014then placing a MOC order would ensure that your purchase or sale would take place before the news breaks the next day.\n\nMOC orders can also be convenient when an investor knows that they're not going to be available to execute an essential transaction, like exiting aposition, at the end of the day. Being able to place market-on-close orders is also useful if you want to trade on some foreign exchanges that are not in your time zone.\n\nAn obvious drawback of MOC orders is that, if you will not be present at the close of the market, then you really do not know at what price your order will be filled.\u00a0In addition to risking end-of-day price fluctuations, MOC orders can also risk being poorly executed because of end-of-day tradingclusters, though this is rare.\n\nSuppose a trader owns 100 shares of company ABC, which is expected to report negative earnings after the closing bell. ABC's earnings have failed to surpass analysts' expectations for several quarters, but its stock price has not displayed adverse price movement during the day. In order to minimize losses from a selloff in ABC's shares after its earnings call, the trader places a MOC order to sell all or part of their shares in ABC.\n\nInteractiveBrokers. \"Market-on-Close (MOC) Orders.\"",
