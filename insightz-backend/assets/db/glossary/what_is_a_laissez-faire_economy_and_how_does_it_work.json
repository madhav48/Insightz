  "definition": "Laissez-faire is an economic theory dating back to the 18th century that opposes any government intervention in business affairs. The driving principle behind laissez-faire economics is that the less thegovernmentis involved in theeconomy, the better off business, and society as a whole, will be.\n\nIt is a French term that translates to \u201cleave alone,\u201d or more literally to \u201clet you do.\u201d\n\nLaissez-faire economics is a key component offree-marketcapitalism.\n\nThe underlying beliefs that make up the fundamentals of laissez-faire economics include the idea that economic competition constitutes a \u201cnatural order\u201d that rules the world. Because this natural self-regulation is the best type of regulation, laissez-faireeconomistsargue that there is no need for business and industrial affairs to be complicated bygovernment intervention.\n\nAs a result, they oppose any sort of federal involvement in the economy, which includes any type of legislation or oversight; they are againstminimum wages, duties, trade restrictions, andcorporate taxes. In fact, laissez-faire economists see such taxes as a penalty for production.\n\nLaissez-faire is often associated with libertarian views on the economy, where government plays an extremely limited role. In fact, one of the key characteristics of laissez-faire economics is that the government should only be involved with the following three functions:\n\nPopularized in the mid-1700s, the doctrine of laissez-faire is one of the first articulated economic theories. It originated with a group known as the Physiocrats, who flourished in France from about 1756 to 1778.These thinkers tried to apply scientific principles and methodology to the study of wealth and economic production.\n\nThese economists argued that a free market and free economiccompetitionwere extremely important to the health of a free society.They believed the government should only intervene in the economy to preserve property, life, and individual freedom; otherwise, the natural, unchanging laws that govern market forces and economic processes\u2014what later British economistAdam Smithdubbed the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d\u2014should be allowed to proceed unhindered.\n\nUnfortunately, an early effort to test laissez-faire theories did not go well. As an experiment in 1774, Turgot, Louis XVI\u2019s Controller-General of Finances, abolished all restraints on the heavily controlled grain industry, allowing imports and exports between provinces to operate as a free trade system. But when poor harvests caused scarcities, prices shot through the roof; merchants ended up hoarding supplies or selling grain in strategic areas, even outside the country for better profit, while thousands of French citizens starved. Riots ensued for several months. In the middle of 1775, order was restored, and with it, government controls over the grain market.\n\nDespite this inauspicious start, laissez-faire practices, developed further by such British economists as Smith andDavid Ricardo, ruled during theIndustrial Revolutionof the late 18th and early 19th centuries. And, as its detractors noted, it resulted in unsafe working conditions and large wealth gaps.\n\nOnly at the beginning of the 20th century did developed industrialized nations like the United States begin to implement significant government controls and regulations to protect workers from hazardous conditions and consumers from unfair business practices. However, it\u2019s important to note that these policies were not intended to restrict business practices and competition.\n\nLaissez-faire advocates argue that if individuals serve their own interests first, societal benefits will follow. One of the chief criticisms of laissez-faire is thatcapitalismas a system has moral ambiguities built into it; it does not inherently protect the weakest in society.\n\nAs such, detractors feel laissez-faire actually leads to poverty and economic imbalances. The idea of letting an economic system run without regulation or correction in effect dismisses or further victimizes those most in need of assistance, they say.\n\nThe 20th-century British economistJohn Maynard Keyneswas a prominent critic of laissez-faire economics, and he argued that the question of market solutions vs. government intervention needed to be decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nReduces government involvement in business, which is thought to be inefficient and stifling\n\nEncourages self-responsibility and innovation\n\nPromotes free markets and competition\n\nLack of regulations can harm consumers and the environment\n\nCan generate negative externalities\n\nCompetition naturally leads to wealth inequality\n\nLaissez-faire, in French, literally means \u201clet you do.\u201d Legend has it that the origins of the phrase \u201claissez-faire\u201d in an economic context came from a 1681 meeting between the French finance minister Jean-Baptise Colbert and a businessman named Le Gendre. As the story goes, Colbert asked Le Gendre how best the government could help commerce, to which Le Gendre replied \u201cLaissez-nous faire,\u201d meaning \u201clet us do.\u201d The Physiocrats popularized the phrase, using it to name their core economic doctrine.\n\nAn economy would follow the principles of laissez-faire if it followed an approach where the government was not at all involved in the workings of the economy, business, or markets. Instead, the free market would not only regulate prices but also discipline producers to remain good actors. In reality, such an economy does not exist. All economies, even in countries with highly libertarian values, have some degree of government regulation and intervention.\n\nIn laissez-faire capitalism, companies could operate with a pure profit motive and not have to worry about government regulation or taxation. This, of course, could create negative externalities and information asymmetries that can allow producers to behave as bad actors and get away with it. Proponents of laissez-faire say that costly and exhaustive regulation is not needed since the market would weed out such bad actors. In reality, however, bad actors may continue operating for a long while.\n\nLaissez-faire refers to an economic theory opposed to government intervention in the market. A central element of free-market capitalism, laissez-faire posits that businesses and society as a whole are significantly better off without government involvement. The idea dates back to 18th century France, and is popular in countries with libertarian values in the present.\n\nIvar Jonsson. \u201cThe Political Economy of Innovation and Entrepreneurship:\u00a0From Theories to Practice,\u201d Page 10.
