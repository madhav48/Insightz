  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nThe working-age population is the total population in an area that is considered able and likely to work. It is based on the number of people in\u00a0a\u00a0predetermined age range. That age range can vary, but it usually begins with older teenagers and goes into retirement age, such as 18-64 or 15-64.\n\nThe working-age population measure is used to give an estimate of the total number of potential workers within aneconomy. This is useful for understanding a variety of economic statistics.\n\nThe number of people in a specific age range will determine the working-age population. This number is the number of capable employees available in an economy, a country, or other specified region.\n\nThis measurement does not distinguish between those who are gainfully employed and those who are seeking employment within the range. The working-age population measurement is designed to analyze how many people are most likely to be ready and able to work.\n\nThe working-age population is a different statistic from the working population. Working population measures how many people in a region are employed, regardless of their age.\n\nThere are outliers in the working-age population group that the number also does not consider. Outliers include those who are actively employed but are outside of the designated age range. As an example, some people will continue to work past the standardretirementage. Other outliers are individuals within the age range who cannot work due to disability, illness, or caregiving responsibilities.\n\nAs thedemographicsof a region change, the working-age population of an economy will shift. Significant changes have\u00a0the potential to impact the economy significantly. An area with more people in the older range of its working-age population and few teenagers about to enter the workforce eventually could have trouble filling jobs.\n\nOn the flip side, a region with many young adults and teenagers entering the working-age population and fewer people in their 50s and 60s could soon see fierce competition for jobs. Additionally, an area with a disproportionate number of people outside the working-age population will rely on a smaller population to generaterevenuesfor the entire region.\n\nIdeally, a local economy should have a steady flow of people both entering and exiting the working-age population each year, as well as a healthy balance between those in the determined age range and those outside of it.\n\nIf a region has a working-age population that is declining or otherwise insufficient to meet employment demands in the area, the region will have difficulty attracting new industries or convincing existing industries to expand. Companies are less likely to open a new branch or a new factory in an area where it might have difficulty filling jobs. On the other hand, areas with larger or growing working-age populations may be more attractive to companies seeking to expand or relocate.\n\nAccording toMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, when Foxconn reached a deal with the state of Wisconsin in 2017 to open a plant in Racine County, it promised it would add 13,000 jobs by as early as 2022. By January 2019, Foxconn had backed away from that number, which had been one of many sources of criticism for the deal. Critics argued that the area did not have a large enough working-age population to fill 13,000 jobs in such a short period.\n\nUnderstanding a region's working-age population, and how it changes over time, matters because of what it indicates about that region's economic prospects. If the working-age population is declining over time, there will be fewer workers to fill future jobs as current workers retire. There will also be fewer workers to pay taxes and provide vital services in the public sector. If the working-age population is growing, the region will need to attract businesses to create new jobs for those workers.\n\nIf a region's population isagingoverall, that region's working-age population will decline. Businesses will struggle to fill jobs because there are fewer workers. Aging residents also require more resources, such as healthcare services and pension payments, but with fewer workers to support those costs.\n\nWorking-age population is different from thelabor force participation rate. The working-age population is those who, due to their age, are able and likely to work. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of the working-age population who are working or actively looking for work. Someone can be part of the working-age population but not working or seeking work, such as a parent who is staying home to care for young children.\n\nA region's working-age population is the total number of people in that area who are able and likely to work. This is based on an age range that is determined by that region's demographics and employment laws. Usually, the working age includes older teenagers to those of retirement age, such as those ages 18-64.\n\nThe working-age population does not measure those who are working, only those who are of the correct age to be able and likely to work. A region's working population measures the number of people who are employed, no matter their age. Some people outside of working age will be employed, such as younger teenagers or those who retire later. There will also be those who are included in the working-age population but are not working due to disability, illness, caregiving responsibilities, or other factors.\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel. \"Report: FoxconnMay Drop Manufacturing as Part of Drastic Rethinking of Racine County Campus.\"",
