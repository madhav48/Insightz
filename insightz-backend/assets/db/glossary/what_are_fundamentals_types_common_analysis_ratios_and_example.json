  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nFundamentals include the basic qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to the financial or economic well-being of a company, security,\u00a0or currency, and their subsequent financialvaluation. Wherequalitativeinformation includes elements that cannot be directly measured, such as management experience,quantitative analysis(QA) uses mathematics and statistics to understand the asset and predict its movements.\n\nIn business and economics, fundamentals represent the primary characteristics and financial data necessary to determine the stability and health of anasset. This data can includemacroeconomic, or large-scale factors, andmicroeconomic, or small-scale factors to set a value on securities or businesses.\n\nAnalysts and investors examine\u00a0these fundamentals to develop an estimate as to whether the underlying asset is considered a worthwhile investment, and if there is fair valuation in the market. For businesses, information such as profitability,revenue, assets,liabilities, and growth potential are considered fundamentals. Through the use of fundamental analysis, you may calculate a company'sfinancial ratiosto determine the feasibility of the investment.\n\nWhile fundamentals are most often considered factors that relate to particular businesses or securities, national economies, and their currencies also have a set of fundamentals that can be analyzed. For example, interest rates,gross domestic product(GDP) growth, trade balance surplus/deficits, and inflation levels are some factors that are considered to be fundamentals of a nation's value.\n\nMacroeconomic fundamentals are topics that affect an economy at large, including statistics regardingunemployment,supply and demand, growth, andinflation, as well as considerations for monetary or fiscal policy and international trade. These categories can be applied to the analysis of a large-scale economy as a whole or can be related to individual business activity to make changes based on macroeconomic influences. Large scale, macroeconomic fundamentals are also part of thetop-down analysisof individual companies.\n\nMicroeconomic fundamentals focus on the activities within smaller segments of the economy, such as a particular market or sector. This small-scale focus can include issues of supply and demand within the specified segment, labor, and both consumer and firm theories.Consumer theoryinvestigates how people spend within their particular budget restraints. Thetheory of the\u00a0firmstates that a business exists and makes decisions to earn profits.\n\nBy looking at the economics of a business, including the overall management and thefinancial statements, investors are looking at a company's fundamentals. Not only do these data points show the health of the business, but they also indicate the probability of further growth. A company with littledebtand sufficient\u00a0cash is considered to have strong fundamentals.\n\nStrong fundamentals suggest that a business has a viable framework or financial structure. Conversely, those with weak fundamentals may have issues in the areas of debt obligation management, cost control, or overall organizational management. A business with strong fundamentals may be more likely to survive adverse\u00a0events, like economicrecessionsordepressions, than one with weaker fundamentals. Also, strength may indicate less risk should an investor consider purchasing securities associated with the businesses mentioned.\n\nInvestors and financial analysts are interested in evaluating the fundamentals of a company to compare its economic position relative to its industry peers, to the broader market,\u00a0or to itself over time. Fundamental analysis involves digging deep into a company's financial statements to extract its profit and growth potential, relative riskiness, and to ultimately decide if its shares are over, under,\u00a0or fairly valued in the market.\n\nOften fundamental analysis involves computing and analyzing ratios to make apples-to-apples comparisons. Some common fundamental analysis ratios are listed below.\n\nFundamental analysis should be carried out with a holistic approach, utilizing several ratios and including a bottom-up as well as a top-down analysis to come to specific conclusions and actions.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, large-cap tech companies Microsoft and Apple had similar market caps for the first time since 2010. Although the two companies had similar market caps of about $850 billion, they had very different fundamentals. For example, Microsoft was trading at 45Xearningswhile Apple was trading at 15X earnings.\n\nAlso, while Microsoft\u2019s earnings were predicated on software as a service (SaaS) and software sales, Apple\u2019s were still primarily dependent on hardware sales. Apple\u2019s revenue base is about 2\u00bd times Microsoft\u2019s; the global market for its devices is far more saturated than the global market for Microsoft\u2019s software.\n\nThough both companies had a similar market cap, they had very different fundamentals, which would need to be considered when choosing them as potential investments, particularly in determining future growth prospects.\n\nThe main difference relies on the scale of the subjects that the fundamentals are applied to. Macroeconomic fundamentals include the broad trends that have implications for the global economy, seen as a whole, like GDP, inflation, unemployment, growth, and international trade. Microeconomics fundamentals are those factors that affect smaller segments of the economy, such as a particular market, sector, or entity. For example, supply/demand, labor, and price levels within a specific segment.\n\nQuantitative analysis applies mathematics and statistics and uses hard data and numbers. Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, involves elements that cannot be measured or expressed as a number. It can include features that are subjective and opinions.\n\nInvestors can use fundamental analysis to get insights into a company's value, risk, and growth potential, and thus make informed decisions.\n\nFundamentals refer to the qualitative and quantitative information that reflects a company's financial and economic position.\n\nFundamental analysis refers to the process of looking at the key ratios of a business (revenue, assets, liabilities, etc.) to draw conclusions on its growth potential and how financially healthy and profitable it is.\n\nMarketWatch. \"Microsoft Surpasses Apple as Most valuable U.S. Company.\"\n\nMarketWatch. \"Opinion: Apple is the New Microsoft, and That's bullish For the Stock.\"",
