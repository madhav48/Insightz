  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA zero balance account (ZBA) is exactly what it sounds like: a checking account in which a balance of $0 is maintained. When funds are needed in the ZBA, the exact amount of money required is automatically transferred from a central or master account. Similarly, deposits in these accounts are swept into a master account daily.\n\nCorporations sometimes use zero balance accounts to ensure funds are readily available throughout different departments, eliminate excess balances in separate accounts, and maintain greater control over thedisbursementof funds. These accounts often handle items such as payroll, petty cash, and other needs.ZBAs aren't usually used by individual consumers.\n\nThe master account provides a centralized place to manage an organization's funds. Whenever funds are required in the ZBAchecking accountto cover a charge or transaction, money is transferred from the master account in the exact amount required.An employee does not need to do this manually, as the process is fully automated.\n\nThe ZBA's activity is limited to the processing of payments instead of maintaining a running balance.\n\nUsing a ZBA to funddebit cardsissued by the organization helps ensure that all card activity is pre-approved. Becauseidle fundsaren't present within the ZBA, running a debit card transaction is impossible until funds are supplied to the account.\n\nUsing a ZBA as a spending control mechanism is especially helpful when managingincidental chargesacross a large organization. By limiting quick access to funds via debit cards, proper approval procedures are more likely to be followed prior to the completion of a purchase. This permits easy tracking of transfers and reconciliation across accounts.\n\nTransactions from ZBAs are self-managed, often saving the account holder time from not having to manually rebalance or fund transactions. ZBAs may also be easier to reconcile, audit, or receive department-level reporting on spending.\n\nBecause so much of ZBAs is automated, many companies find there are fewer clerical errors or transaction failures due to human error, which saves on overdraft fees. ZBAs are also great control mechanisms to monitor spending. If a company has one main account instead of many accounts with bank balances, it can mitigate the chance of its bank account being compromised by unapproved or fraudulent transactions.\n\nZBAs maximize funds available for corporate investment and minimize the risk of overdraft fees.\n\nBy concentrating funds in the master account, more money is available for investments rather than having small dollar amounts idle within a variety of subaccounts. The master account often has additional benefits, such as a higherinterest rateon balances.\n\nThere are some downsides to ZBAs. Although sweeping and transfers are automatic, the business must still reconcile bank statements and monitor for failed transactions. Should a transaction fail to process or be canceled, money moved into that account may automatically be swept back, resulting in multiple unnecessary transactions. Last, while intended to relieve administrative burdens, ZBAs proliferate the number of bank accounts a company owns and may result in higher administrative demands.\n\nNot everyone can qualify for a ZBA. Banks often do not offer this product to general consumers and only offer this solution to companies. In addition, banks may not provide ZBAs to small, unestablished businesses.\n\nBy their nature, ZBAs must have a linked master account, and the bank offering the ZBA will likely require the master account to be held at their institution. The bank may also require transaction history evidence, historical average bank balances, estimated spend projections, and applicable credit history information prior to opening the account.\n\nAlthough ZBAs don't often have cash balances, those balances are usually insured (up to certain limits) by both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).\n\nAn organization may have multiple zero balance accounts to improvebudget managementand make the process of allocating funds more efficient. This can include creating a separate ZBA for each department or function as a way to monitor daily, monthly, or yearly charges.\n\nOther reasons for creating separate ZBAs might involve the financial management of particular short-term projects or those at particular risk for unexpected overages. The use of zero balance accounts helps to prevent excess charges without proper notification and approval.\n\nA zero balance account, or ZBA, is a bank account that intentionally carries a $0 balance. A company only funds the account when items need to be paid, and any remaining cash after deposits is often swept at the end of the night. A zero balance account relies heavily on a master account to sweep its money.\n\nIn the context of the financial product, a zero balance account isn't bad. A company intentionally holds $0 in the account and only puts money into it when a transaction will occur. A company does this to strategically manage cash and protect its assets.\n\nZero balance accounts are often only offered to businesses. In addition, a business must usually have been operating for some time and have credit history, banking history, and proof of futurecash flowprior to opening a ZBA.\n\nA zero balance account automatically sweeps funds from a master account to pay obligations or sweeps unused funds into a master account. The account is intended to increase cash efficiency, limit risk andfraud, and streamline the banking process.\n\nA zero balance account (ZBA) is a business checking account with a balance of $0. When funds are needed in the ZBA, the exact amount of money required is automatically transferred from a central or master account. Deposits are also swept back into the master account daily.\n\nCorporations sometimes use zero balance accounts to ensure funds are easily available across different departments, remove excess balances in separate accounts, and keep greater control over the disbursement of funds. These accounts often handle payroll,petty cash, and similar needs. ZBAs aren't usually offered to individual consumers.\n\nCitizens Business Bank. \"Zero Balance Account (ZBA).\"\n\nThomson Reuters Practical Law. \"Zero Balance Account.\"",
