  "term": "What Is the Demographic Dividend, and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "Demographic dividend refers to the growth in aneconomythat results from a change in the age structure of a country\u2019s population. This is typically brought on by a decline in fertility and mortality rates.\n\nDemographic dividends occur in countries that see declines in both fertility and mortality rates. A country that experiences low birth rates in conjunction with low death rates receives an economic dividend or benefit from the increase in productivity of the working population that ensues. As fewer births are registered, the number of young dependents grows smaller relative to theworking population. With fewer people to support and more people in thelabor force, an economy\u2019s resources are freed up and invested in other areas to accelerate a country's economic development and the future prosperity of its populace.\n\nTo receive a demographic dividend, a country must go through a demographic transition where it switches from a largely rural agrarian economy with high fertility and mortality rates to an urban industrial society characterized by low fertility and mortality rates. In the initial stages of this transition, fertility rates fall, leading to a labor force that is temporarily growing faster than the population dependent on it. All else being equal,per capita incomegrows more rapidly during this time too. This economic benefit is the first dividend received by a country that has gone through the demographic transition.\n\nWhile most countries have seen an improvement in child survival rates, birth rates remain high in many of them, particularly in lesser developed countries. These countries, therefore, rarely enjoy an economic benefit known as the demographic dividend.\n\nA decline in fertility and mortality rates boosts working population productivity, which leads to a demographic dividend.\n\nThe first dividend period generally lasts for a long time\u2014typically five decades or more. Eventually, however, the reduced birth rate reduces labor force growth. Meanwhile, improvements in medicine and better health practices lead to an ever-expanding elderly population, sapping additional income and putting an end to the demographic dividend. At this stage, all else being equal, per capita income grows at a decelerated rate and the first demographic dividend becomes negative.\n\nAn older working population facing an extended retirement period has a powerful incentive to accumulate assets to support themselves. These assets are usually invested in both domestic and international investment vehicles, adding to a country'snational income. The increase in national income is referred to as the second dividend which continues to be earned indefinitely.\n\nThe benefits gotten from a demographic transition is neither automatic nor guaranteed. Any demographic dividend depends on whether the government implements the right policies in areas such as education, health, governance, and the economy. In addition, the amount of demographic dividend that a country receives depends on the level of productivity of young adults which, in turn, depends on the level of schooling, employment practices in a country, timing, and frequency of childbearing, as well as economic policies that make it easier for young parents to work. The dividend amount is also tied to the productivity of older adults which depends on tax incentives, health programs, and pension and retirement policies.\n\nThere are four main areas where a country can find demographic dividends:\n\nWhile many countries may experience changes in age structure, such shifts alone do not guarantee a demographic dividend.\n\nIn fact, it's not uncommon for countries to see a decline in birth and mortality rates without experiencing any economic growth. Critically, adequate work opportunities must be available to match the expanded capacity of a growing work force.\n\nThe continent of Africa has some of the highest population growth rates. In South Sudan, the population growth rate is 4.65%, followed by Niger at 3.66%, and Angola at 3.33%.\n\nDemographic dividends are driven by a confluence of factors, rather than a single explanation. However, integral to a demographic dividend is an increase in the productivity of the working population. Typically, this is caused by a lower birth rate\u2014reducing the proportion of a total population that consists of dependents\u2014as well as a lower mortality rate\u2014increasing the working age population.\n\nDemographic dividend is economic growth that results from a shift in a country's age structure. This typically occurs when fertility and mortality rates fall, thereby expanding the working population. Demographic dividends can increase savings, expand the workforce, increase human capital, and drive growth.\n\nCIA World Factbook. \"Population Growth Rate.\"",
