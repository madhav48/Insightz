  "term": "Unified Payments Interface (UPI): Definition and How It Works",
  "definition": "A Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a smartphone application that allows users to transfer money between bank accounts. It is a single-window mobile payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time a customer initiates a transaction.\n\nThe Unified Payments Interface is a real-time payment system. It is designed to enable peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers through a single two-click factor authentication process. The interface is regulated by theReserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank. It works by\u00a0transferring money between two bank accounts along with\u00a0a mobile platform.\n\nThe system is said to be a safe and secure method of transferring money between two parties and eliminates the need to transact with physical cash or through a bank. The pilot system was launched in India on April 11, 2016. Banks across the country started to upload their interface in Aug. 2016.\n\nUPI uses existing systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and\u00a0Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), to ensure seamless settlement across accounts. It facilitates push (pay) and pull (receive) transactions and even works forover-the-counteror barcode payments, as well as for multiple recurring payments such as utility bills, school fees, and\u00a0other subscriptions.\n\nIn 2021, $940 billion was transacted over UPI, and in 2022, the average monthly transaction count was more than six billion.\n\nOnce a single identifier is established, the system\u00a0allows mobile payments to be delivered without the use of credit or debit cards, net banking, or any need to enter account details. This would not just ensure greater safety of sensitive information, but connect people who have bank accounts viasmartphonesto carry out hassle-free transactions.\n\nOverall, UPI implies fewer cash transactions and potentially reduces theunbankedpopulation.\n\nSending money on the UPI is called a \"push.\"\u00a0In order to send money, the user logs into the interface and selects the Send Money/Payment option. After entering the recipient's virtual ID and the amount desired, they choose the account from which the money will be debited. The user then enters a specialpersonal identification number (PIN)and receives a confirmation.\n\nReceiving money through the system is called a \"pull.\"\u00a0Once the user has logged in to the system, they select the option to collect money. The user then needs to enter the virtual ID for the remitter, the amount to be collected, and the account in which they will deposit the funds. A message then goes to the payer with the request to pay. If they decide to make the payment, they enter their UPI PIN to authorize the transaction.\n\nOnce the transfer has been completed, both the sender and the recipient receive a confirmation by text message to their smartphones.\n\nA number of key features are offered by UPI. Users can access balances and transaction histories along with sending and receiving money. To send money, users need an account number, the Indian Financial System Code (or IFSC, which is an alphanumeric code that facilitates electronic transfers), the mobile number of the recipient, and a virtual ID or Aadhaar number (which is like a Social Security number).\n\nYes, UPI is available in the U.S. You are able to send money to India from the U.S. using UPI. You need the UPI ID of the receiver and can use a variety of banking apps, such as Wise, World Remit, and Remitly.\n\nThe UPI systems that you can use in India consist of many banking/payment apps that allow you to use UPI. These include PhonePe, Google Pay, Axis Pay, and BHIM.\n\nYes, UPI is safe in India. It is regulated by India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.\n\nThe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India is a regulated smartphone tool that allows for mobile payments to be made without debit or credit cards. The UPI has made paying for transactions easier and simpler, facilitating economic movement within the country.\n\nNPCI. \"Unified Payments Interface (UPI).\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \u201cDigitalization of Public Finance and Digital Public Infrastructure: Opportunities and Challenges.\u201d",
