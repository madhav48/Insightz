  "term": "What Is an Open Market Economic System, and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "An open market is an economic system with little to no barriers to free-market activity. An open market is characterized by the absence of tariffs, taxes, licensing requirements,subsidies, unionization, and any other regulations or practices that interfere with free-market activity. Open markets may have competitivebarriers to entry, but never any regulatory barriers to entry.\n\nIn an open market, the pricing of goods or services is driven predominantly by the principles of supply and demand, with limited interference or outside influence from\u00a0large conglomerates or governmental agencies.\n\nOpen markets go hand in hand withfree tradepolicies, which are designed to eliminate discrimination\u00a0against imports and exports. Buyers and sellers from different economies may voluntarily trade without a government applying tariffs,quotas, subsidies, or prohibitions on goods and services, which are considerable barriers to entry in international trade.\n\nAn open market is considered highly accessible\u00a0with few, if any, boundaries\u00a0preventing a person or entity from participating. The U.S. stock markets are considered open\u00a0markets because\u00a0any investor can participate, and all participants are offered the same prices; prices only vary based on shifts in supply and demand.\n\nAn open market\u00a0may have competitive barriers to entry. Major market players might have an established and strong presence, which makes it more difficult for smaller or newer companies to penetrate the market. However, there are no\u00a0regulatory barriers to entry.\n\nAn open market is the opposite of a closed market\u2014that is, a market with a prohibitive number of regulations constraining free market activity. Closed markets may restrict who can participate or allow pricing to be determined by any method outside of basic supply and\u00a0demand. Most markets are neither truly open nor indeed closed but fall somewhere between the two extremes.\n\nThe U.S., Canada, Western Europe, and Australia\u00a0are relatively open markets\u00a0while Brazil, Cuba, and North Korea are relatively closed markets.\n\nA closed market,\u00a0which is also called aprotectionistmarket,\u00a0attempts to protect its domestic producers from international competition.\u00a0In many Middle Eastern countries, foreign firms\u00a0can only compete locally if their business has a \"sponsor,\" which is a native entity or citizen who owns a certain percentage of the business.The nations that adhere to this rule are not considered open relative to other countries.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, several foreign companies compete in the generation and supply of electricity; thus, the United Kingdom has an open market in the distribution and supply of electricity.TheEuropean Union (EU)believes\u00a0that free trade can only exist when businesses can fully participate. Therefore, the EU ensures that its members have\u00a0access to all markets.\n\nThe CIA World Factbook. \"Field Listing: Economic Overview.\"\n\nYoussef, Moustafa Haj and Teng, Da. \"Market Entry Strategies in the Middle East: Unveiling the Sponsorship Strategy.\"International Studies of Management and Organization, vol. 51, no. 3, August 2021, pp. 253-275.\n\nOfgem. \"Wholesale Market Indicators,\" Select \"Chart: Wholesale electricity generation market shares by company in 2022 (GB).\"",
