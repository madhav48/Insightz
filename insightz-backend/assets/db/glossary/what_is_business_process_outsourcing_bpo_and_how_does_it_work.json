  "definition": "Investopedia / Michela Buttignol\n\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO) is a method ofsubcontractingvarious business-related operations to\u00a0third-partyvendors.\n\nOriginally used in manufacturing to manage supply chains, BPO now spans various industries, including healthcare, asset management, energy, pharmaceuticals, e-commerce, and others, to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and leverage specialized expertise and advanced technology.\n\nMany businesses, from small startups to large companies, opt tooutsourcevarious processes due to the availability of innovative services in today's highly competitive and dynamic business environment.\n\nBroadly speaking, companies adopt BPO practices in the two main areas ofback-officeandfront-officeoperations. Back-office BPO involves contracting its core business support operations, such as accounting, payment processing, IT services, human resources, regulatory compliance, and quality assurance, to outside professionals who ensure smooth business operations. This approach may see the business leverage technological trends like cloud computing and AI, which improve efficiency and quality while reducing costs.\n\nBy contrast,\u00a0front-office BPO tasks commonly include customer-related services such as\u00a0tech support, sales,\u00a0and marketing. These services help businesses improve customer experience and maintain a competitive edge in the market.\n\nThe global business process outsourcing market was valued at $281 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.6% from 202 to 2030.\n\nA business's range of BPO options depends on whether it contracts its operations domestically or internationally.\n\nBPO is considered\"offshore outsourcing\" when the contract is sent to another country that offers political stability, lower labor costs, or tax savings. One example is a U.S. company using an offshore BPO vendor in Singapore.\n\n\"Nearshore outsourcing\" refers to contracting work to a neighboring country. For example, a U.S. company partnering with a BPO vendor in Canada falls under this category.\n\nA third option, \"onshore outsourcing\" or \"domestic sourcing,\" occurs when BPO is contracted within the company\u2019s country, even if the vendor is in a different city or state.\n\nBPO is often called information technology-enabled services (ITES) because it relies on technology and infrastructure that enables external companies to perform their roles efficiently.\n\nCompanies are often drawn to BPO for its ability to provide greater operational flexibility. By outsourcing non-core and administrative functions, businesses can reallocate time and resources to core competencies like customer relations and product innovation, gaining an edge over competitors in their industry.\n\nBPO also grants access to cutting-edge technological resources that might otherwise be out of reach. BPO partners continuously adopt the latest technologies and practices to improve their processes.\n\nThe U.S.corporate income taxis one of the highest in the developed world and could rise further with Biden\u2019s proposal to increase the federal corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28%. Consequently, outsourcing to countries with lower taxes and labor costs becomes an effective cost-reduction strategy for American companies.\n\nBPO also offers companies the benefits of quick and accurate reporting,\u00a0improved productivity, and the\u00a0ability to swiftly reassign its resources when necessary.\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal to raise the federal corporate income tax rate from 21% to 28% would increase the United States\u2019 combined state and federal corporate tax rate to 32%. This change would make the U.S. corporate tax rate nearly 50% higher than the OECD average.Consequently, outsourcing operations to countries with lower taxes and labor costs would become a more attractive cost-reduction strategy for businesses.\n\nWhile BPO offers many advantages, it also has drawbacks. A business that outsources its business processes may be prone todata breachesor communication issues that delay project completion. Additionally, businesses often underestimate the ongoing costs of BPO providers.\n\nAnother potential downside is customer backlash if outsourcing is perceived as compromising quality or negatively impacting domestic employment.\n\nBPO is a highly lucrative field: The estimated total pay for a Business Process Outsourcing professional in the United States is $205,756 per year, with an average salary of $125,808 per year.\n\nBPO is the abbreviation for business process outsourcing, which refers to when companies outsource business processes to a third-party (external) company. The primary goal is to cut costs, free up time, and focus on core aspects of the business. Two types of BPO are front-office and back-office. Back-office BPO entails the internal aspects of a business, such as payroll, inventory purchasing, and billing. Front-office BPO focuses on activities external to the company, such as marketing and customer service.\n\nThere are numerous advantages to BPO. One of the primary advantages is that it lowers costs. Performing a certain job function internally costs a specific amount. BPO can reduce these costs by outsourcing this job to an external party, often in a less cost-intensive country, reducing the overall cost of performing that job function.\n\nOther advantages include allowing a company to focus on core business functions that are critical to its success rather than administrative tasks or other aspects of running a company that are not critical. BPO also helps with growth, particularly in global expansion. If a company is interested in opening an overseas branch or operating overseas, utilizing a BPO company that has experience in the local industry and speaks the language is extremely beneficial.\n\nThere are three primary types of BPO companies. These are local outsourcing, offshore outsourcing, and nearshore outsourcing. Local outsourcing is a company in the same country as your business. Offshore outsourcing is a company that's in another country, and nearshore outsourcing is a company that's in a country not too far from your own.\n\nA BPO call center manages incoming and outgoing customer calls for other businesses. It employs agents who can handle customer complaints or inquiries for multiple companies, often within a specific industry. For example, a call center agent may provide tech support for different vendors or manufacturers.\n\nBusiness process outsourcing (BPO) utilizes third-party specialists to carry out some part of a business process or operation (as opposed to outsourcing the entire production). BPO can lower a company's costs, increase efficiency, and provide flexibility. At the same time, the BPO industry is rapidly growing, which means that in our increasingly global economy, process outsourcing isn't going anywhere.\n\nIBM. \"What Is Business Process Outsourcing (BPO)?\"\n\nGrand View Research. \"Business Process Outsourcing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Service Type(Customer Services, Finance & Accounting), By Outsourcing Type, By Deployment, By End-use (IT and Telecommunication, BFSI), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2030.\"\n\nGrand View Research. \"Business Process Outsourcing Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Service Type(Customer Services, Finance & Accounting), By Outsourcing Type, By Deployment, By End-use (IT and Telecommunication, BFSI), By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2024 - 2030.\"\n\nCato Institute. \"President Biden Would Make the US a Tax Rate Outlier.\"\n\nGlassdoor. \"How Much Does a Business Process Outsourcing Make?\"",
