  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA 401(k) plan is atax-advantagedretirement savings plan.\n\nNamed after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, the 401(k) is adefined-contribution planprovided by an employer.The employer may match employee contributions; with some plans, the match is mandatory.\n\nThere are two major types of 401(k)s: traditional andRoth. With a traditional 401(k), employee contributions arepretax, meaning they reduce taxable income, but withdrawals in retirement are taxed. But with a Roth 401(k), employee contributions are made with after-tax income. There\u2019s no tax deduction in the contribution year, but withdrawals\u2014qualified distributions\u2014are tax free.\n\nBelow, you'll find detailed information on how 401(k) plans work, how to start one, and strategies for making the most of a plan.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to know when making any decision about your 401(k) is to use it. In a perfect world, you put the maximum amount in it,but at a minimum, you should contribute up to the point where your company matches what you put in,\u201d saidPeter Lazaroff, financial advisor and chief investment officer at Plancorp.\n\nIn 2023 (the most recent data), Americans saved an average of 7.1% of their salaries in their 401(k)s, which was higher than the overall personal savings rate that year.Less than 12% of working-age Americans were on track in 2023 to max out their contributions.The401(k) employee contribution limitfor 2025 is $31,000 (including\u201ccatch-up\u201d contributions) for those 50 and older and $23,500 for those under 50 (the limits in 2024 are $30,500 and $23,000, respectively).\n\nTraditional 401(k) plans were introduced in the early 1980s, allowing employees to make pretax contributions from their salaries up to certain limits.\n\nWhen a worker signs up for a 401(k), they agree to deposit a percentage of each paycheck directly into an investment account. Employers often match part or all of that contribution.\n\nEmployees choose the specific investments held within their 401(k) accounts from a selection offered by their employer. Typically, investment offerings include stock and bondmutual fundsandtarget-date fundsdesigned to reduce the risk of losses as the employee approaches retirement.\n\nAn employee\u2019s account holdings may include guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer\u2019s own stock.\n\nWith a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are deducted fromgross income. This means the money comes from your paycheck before income taxes have been deducted.\n\nAs a result, your taxable income is reduced by the total contributions for the year and can be reported as a tax deduction for that tax year. No taxes are due on the money contributed or the investment earnings until you withdraw the money, usually in retirement.\n\nWhen 401(k) plans were first rolled out in the 1980s, companies and their employees had one choice: the traditional 401(k).Roth 401(k)s didn't arrive until 2006.These 401(k) plans are named for former U.S. Senator William Roth of Delaware, the primary sponsor of the 1997 legislation that made the Roth IRA possible.At first, Roth 401(k)s caught on slowly, but now many employers offer them.\n\nWith a Roth 401(k), contributions are deducted from your after-tax income. This means you contribute from your pay after income taxes have been deducted. As a result, there is no tax deduction in the year of the contribution. When you withdraw the money during retirement, though, you don\u2019t have to pay any additional taxes on your contribution or on the investment earnings.\n\nAs a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lowermarginal tax bracketafter they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break.\n\nEmployees anticipating a higher tax bracket after retiring might choose a Roth 401(k) to avoid paying taxes on their savings later. This decision could be especially worthwhile if the Roth has many years to grow, as all the money earned by the contributions over decades will be tax free upon withdrawal.\n\nAs a practical matter, a Roth reduces your immediate spending power more than a traditional 401(k) plan\u2014something to consider if your budget is tight.\n\nEven though contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax money, there are, generally speaking, tax consequences if withdrawals are made before you\u2019re 59\u00bd years old. Always check with an accountant or qualified financial advisor before withdrawing money from either a Roth or traditional 401(k).\n\nOrder your copy of Investopedia\u2019sWhat to Do with $10,000 magazinefor more wealth-building advice.\n\nTraditional and Roth 401(k) plans are defined contribution plans. Both the employee and employer can contribute to the account up to the dollar limits set by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\nThe maximum amount an employee or employer can contribute to a 401(k) plan is adjusted periodically to account forinflation, which measures rising prices.\n\nFor 2025, the annual limit on employee contributions to a 401(k) is $23,500 for workers under age 50 (for 2024, the limit is $23,000). In addition, those age 50 or older can make a $7,500 catch-up contribution.\n\nThere is a limit on total employee and employer contributions for the year:\n\n\u201cEven though everyone has different circumstances, in general, you should try to put in the maximum allowable amount in your 401(k),\u201d says Peter Lazaroff, an Investopedia100 top financial advisor.\n\nEmployers who match employee contributions use various formulas to calculate that match.\n\nAn employer might match $0.50 for every $1 that the employee contributes, for example, up to a certain percentage of their salary. Vanguard estimates that about one in seven companies have 401(k) matching contributions that follow this formula on 6% of their employees\u2019 wages.\n\nLazaroff, who hosts the investment education podcast The Long Term Investor, says that you should take advantage of your employer\u2019s matching contributions if you can.It\u2019s a risk-free way to grow your money and not leave part of your compensation on the table.\n\n\u201cMeeting the match doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you have to sacrifice other financial goals, such as paying down debt or establishing an emergency fund,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can still chip away at debt and put away small amounts in an emergency fund if necessary. But securing that employer match is crucial.\u201d\n\nWhen you contribute to your 401(k) account, your money is invested according to your choices from the options your employer offers. These typically include an assortment of target-date funds and mutual funds.\n\nTarget-date funds are the way \u201cyou\u2019re least likely to make mistakes,\u201d Lazaroff said. These accounts contain a mix of stocks, bonds, and other securities that are adjusted as your chosen date approaches, generally shifting toward more conservative investments as you near retirement.\n\n\u201cYou might be different from the average, and you might accumulate enough wealth one day where a target-date fund isn\u2019t the most appropriate. But for many people, it\u2019s one of the easier and least risky routes to take,\u201d Lazaroff says.\n\nSeveral factors influence the pace and extent of your 401(k)\u2019s growth, including the amount you contribute annually, any company matches, investment performance, and the time until you retire.\n\nA significant benefit of a 401(k) is tax-deferred growth. With a traditional 401(k), you don\u2019t have to pay taxes on investmentgains, interest, ordividendsuntil you withdraw money from the account. However, if you have a Roth 401(k), you won\u2019t have to pay taxes on qualified withdrawals when you retire, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars.\n\nOpening a 401(k)also allows your money to grow over time, thanks to the power ofcompounding. Compounding occurs when the returns generated by your savings are reinvested into the account, generating returns of their own. Over many years, the compounded earnings in your 401(k) account can exceed the amount you contributed. This is why, as you continue to contribute to your 401(k), it can grow quite substantially by the time you retire.\n\nOnce your money goes into a 401(k), it can be difficult to withdraw it without paying taxes on the amount.\n\n\u201cMake sure that you still save enough on the outside for emergencies and expenses you may have before retirement,\u201d says\u00a0Dan Stewart, the head of Dallas-based Revere Asset Management. \u201cDo not put all of your savings into your 401(k) where you cannot easily access it, if necessary.\u201d\n\nEarnings in a 401(k) account are tax deferred for traditional 401(k) accounts and tax free for Roth accounts. When you withdraw from a traditional 401(k), that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed as ordinary income. With a Roth, you\u2019ve already paid income tax on the money you contributed, so you won\u2019t owe taxes on withdrawals if you satisfyspecific requirements.\n\nYou must be at least 59\u00bd\u2014or meet IRS criteria for ahardship withdrawal\u2014when you start making withdrawals, or you will face a 10% early withdrawal penalty on top of any other income tax you owe.\n\nSome employers allow employees to take out a loan against their 401(k) plan contributions, essentiallyborrowing from themselves.\n\nTraditional 401(k) account holders haverequired minimum distributions (RMDs)after reaching a certain age orface an IRS penalty. (Withdrawals are called distributions in IRS parlance.)\n\nInvestors who have retired must start takingRMDs from their 401(k) plansat age 73. The amount of the RMD is calculated based on yourlife expectancyat the time. Before 2020, the RMD age was 70\u00bd. Before 2023, it was 72.It was updated to age 73 in the omnibus spending bill H.R. 2617 in 2022.\n\nOne of the big advantages of a traditional 401(k) plan is that it lets youreduce your tax burdenwhile saving for retirement. With a Roth 401(k), qualifying withdrawals are tax free. And not only do you get tax-deferred gains, but it\u2019s also hassle free because contributions are automatically subtracted from your paycheck. What\u2019s more, your employer might provide a match, boosting your retirement savings.\n\nHowever, a 401(k) can come with fees\u2014though they\u2019re typically modest. Traditional (not Roth) accounts are subject to RMDs. There are penalties for withdrawing funds early\u2014if you\u2019re younger than 59\u00bd and you don\u2019t qualify for a hardship withdrawal, you\u2019ll need to pay a 10% penalty to the IRS. And a 401(k) might not be enough on its own to sustain you in retirement, depending on your goals and circumstances. Consider talking to a financial professional who can walk you through other options.\n\nSince it\u2019s difficult to predict what tax rates will be decades from now, many financial advisors suggest putting money into both Roth and traditional 401(k) accounts.\n\nThe United States has undergone a significant shift in how Americans save for retirement, as illustrated below by our chart comparing the number of Americans (in millions) in defined benefit anddefined contribution plans, along with the total for both.\n\nDefined contribution plans, most of which are 401(k)s, arean alternative to the traditional pension, known as a defined benefit plan. With a pension, the employer is committed to providing a specific amount of money to the employee for life during retirement.In recent decades, as the chart below shows, defined contribution plans like 401(k)s have become far more common, and traditional pensions have become rare as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to employees.\n\nAbove, the number of Americans in defined benefit and defined contribution plans, along with the total of both, in millions.\n\nInitially offered by employers to supplement other employee benefits, 401(k)s have become the most common private employer-sponsored retirement program in the U.S. About a third of working-age Americans have a 401(k), compared with one in nine who have a defined benefit pension plan.Meanwhile, U.S. Census data suggests that as many as four in 10baby boomersand half ofmillennialshave no retirement account at all.\n\nStill, the 401(k) plan was designed to encourage Americans to save for retirement. Among its benefits are tax savings. There are two main options, traditional and Roth, each with distinct tax advantages. If your employer offers both types of 401(k) plans, you can split your contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a Roth 401(k).\n\nBoth brokerage and 401(k) accounts are investment accounts, but they serve different purposes. A 401(k) is primarily for retirement savings, while a brokerage account can be used for various financial goals and often offers more control over the investments.\n\nA 401(k) is a type of qualified retirement plan. Within it, you can choose from a menu of investment options (generally mutual funds) where your money grows in a tax-advantaged manner.\n\nA brokerage account, meanwhile, is a private account where you can buy, sell, and hold whatever securities your broker has access to, including mutual funds, stocks, bonds, andexchange-traded funds (ETFs). Brokerage accounts are taxable, meaning that yourcapital gainsand dividends are subject to tax in the current period. There are also no contribution limits, early withdrawal considerations, or minimum distributions.\n\nLimited menu of investment options\n\nPotential for employer matching\n\nWhen you leave a company where you\u2019ve been employed and you have a 401(k) plan, you generally have four options:\n\nWithdrawing the money is usually a bad idea unless you urgently need it. The money will be taxable for the year it\u2019s withdrawn. You will be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless you are 59\u00bd or older, permanently disabled, or meet the other IRS criteriafor an exemption from the rule.\n\nFor a Roth 401(k), you can withdraw your contributions (but not any earnings) tax free and without penalty if you have had the account for at least five years or meet the IRS criteria mentioned previously.However, you\u2019re still decreasing your retirement savings, which you may regret later.\n\nMoving the money into anindividual retirement account (IRA)at a brokerage firm or a bank means avoiding immediate taxes and maintaining the account\u2019s tax-advantaged status. What\u2019s more, you can choose from among a wider range of investment choices than you had with your employer\u2019s plan.\n\nThe IRS has relativelystrict rules on rolloversand how they need to be accomplished. Not following them is costly.Typically, the financial institution in line to receive the money will help with the process to prevent any missteps.\n\nFunds withdrawn from your 401(k) must be rolled over to another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties.\n\nIn many cases, employers permit a departing employee to keep a 401(k) account indefinitely in their old plan, though the employee can\u2019t contribute further. This generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000. For smaller accounts, an employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere.\n\nLeaving the money where it is makes sense if the former employer\u2019s plan is well-managed and you are satisfied with its investment choices. The danger is that employees who change jobs throughout their careers can leave a trail of old 401(k) plans and may forget about one or more of them. Theirheirsmight also be unaware of the existence of the accounts.\n\nCapitalize, an investment platform specializing in rolling over forgotten or left-behind 401(k) accounts, estimates that in 2023, there were almost 30 million such accounts in the U.S., holding about a quarter of Americans\u2019 total assets in 401(k) plans.\n\nYou can usuallymove your 401(k) balanceto a new employer\u2019s plan.As with an IRA rollover, this maintains the account\u2019s tax-deferred status and avoids immediate taxes.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t comfortable with managing a rollover, you can leave some of the work to the new plan\u2019s administrator.\n\nThe maximum contribution to a 401(k) plan is $23,500 in 2025 if you are younger than 50 years old. If you are 50 years old or older, you can make an additional catch-up contribution of $7,500. There are also limitations on theemployer\u2019s matching contribution: The combined employer-employee contributions cannot exceed $70,000 in 2025 for employees under 50 (or $77,500 for employees 50 or older).\n\nTypically, no. There are few advantages totaking an early withdrawalfrom a 401(k) plan. If you withdraw before age 59\u00bd, you will face a 10% penalty in addition to any taxes you owe. However, some employers allow hardship withdrawals for sudden financial needs, such as certain medical costs, funeral costs, or buying a home.This can help you avoid the early withdrawal penalty, but you will still have to pay taxes on the withdrawal.\n\nA plunging stock market may seem worrisome, but it\u2019s almost always the right move to stay the course. Amid a big stock sell-off (abear market), stocks are essentially on discount, if you can weather some big emotions and ignore external pressures. Though the value of your 401(k) will dip as the market dips, it's likely that it won\u2019t forever\u2014or even for too long.\n\nA 401(k) plan is a workplace retirement plan that allows you to make annual contributions up to a specific limit and invest that money for your later years after your working days are over.\n\nThere are two major types of 401(k) plans: traditional or Roth. The traditional 401(k) involvespretax contributionsthat give you a tax break when you make them and reduce your taxable income. However, you pay ordinary income tax on your withdrawals. The Roth 401(k) involves after-tax contributions and no upfront tax break, but you won\u2019t pay taxes on your withdrawals in retirement. Both accounts allow employer contributions that can increase your savings.\n\nCorrection\u2014Aug. 25, 2024: This article has been corrected to explain when Roth 401(k) contributions can be withdrawn tax-free and without penalty.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plans Definitions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plans FAQs on Designated Roth Accounts.\u201d\n\nCapitalize. \u201cAverage 401(k) Account Contributions in 2023.\"\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cPersonal Saving Rate.\u201d\n\nStatista. \u201cConfidence in Progress Toward Retirement Goals for Individuals in the United States in 2023, by Respondent Type.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Limit Increases to $23,500 for 2025, IRA Limit Remains $7,000.\u201d\n\nU.S. Code. \u201c26 USC 401: Qualified Pension, Profit-sharing, and Stock Bonus Plans.\u201d\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \u201cWho Has Retirement Accounts?\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cRetirement Plans for Workers in Private Industry.\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority, via Internet Archive Wayback Machine. \u201cInvesting in Your 401(k).\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cSave the Date: Target-Date Funds Explained.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cOne-Participant 401(k) Plans.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Plan Overview.\u201d\n\nGuideline. \u201cEvolution of the 401(k).\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cAnother Retirement Savings Option: Roth 401(k) Plan.\u201d\n\nCongress.gov, U.S. Congress. \u201cS. 197\u2014Savings and Investment Incentive Act of 1997: Summary.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics\u2014Designated Roth Account.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c2025 Limitations Adjusted.\u201d\n\nVanguard. \u201cHow America Saves 2024.\u201d\n\nApple Podcasts. \u201cThe Long Term Investor.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201c401(k) Resource Guide\u2014Plan Participants\u2014General Distribution Rules.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRoth Comparison Chart.\u201d\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cTaxation of Retirement Income.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cConsidering a Loan from Your 401(k) Plan?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics\u2014Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Plan and IRA Required Minimum Distributions FAQs.\u201d\n\nCongress.gov, U.S. Congress. \u201cH.R.2617\u2014Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023: Text,\u201d Division T: Section 107.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cDefined Benefit Plan.\u201d\n\nCongressional Research Service Reports. \u201cA Visual Depiction of the Shift from Defined Benefit (DB) to Defined Contribution (DC) Pension Plans in the Private Sector.\u201d\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \u201cFAQs About Retirement Plans and ERISA,\u201d Page 2.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics\u2014Termination of Employment.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRollovers of Retirement Plan and IRA Distributions.\u201d\n\nCapitalize. \u201cThe True Cost of Forgotten 401(k) Accounts (2023).\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cRetirement Topics\u2014401(k) and Profit-Sharing Plan Contribution Limits.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cHardships, Early Withdrawals and Loans.\u201d",
