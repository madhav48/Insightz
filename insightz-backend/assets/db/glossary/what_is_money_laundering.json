Proxy servers and anonymous software make integration, the third component of money laundering, difficult to detect because money can be transferred or withdrawn with little or no trace of an internet protocol (IP) address.\n\nMoney can be laundered through online auctions and sales, gambling websites, and virtual gaming sites where ill-gotten money is converted into gaming currency and then back into real, usable, and untraceable \u201cclean\u201d money.\n\nLaundering may involvecryptocurrenciessuch asBitcoin.
