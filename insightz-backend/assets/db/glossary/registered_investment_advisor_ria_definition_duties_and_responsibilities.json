  "term": "Registered Investment Advisor (RIA): Definition, Duties, and Responsibilities",
  "definition": "A registered investment advisor (RIA) is a financial professional or firm that advises clients onsecuritiesinvestments and may manage their investment portfolios.\n\nA registered investment advisor (RIA) is a financial professional firm that advises clients on securities investments and may manage theirfinancial portfolios. RIAs are registered with either theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)or state securities administrators. RIAs have fiduciary obligations to their clients, which means they have a fundamental duty to always and only provide investment advice that is in the best interests of their clients.\n\nAs noted above, a registered investment advisor is a financial professional or financial services company that offers clients investment advice for a fee. They are governed by financialethicsthat compel them to act responsibly and in the best interests of their clients.\n\nThe rules on investment advisors were formulated by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. This law requires individuals or businesses that dispense professional investment advice to register with the SEC, although there are exemptions for smaller firms. Advisors might also be consideredqualified professional asset managers (QPAMs).\n\nInvestment advisors who manage a minimum of $25 million in assets are permitted, although not required, to register with the SEC. It becomes mandatory for firms that manage $100 million or more, as RIAs managing at least that amount are required quarterly to revealholdingsto the SEC.Investment advisors who manage smaller sums of investment money are typically required to register with state securities authorities.\n\nRIAs provide more services than just investment advice. Their services and advice may cover the following:\n\nRIAs must follow certain practices and procedures when furnishing advice to their clients. The table below highlights these responsibilities.\n\nRegistering as an RIA does not imply any recommendation or endorsement by the SEC or any otherregulator. It means only that the investment advisor has fulfilled all that agency\u2019s requirements for registration. Registering with the SEC requires disclosing information that includes the following:\n\nRIAs must update their information annually on file with the SEC, and the information must be made available to the public.\n\nAn RIA is a company that offers financial guidance to clients. Aninvestment advisor representative (IAR)is a person who gives financial advice. The RIA can have many employees, including several IARs, or it can be just one person who is both the RIA and the IAR. The IAR thus works for the RIA and provides the actual financial services to the clients.\n\nRIAs differ frombroker-dealersin essential ways. RIAs advise on all finance-related matters, including investments, taxation, and estate planning. Broker-dealers tend to focus more narrowly on facilitating purchases and sales of assets like stocks.\n\nRIAs are expected to act in a\u00a0fiduciary\u00a0capacity when they interact with their clients. Broker-dealers, on the other hand, are only required to satisfy the suitability standard. Clients of RIAs can be assured that their advisors always and unconditionally put their best interests first. Clients of broker-dealers need to be aware that the broker-dealer is permitted to dispense advice that is merely suitable for their client\u2019s investment portfolios.\n\nUnlike RIAs, broker-dealers are not required to disclose potential conflicts of interest or inform their clients about less expensive or more tax-efficient investment alternatives.\n\nThe following are some commonfeestructures for investment advisory firms:\n\nAlways do some careful research before selecting an investment advisor. You need a firm that is aligned with your interests and needs. An excellent source and starting point is theSEC\u2019s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website, which allows you to search for every RIA in the country.\n\nWhen choosing an RIA, you hire the financial firm you will be working with\u2014not necessarily an individual advisor (unless that's how they operate). Investment advisor representatives are the individuals who work for the RIA and directly provide advice to clients. An RIA may have just a single advisor or several IARs, each with its own areas of expertise and approach to investing.\n\nTherefore, when selecting an RIA, you're not just choosing a firm but potentially also among the individual IARs within that firm. Ensure that you understand the RIA's philosophy and standards and the specific skills and qualifications of the IAR who may be handling your portfolio.\n\nOnce you select those firms that fit your location requirements, you can review each firm\u2019s website andsocial mediafor information on the types of services offered, the registration, the representatives, and the total amount of money managed by the RIA.\n\nThe type and level of advice that RIAs provide can vary widely from firm to firm, so make sure the areas on which they focus fit your needs. This means that you shouldn't\n\nRIA firms are required to fileSEC Form ADV, which is the uniform form used by investment advisors to register with both the SEC and state securities authorities. The form, which should be offered to you by the firm in which you are interested, provides detailed information about the firm, from fees and client types to assets under management and more.\n\nTo check the record of an advisor, you have two major sources for information:\n\nSearch the total AUM of the firm in which you are interested by using the SEC\u2019s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure website and compare them with yours to see if your assets are on the low or high side for the firm. You can find this information directly on the company's website, its financial disclosure forms, or itsannual report.\n\nFirst, RIAs are legally obligated to act in your best interest. They also tend to provide\n\nmore personalized services. Since they aren't paid on commission, they don't have an incentive simply to deal with only when selling something. RIAs typically have transparent fee structures, often charging a percentage of assets under management or a flat fee, which aligns their interests with yours. Finally, most RIAs offer a broad range of financial planning services that address a wide range of needs.\n\nA firm can register as an RIA by filing Form ADV with the SEC. Within 45 days of the filing, the SEC must either grant registration or begin proceedings to deny it. In addition, RIAs are also required to abide by the \u201cbrochure rule,\u201d which requires them to inform clients with information about their practice, educational, and business backgrounds. RIAs must also maintain accurate books and records, subject to examination by the SEC.\n\nRIAs may register with the SEC if they manage at least $25 million in assets, and are required to do so if they manage more than $100 million. Investment advisers managing smaller amounts of money are typically required to register with state-level agencies.\n\nDemand for RIAs is growing, with the expectation that about a third of the market will be managed by RIAs by 2027.Although you don't need to work with one, if you decide to hire an RIA, that advisor doesn\u2019t even need to be human. You have a choice ofrobo-advisors\u2014automated software tools that dispense investment advice based on information about yourself and the investment preferences that you provide. The availability of this technology has further lowered the price of working with an RIA.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Division of Investment Management: Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Mid-Sized Advisers.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cForm ADV.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cGeneral Information on the Regulation of Investment Advisers.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cOrder Approving Adjustment for Inflation of the Dollar Amount Tests in Rule 205-3 Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.\u201d\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cHow To Register as an Investment Adviser.\u201d\n\nJ.D.
