The exchange changed its name to Oslo B\u00f8rs in the early 1900s.\n\nAs brokerage firms increased in popularity in Norway in the late 1990s, traders lost the need to meet in person to facilitate their transactions. As a result, the OSL went private, becoming alimited liability company (LLC)in 2001.The Oslo B\u00f8rs VPS Holding ASA, which was established as a result of themergerof the Oslo B\u00f8rs and VPS Holding, officially assumed ownership of the exchange in 2007.\n\nAs part of an effort for Nordic exchanges to attract more international investment, the Oslo Stock Exchange joined the NOREX alliance in 2000.
