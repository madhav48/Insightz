  "term": "What Is an Asset? Definition, Types, and Examples",
  "definition": "An asset can be anything that has a monetary value that produces income for its owner or that could produce income if used or sold.\n\nAn asset is a resource, tangible or intangible, that holds some monetary value that can be exploited by its owner. The asset may produce income, such as rental fees, or may produce a profit if sold, such as stocks or jewelry.\n\nFor an individual or a family, assets may include a home, savings, investments, and personal possessions that have intrinsic value.\n\nA company categorizes its assets as current assets, like inventory, which is intended for immediate use; fixed assets, like a factory and its equipment; financial assets, such as stock investments, and intangible assets, like goodwill.\n\nIndividuals usually think of assets as items of value that can be converted into cash at some future point and that might also be income-producing or appreciating in value until that time. They can be financial assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds or physical assets like a home or an art collection.\n\nAn asset may be something that has the potential to generate cash flow in the case of businesses. It might reduce expenses or improve sales regardless of whether it's atangible assetlike manufacturing equipment or a fleet of trucks or anintangible assetlike a patent or a trademark.\n\nA company must possess a right to the asset as of the date of its financial statements for it to be counted as one of its assets.\n\nAssets are reported on a company's balance sheet and can be broadly categorized into current or short-term assets,fixed assets, financial assets, or intangible assets.\n\nCurrent assetsare short-term economic resources that are expected to be converted into cash or consumed within one year. Current assets can include cash and cash equivalents,accounts receivable, physical inventory, and various prepaid expenses.\n\nCash is easy to value but accountants must periodically reassess the recoverability of inventory and accounts receivable. A receivable will be classified asimpairedif there's evidence that it might be uncollectible. Companies might have towrite offthose assets if inventory becomes obsolete.\n\nSome assets are recorded on companies' balance sheets using the concept ofhistorical cost. It represents the original cost of the asset when it was purchased by the company and it can also include expenses such as delivery and setup incurred to incorporate an asset into the company's operations.\n\nFixed assets are resources with an expected life of more than a year, such as plants, equipment, and buildings. An accounting adjustment known asdepreciationis made for fixed assets as they age. It allocates the cost of the asset over time. Depreciation may or may not reflect the fixed asset's loss of earning power.\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)allow depreciation under several methods. The straight-line method assumes that a fixed asset loses its value inproportion to its useful life. The accelerated method\u00a0assumes that the asset loses its value faster in its first years of use.\n\nWhat's considered useful life varies according to the type of asset. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assigns office furniture and fixtures a useful life of seven years under the general depreciation system (GDS). Cars and trucks have a useful life of five years.\n\nFinancial assetscan include stocks, corporate and government bonds, and other types of securities. They tend to beliquidunlike fixed assets and they're valued according to their current price on the relevant market.\n\nIntangible assets are economic resources that have no physical presence. They include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and goodwill. Intangible assets can beamortizedover their useful life for accounting and tax purposes similar to the depreciation process for fixed assets.\n\nAn asset is something of economic value that's owned or controlled by a person, a company, or a government. A liability is the opposite. It's something that's owed to another person, company, or government. Examples of liabilities include loans, tax obligations, andaccounts payable.\n\nAn asset is something of value that you own or that's owed to you. The loan would be an asset if you lent money to someone because they're obligated to repay you that amount. The loan would be a liability for the person who owes you the money.\n\nPersonal assets can include a home, land, financial securities, jewelry, artwork, gold and silver, or your checking account. Business assets can include motor vehicles, buildings, machinery, equipment, cash, and accounts receivable as well as intangibles like patents and copyrights.\n\nNon-physical or intangible assets provide an economic benefit even though you can't physically touch them. They're an important class of assets that includeintellectual propertysuch as patents or trademarks, contractual obligations, royalties, and goodwill.Brand equityand reputation are also examples of non-physical or intangible assets that can be quite valuable.\n\nNo. Labor is work carried out by human beings for which they're paid in wages or a salary. Labor is distinct from assets which are considered to becapital.\n\nAssets are categorized in accounting by their time horizon of use. Current assets are expected to be sold or used within one year. Fixed assets, also known asnoncurrent assets, are expected to remain in use for longer than one year. Fixed assets aren't easily liquidated so they can depreciate over time, unlike current assets.\n\nAssets are anything of value that an individual, a business enterprise, or another entity owns. Different types of assets are treated differently for tax and accounting purposes. Assets are generally a good thing to have and liabilities less so.\n\nMerriam-Webster. \"Current Assets.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 946 (2024), How to Depreciate Property.\"\n\nIFRS Foundation. \"IAS 38 Intangible Assets.\"",
