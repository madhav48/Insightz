Probate is the general administration of a deceased person'swillor the estate of a deceased person without a will.\n\nAnexecutoris commonly named in the will or an administrator, if there is no will, to complete the probate process. This involves collecting the deceased's assets to pay any\u00a0remaining liabilities on their estate and distributing the assets tobeneficiaries.\n\nProbate is the analysis and transfer administration ofestateassets previously owned by a deceased person. When a property owner dies, their assets are commonly reviewed by a probate court. This court provides the final ruling on the division and distribution of assets to beneficiaries. A probate proceeding will typically begin by analyzing whether or not the deceased person hasprovided a legalized will.\n\nIn many cases, the deceased person has established documentation, which contains instructions on how their assets should be distributed after death. However, in some cases, the deceased does not leave a will. There are special circumstances that occur with both situations that we've listed below.\n\nProbate law is the field of law that determines how an estate must be divided. Each state has its own laws and statutes requirements to determine if and how an estate must be probated. Common factors include:\n\nA deceased person with a will is known as a testator. When a testator dies, the executor is responsible for initiating the probate process. Theexecutoris typically a family member. The will can also provide details on a specified executor.\n\nThe executor is responsible for filing the will with the probate court. States can have different rules for the timeframe in which a will must be filed after death. Filing the will initiates the probate process. The probate process is a court-supervised proceeding in which the authenticity of the will left behind is proven to be valid and accepted as the truelast testamentof the deceased. The court officially appoints the executor named in the will, which gives the executor the legal power to act on behalf of the deceased.\n\nA will typically designate a legal representative or executor approved by the court. This person is responsible for locating and overseeing all the assets of the deceased. The executor has to estimate the value of the estate by using either the date of death value or the alternate valuation date, as specified by theInternal Revenue Code (IRC).\n\nMost assets that are subject to probate administration come under the supervision of the probate court in the place where the decedent lived at death. The exception is real estate. Probate for real estate may need to be extended to any county in which the real estate is located.\n\nThe executor also has to pay off any taxes and debt owed by the deceased from the estate.Creditorsusually have a limited amount of time (approximately one year) from the date of death to make anyclaims against the estatefor money owed to them. Claims that are rejected by the executor can be taken to court where a probate judge will have the final say on whether or not the claim is justified.\n\nThe executor is also responsible for filing the final, personalincome tax returnson behalf of the deceased. Anyestate taxesthat are pending can also come due within one year from the date of death. After the inventory of the estate has been taken, the value of assets calculated, and debts paid off, the executor will then seek authorization from the court todistribute whatever is left of the estate to the beneficiaries.\n\nIf a deceased person\u2019s estate is insolvent, which means that their debts outweigh their assets, an administrator will likely choose not to initiate probate. In general, individual states may have their own rulings on astatute of limitationsfor the processing of a will through probate. States can also have thresholds for probate filings.\n\nTrust funds can be orchestrated to pass immediately to designated inheritors upon death.\n\nWhen a person dies without a will, he is said to have died intestate. Anintestate estateis also one where the will presented to the court has been deemed to be invalid. The probate process for an intestate estate includes distributing the decedent\u2019s assets according to state laws. If a deceased person has no assets, probate may not be necessary.\n\nIn general, a probate court proceeding usually begins with the appointment of anadministratorto oversee the estate of the deceased. Theadministrator functions as an executor, receiving all legal claims against the estate and paying off the outstanding debts.\n\nThe administrator is tasked with locating any legal heirs of the deceased, including surviving spouses, children, and parents. Theprobate courtwill assess what assets need to be distributed among the legal heirs and how to distribute them. The probate laws in most states divide property among the surviving spouse and children of the deceased.\n\nAsset transfer to the government is known asescheatment. States do typically have a timeframe for the claiming of any assets by an heir who may step forward.\n\nCommunity property laws can recognize both spouses asjoint property ownersin an intestate proceeding. In effect, the distribution hierarchy typically starts with the surviving spouse. If unmarried or widowed at the time of death, assets are usually divided among any surviving children. After a spouse and children are considered, other relatives may also be deemed appropriate for distribution.\n\nClose friends of the deceased will not normally be added to the list of beneficiaries under a state\u2019s probate laws for intestate estates. However, If the deceased had a joint account withright of survivorshipor owned property jointly with another, the joint asset would automatically be owned by the surviving partner.\n\nIf an individual has no will and no heirs, any remaining assets go to the state.\n\nIt is important to know whether a probate is required following the death of an individual. The probate process can take a long time to finalize. The more complex or contested the estate is, the more time it will take to settle and distribute theassets. The longer the duration, the higher the cost.\n\nProbating an estate without a will is typically costlier than probating one with a valid will. However,\u00a0the time and cost required of each are still high. Also, since the proceedings of a probate court are publicly recorded, avoiding probate would ensure that all settlements are done privately.\n\nDifferent states have different laws concerning probate and whether probate is required after the death of a testator. Some states have a specified estate value, which requires probate. For example, probate laws in Texas hold that if the value of the estate is less than $75,000, then probate may be skipped.\n\nIf an estate is small enough to bypass the probate process, then the estate\u2019s asset may be claimed using alternative legal actions, such as an affidavit. Typically, if a deceased person\u2019s debts exceed their assets, probate is not necessarily initiated and alternative actions may be taken.\n\nSome assets can bypass probate because beneficiaries have beeninitiated through contractual terms. Pension plans, life insurance proceeds,401k plans, medical savings accounts, and individual retirement accounts (IRA) that have designated beneficiaries will not need to be probated. Likewise, assets jointly owned with a right of survivorship can bypass the probate process.\n\nAnother popular way to bypass probate is throughthe use of a trust.\n\nOverall, minimizing costs associated with the probate process can be prudent. Accumulated expenses can include court fees, professional service hours, and administration costs. Having an easily authenticated will is one of the most common ways to quickly move through a probate process and efficiently distribute assets appropriately.\n\nThe cost of the probate process varies depending on your state and your lawyer. In some states, it is typical for lawyers to process estates for a flat or hourly fee. In others, they charge a percentage of the estate. You will also have to pay for any outstanding debts, court and filing fees, and the costs of notifying creditors about the probate process. In addition, you may also have to pay an inheritance tax. It is worth researching the probate costs for your state when you begin end-of-life planning.\n\nWhile probate laws vary from state to state, 18 states have adopted the Uniform Probate Code, which offers a standardized procedure for dividing a decedent's assets. The states that have adopted the UPC are Idaho, Alaska (1972), Arizona (1973), Colorado (1974), Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, New Mexico, Utah, Michigan, Maine, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, South Carolina, Hawaii, North Dakota, New Jersey, and Massachusetts.\n\nEach state has its own limit to determine how much an estate must be to go through the probate process. Smaller estates may be able to go through a simplified probate process, or simply have heirs claim assets by affidavit. In addition, some assets\u2014such as living trusts and 401(k) plans\u2014do not need to go through the probate process. Since the probate process is expensive, it is worth researching your state's probate rules during your end-of-life planning.\n\nProbate law deals with the rules that determine how a person's assets are divided after they die. Each state has its own rules for the probate process, depending on the size of the estate, the type of assets, and the presence of a will. Since the probate process can be expensive, it is worth researchingthe different ways to structure an estatein order to avoid it.\n\nMagnus Finance. \"Probate State by State Thresholds.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Form 706.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 559, Survivors, Executors, and Administrators.\"\n\nTexas Constitution and Statutes. \"Estates Code Title 2.
