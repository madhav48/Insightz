  "term": "Branch Accounting: Definition and How It Works",
  "definition": "Branch accounting is a bookkeeping system in whichseparate accountsare maintained for each branch or operating location of an organization. Typically found in geographically dispersed corporations,multinationals, and chain operators, it allows for greater transparency in the transactions,cash flows, and overall financial position and performance of each branch.\n\nBranch accounts can also refer to records individually produced to show the performance of different locations, with the accounting records actually maintained at the corporate headquarters. However, branch accounting usually refers to branches keeping their own books and later sending them to the head office to be combined with those of other units.\n\nIn branchaccounting, each branch (defined as a geographically separate operating unit) is treated as an individual profit or cost center. Its branch has its own account. In that account, it records such items as inventory,accounts receivable, wages, equipment, expenses such as rent and insurance, andpetty cash.\n\nLike anydouble-entrybookkeeping system, the ledger keeps a tally of assets and liabilities, debits and credits, and ultimately, profits and losses for a set period.\n\nTechnically speaking, in bookkeeping terms, the branch account is a temporary or nominal ledger account. It lasts for a designated accounting period. At the period's end, the branch tallies up its figures and arrives at ending balances, which are then transferred to the appropriate head office or head department accounts. The branch account is left with a zero balance until the accounting process begins all over again with the next accounting period or cycle.\n\nThere are several different methods for keeping branch accounts, depending on the nature and complexity of the business and the operational autonomy of the branch. The most common include:\n\nBranch accounting can also be used for a company's operating divisions, which usually have more autonomy than branches, as long as the division is not set up legally as asubsidiarycompany. A branch is not a separate legal entity, although it can (somewhat confusingly) be referred to as an \"independent branch\" because it keeps its own accounting books.\n\nBranch accounting doesn't apply to departments, which typically are all in the same physical location, even if they have their own accounts. By contrast, a branch is in a different geographic location, and is a separate entity.\n\nBranch accounting is a common practice for businesses that operate in different geographic locations.\n\nThough it may seem synonymous with contemporary chain stores and franchise operations, branch accounting actually goes back a long way. Venetian banks maintained a form of it as early as the 14th century. The ledgers of a firm of Venetian merchants, dating from around 1410, also show a form of it to try to account for overseas and home accounts. Luca Pacioli's \"Summa de Arithmetica\"(1494), the first accounting textbook, devotes a chapter to it.\n\nBy the 17th century, branch accounting was being widely used by German counting-houses and other businesses. Moravian settlements throughout the 13 original American colonies used it for their books in the mid-1700s.\n\nThe primary advantages (and often, the objectives) of branch accounting are betteraccountabilityand control since the profitability and efficiency of different locations can be closely tracked.\n\nOn the downside, branch accounting may involve added expenses for an organization in terms of manpower, working hours, and infrastructure. A separate account coding structure must be maintained for each operating unit. It may be necessary to appoint branchaccountantsto ensure accurate financial reporting and compliance with head office procedures and processes.\n\nBranch accounting is used in many industries, but it tends to be practiced in corporations that have geographically dispersed branches, such as business chains and multinational corporations.\n\nBranch accounting can use different methods depending on the nature and complexity of the business and how autonomously the branch operates. Some common methods include the debtor system, the income statement system, the stock and debtor system, and the final accounts system.\n\nBecause branch accounting allows a business to closely track the profitability and efficiency of each branch location, it can provide better financial accountability and control.\n\nBranch accounting is a useful bookkeeping practice in businesses that have branches or geographically disparate operating locations. It maintains separate accounts for each location to allow for greater monitoring, transparency, and accountability over the financial transactions and performance. Branch accounting differs from departmental accounting in that departments tend to operate from the same physical location.\n\nAccountingTools. \"Branch Accounting Definition.\"\n\nStuDocu. \"Branch Accounting Methods.\"\n\nGary D.
