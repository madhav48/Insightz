  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA death benefit is a payout to the beneficiary of alife insurancepolicy, annuity, or pension when the insured person or annuitant dies. With life insurance policies, death benefits are not usually subject to income tax and named beneficiaries typically receive the death benefit as a lump-sum payment.\n\nA death benefit is a payment made to a beneficiary of a contract such as a life insurance policy after the insured person dies. It may also be paid as a result of an annuity or pension.\n\nWith life insurance, the amount of the death benefit is set in the terms of the contract and is chosen by the policyholder, who makes regularpremiumpayments. The amount of the premium payments will increase as the amount of the death benefit increases. Generally, the younger and healthier you are, the lower your premiums.\n\nBuying a life insurance policy with a death benefit can provide peace of mind that your loved ones will receive financial support after your death.\n\nTypes of death benefits with insurance policies include all-cause death benefits, accidental death benefits (ADB), and accidental death and dismemberment benefits (ADDB). Let\u2019s look at each type of death benefit in more detail.\n\nUnder the contract with the insurance company or other company, a death is guaranteed to be paid to the listedbeneficiaryor beneficiaries,as long as premiums are paidwhile the insured or annuitant is alive.\n\nDeath benefits of life insurance policies are commonly issued as a lump-sum payment in the full amount of the benefit. Another option that beneficiaries may have is to accept the death benefit in installments, such as quarterly or monthly, in a fixed amount until the proceeds are depleted or for a set period of time.\n\nBeneficiaries may alsohave the optionof receiving an annuity that makes payments in installments for life in an amount determined by the insurer. Or they may opt to take onlyinterestpayments and then eventually pass on the proceeds to another beneficiary.\n\nSome insurers offer a retained asset account in which the insurance company acts as a bank holding the proceeds and the beneficiary can make withdrawals.\n\nFor an insurer to issue a death benefit, it will likely require a completed claim form along with copies of the contract and a death certificate.\n\nProceeds paid through life insurance or annuity death benefits avoidprobate, which can provide the benefit faster. Probate is a legal process in which a will is reviewed to determine if it\u2019s valid. However, for most policies and accounts, if the policyholder does not name a beneficiary, the insurer pays the proceeds to the estate of the insured, which may be probated.\n\nDeath benefits from life insurance policies are generally not subject to ordinary income tax, whileannuitybeneficiaries may pay income tax on death benefits. Death benefits from pensions are treated differently from benefits from life insurance policies, and they may be subject to taxation.\n\nWhile life insurance death benefits paid in a lump sum are not subject to ordinary income tax, if the beneficiary receives the death benefit in installments that include interest, then the interest will be taxable. And if the death benefit goes to your estate, it may besubject to federal or state estate taxif the estate exceeds theestate tax exemptionamount.\n\nThe process of receiving a death benefit from a life insurance policy, pension, or annuity is straightforward.\n\nFirst, beneficiaries need to know which life insurance company holds the deceased\u2019s policy or annuity. The policyholder has a responsibility to share policy or annuity information with beneficiaries when they name them as beneficiaries.\n\nOnce the insurance company is identified, beneficiaries must complete a death claim form, providing the insured\u2019s policy number, name,Social Security number, date of death, and payment preferences for the death benefit proceeds.\n\nBeneficiaries must submit death claim forms to each insurance company with which the insured or annuitant carried a policy, along with a copy of the death certificate. Most insurers require a certified death certificate listing the cause of death. If multiple beneficiaries or survivors are listed on a policy or annuity, each one must complete a death claim form.\n\nDeath benefits under a life insurance policy are not subject to ordinary income tax, but they may be subject to federal or state estate tax if the death benefit is paid to the estate and exceeds the estate tax exemption limit. Beneficiaries of an annuity with a death benefit may pay income tax on the payments.\n\nTry to find out from the policyholder whether or not you\u2019re named as a beneficiary\u2014don\u2019t rely on the insurance company to tell you. You can request information from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners\u2019Life Insurance Policy Locator Serviceabout whether you are a beneficiary on a life insurance policy. To claim a benefit, beneficiaries must submit death claim forms with a copy of a death certificate to insurers.\n\nSome annuity contracts allow you to name a beneficiary to inherit remaining annuity payments. Typically, a beneficiary reports annuity income as the plan participant would have included it as gross income, but they may exclude an amount equal to the deceased employee\u2019s payments toward the contract.\n\nDeath benefits are designed to provide funds to beneficiaries so they can receive financial support following the death of the insured. A death benefit can help offset the expenses of funeral services or provide money for necessary life expenses, among other purposes.\n\nIf you are naming beneficiaries in a contract or inheriting a death benefit, consider consulting a financial professional to guide you through your options for your specific situation.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 525: Taxable and Nontaxable Income.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 575: Pension and Annuity Income.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cInstructions for Form 706.\u201d",
