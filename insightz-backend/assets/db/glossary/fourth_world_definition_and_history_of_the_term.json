  "term": "Fourth World: Definition and History of The Term",
  "definition": "The Fourth World is an outdated term used to describe the\u00a0most underdeveloped, poverty-stricken, and marginalized regions of the world.\n\nMany inhabitants of these nations do not have any political ties and are often hunter-gatherers that live in nomadic communities, or are part of tribes.\u00a0They may be fully functional and self-surviving but during the Cold War were ascribed\u00a0Fourth World status based on their economic performance.\n\nDuring the Cold War, each country was classed as belonging to a certain type of world, a position that has since evolved as these classifications have evolved. The First World was used to describe countries whose views aligned with NATO andcapitalism, theSecond Worldreferred to countries that\u00a0supportedcommunismand the Soviet Union and the Third World referenced the nations that were not actively aligned with either side.\u00a0These countries included impoverished former European colonies and all the nations of Africa, the Middle East, Latin America, and Asia.\n\nThe term Fourth World was born later as an extension of the developing Third World to describe places and populations characterized by extremely lowincome per capitaand limited natural resources.\n\nFourth World nations consisted of those excluded from mainstream society. For example, the Aboriginal tribes in South America or Australia\u00a0are entirely self-sufficient but do not participate in the globaleconomy. These tribes can function free from any assistance from others but, from a global standpoint, were considered to be Fourth World nations. Fourth World nations do not contribute or consume anything on the global scale and are unaffected by any global events.\n\nPolitical borders did not define Fourth World areas. In many cases, they were defined as\u00a0nations\u00a0without sovereign status,\u00a0emphasizing\u00a0instead the perceived non-recognition and exclusion of ethnically\u00a0and religiously\u00a0defined peoples from the politico-economic world system, such as the\u00a0First Nations\u00a0groups throughout North, Central, and South America.\n\nThe term Fourth World was believed to have been first used in Canada by\u00a0Mbuto Milando, the first secretary of the\u00a0Tanzanian\u00a0High Commission, in a conversation with\u00a0George Manuel, Chief of the National Indian Brotherhood (now the\u00a0Assembly of First Nations). Milando stated that \"When native peoples come into their own, on the basis of their own cultures and traditions, that will be the Fourth World.\"\n\nThe term\u00a0became synonymous with stateless, poor,\u00a0and marginal nations following the publication of Manuel'sThe Fourth World: An Indian Realityin\u00a01974.Since 1979, think tanks, such as the\u00a0Center for World Indigenous Studies,\u00a0have used the term to define\u00a0the relationships between ancient,\u00a0tribal, and non-industrial nations and modern political nation-states.\n\nIn 2007, theUnited Nations(UN)\u00a0Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) was introduced to promote \"minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world.\u201dSince then, communications and organizing among\u00a0Fourth World peoples\u00a0accelerated in the form of international treaties fortrade, travel, and security.\n\nCenter for World Indigenous Studies. \"Fourth World Journal Summer 2023.\"\n\nManue, George and Posluns, Michael. \"The Fourth World: An Indian Reality.\"University of Minnesota Press, 2018.\n\nCenter for World Indigenous Studies. \"Our Story.\"\n\nUnited Nations. \"United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.\"",
