  "term": "Roth IRA: What It Is and How to Open One",
  "definition": "Part of a series of articles to help you open a Roth IRA and invest for retirement\n\nA Roth IRA is a type of tax-advantagedindividual retirement accountto which you can contribute after-tax dollars toward your retirement. Known as an individual retirement arrangement by the IRS, the primary benefit of a Roth IRA is that your contributions and the earnings on those contributions can grow tax-free and be withdrawn tax-free after age 59\u00bd, assuming the account has been open for at least five years. In other words, you pay taxes on money going into your Roth IRA, and then all future withdrawals are tax-free. The features of a Roth IRA account can vary between providers and you should compare thebest Roth IRA accountsbefore making a choice.\n\nRoth IRAs are similar totraditional IRAs, with the biggest distinction being how the two are taxed. Roth IRAs are funded with after-tax dollars. Unlike a traditional IRA, the contributions are not tax-deductible, but once you start withdrawing funds, the money you take out is tax-free.\n\nSubscribe to \"Term of the Day\" and learn a new financial term every day.

When you withdraw earnings once you retire at age 59\u00bd or later and after owning the Roth IRA for five years, you won't have to pay any further taxes. You can withdraw contributions without tax or penalty at any time.\n\nA Roth IRA can be funded from a number of sources:\n\nAllRoth IRA contributionsmust be made in cash (which includes checks and money orders) unless they are rollover contributions.They can\u2019t be in the form of securities or property. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limits how much can be deposited annually in any type of IRA, adjusting the amounts periodically. The contribution limits are the same for traditional and Roth IRAs. These limits apply across all your IRAs, so even if you have multiple accounts you can't contribute more than the maximum.\n\nSimilar to other qualified retirement plan accounts, the moneyinvested in a Roth IRAgrows tax-free. However, a Roth IRA is less restrictive than other accounts. The account holder can maintain the Roth IRA indefinitely. There are norequired minimum distributions (RMDs)during their lifetime, as there are with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs.\n\nConversely, traditional IRA deposits are generally made with pretax dollars. You usuallyget a tax deduction on your contributionand pay income tax when you withdraw the money from the account during retirement.\n\nOnce you have contributed money to a Roth IRA, you can put it to work by investing in a variety of securities, includingmutual funds, stocks, bonds,exchange-traded funds (ETFs), certificates of deposit (CDs), and money market funds.\n\nProhibited investmentsinclude life insurance, collectibles, coins (except certain coins minted by the U.S. Treasury), and S-corp stock. \u201cThere is no rule against investing your IRA in Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency,\" Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com, told Investopedia.\n\nIf you want the broadest range of investment options, you need to open a Rothself-directed IRA (SDIRA), a special category of Roth IRA in which the investor, not the financial institution, manages their investments. These unlock a universe of possible investments, including directly investing in digital assets.\n\n\u201cRoth IRAs that can hold cryptocurrency, as well as other unusual assets, are typically available through certain self-directed IRA custodians,\" said Eric Satz, founder and chief executive of Alto, a self-directed IRA platform that provides access to alternative assets. Those specialized self-directed custodians are equipped to manage the unique custody and compliance requirements associated with cryptocurrency investments and provide access to the 24x7 liquidity markets as expected by most crypto investors.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the standard investments (stocks, bonds, cash,money market funds, and mutual funds), you can hold assets that aren\u2019t typically part of a retirement portfolio in such self-directed Roth IRAs. Some of these include gold, investment real estate, partnerships, and tax liens\u2014even a franchise business.\n\nBut just because you\u2019re allowed to invest in cryptocurrency does not make it a good idea. In a traditional IRA, cryptocurrency can generate distributions that get taxed a short-term ordinary income, Slott said. That entails a higher tax rate than long-term capital gains.\n\nEqually bad, if the IRA owner is under age 59\u00bd, an additional 10% early distribution penalty can apply, Slott said.\n\n\u201cCrypto makes more sense in a Roth IRA,\" Slott said. \"With Roth IRAs, if the holding rules are followed, any earnings can be distributed tax-free. If a crypto investment appreciates significantly, that could be a substantial tax-free windfall for a Roth IRA owner\u2019s golden years.\n\n\u201cNevertheless, there are serious concerns that must be addressed when it comes to investing an IRA in crypto. First, IRA owners cannot contribute crypto to an IRA. They must contribute cash. Then the crypto would be purchased within the IRA. Additionally, investments in cryptocurrency face the same issues that other alternative IRA investments encounter. Most IRA custodians will limit available investment choices to firm-approved stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and CDs.\u201d\n\nSo your IRA custodian\u2014the Fidelitys and Vanguards of the investment world\u2014could bar digital assets from your Roth or traditional IRA.\n\nThe maximum annual contribution that an individual can make to a Roth IRA in 2024 and 2025. People age 50 and older can contribute up to $8,000.\n\nARoth IRA must be established with an institutionthat has received IRS approval to offer IRAs. These include banks,brokerage companies, federally insured credit unions, and savings and loan associations. Generally, individuals open IRAs with brokers.\n\nARoth IRA can be establishedanytime. However,contributions for a tax yearmust be made by the IRA owner\u2019s tax-filing deadline, which is normally April 15 of the following year.\n\nTwo basic documents must be provided to the IRA owner when an IRA is established:\n\nThese provide an explanation of the rules and regulations under which the Roth IRA must operate, and they establish an agreement between the IRA owner and the IRA custodian/trustee.\n\nNot all financial institutions are created equal. Some IRA providers have an expansive list of investment options, while others are more restrictive. Almostevery institution has a different fee structurefor Roth IRAs, which can have asignificant impact on investment returns.\n\nYour risk tolerance and investment preferences will play a role in choosing aRoth IRA provider. If you plan on being an active investor and making lots of trades, you want to find a provider that has lower trading costs.On the other hand, certain providers charge you an account inactivity fee if you leave your investments alone for too long. Some providers have morediverse stock or ETF offeringsthan others; it all depends on what type of investments you want in your account.\n\nPay attention to the specific account requirements as well. Some providers have higher minimum account balances than others. If you plan on banking with the same institution, see if your Roth IRA account comes with additional banking products. If you\u2019re looking atopening a Roth IRAat a bank or brokerage where you already have an account, see whether existing customers receive any IRA fee discounts.\n\nMost IRA providers offer only regular IRA (traditional or Roth) accounts. For a self-directed IRA, you\u2019ll need a qualified self-directed IRA custodian who specializes in that type of account, which allows assets beyond the typical stocks, bonds, ETFs, and mutual funds.\n\nIf your account is located at a bank, be aware that IRAs fall under a different insurance category from conventional deposit accounts. Therefore, coverage for IRA accounts is not as robust. TheFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)still offers insurance protection up to $250,000 for traditional or Roth IRA accounts, but account balances are combined rather than viewed individually.\n\nFor example, if the same banking customer has a CD held within a traditional IRA with a value of $200,000 and a Roth IRA held in a savings account with a value of $100,000 at the same institution, then the account holder has $50,000 of vulnerable assets without FDIC coverage.\n\nThe IRS dictates not only how much money you can deposit in a Roth IRA but also the type of money that you can deposit. Basically, you can onlycontribute earned incometo a Roth IRA.\n\nFor individuals working for an employer, compensation that is eligible to fund a Roth IRA includes wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, and other amounts paid to the individual for the services that they perform. It\u2019s generally any amount shown in Box 1 of the individual\u2019s Form W-2. For a self-employed individual or a partner or member of apass-throughbusiness, compensation is the individual\u2019s net earnings from their business, less any deduction allowed for contributions made to retirement plans on the individual\u2019s behalf and further reduced by 50% of the individual\u2019sself-employment taxes.\n\nMoney related to divorce\u2014alimony, child support, or in a settlement\u2014can also be contributed if it is related to taxable alimony received from a divorce settlement executed prior to Dec. 31, 2018.\n\nSo, what sort of funds aren\u2019t eligible? The list includes:\n\nYou can never contribute more to your IRA than your earned income in that tax year.And as previously mentioned, you receive no tax deduction for the contribution\u2014althoughyou may be able to take a Saver's Tax Creditof 10%, 20%, or 50% of the deposit, depending on your income and life situation.\n\nAnyone who has earned income can contribute to a Roth IRA\u2014as long as they meet certain requirements concerningfiling statusandmodified adjusted gross income (MAGI).Those whose annual income is above a certain amount, which the IRS adjusts periodically, become ineligible to contribute.\n\nHere\u2019s how the system works: An individual who earns less than the ranges shown for their appropriate category can contribute up to 100% of their compensation or the contribution limit, whichever is less.\n\nIndividuals within the phaseout range must subtract their income from the maximum level and then divide that by the phaseout range to determine the percentage that they are allowed to contribute.\n\nThe table below shows the figures for 2024.\n\nThe table below shows the income qualifications for 2025.\n\nOne way that a couple can boost their contributions is with a spousal Roth IRA. An individual mayfund a Roth IRA on behalf oftheir married partner, who earns little or no income. Spousal Roth IRA contributions are subject to the same rules and limits as regular Roth IRA contributions. The spousal Roth IRA is held separately from the Roth IRA of the individual making the contribution, as Roth IRAs cannot be joint accounts.\n\nFor an individual to be eligible to make a spousal Roth IRA contribution, the following requirements must be met:\n\nAt any time during the tax year, you may withdraw contributions from your Roth IRA, both tax- and penalty-free. If you take out only an amount equal to the sum that you\u2019ve put in, then the distribution is not considered taxable income and is not subject to penalty, regardless of your age or how long it has been in the account.\n\nHowever, there\u2019s a catch when it comes to withdrawing account earnings\u2014any returns that the account has generated. For the distribution of account earnings to be considered aqualified distribution, it must occur at least five years after the Roth IRA owner established and funded their first Roth IRA, and the distribution must occur under at least one of the following conditions:\n\nWithdrawal of earnings may besubject to taxesand/or a 10% penalty, depending on your age and whether you\u2019ve metthe five-year rule. Here\u2019s a quick rundown.\n\nIf you meet the five-year rule:\n\nIf you don\u2019t meet the five-year rule:\n\nRoth IRA withdrawals are made on afirst in, first out (FIFO)basis\u2014so any withdrawals made come from contributions first. Therefore, no earnings are considered touched until all contributions have been taken out.\n\nA withdrawal of earnings that do not meet the above requirements is considered anon-qualified distributionand may be subject to income tax or a 10% early distribution penalty.There may be exceptions, however, if the funds are used:\n\nNote that if you withdraw only the amount of your contributions made within the current tax year\u2014including any earnings on those contributions\u2014then the contribution is reversed. For example, if you contribute $5,000 in the current year and those funds generate $500 in earnings, you can withdraw the $5,000 principal tax- and penalty-free and the $500 gain will be treated as taxable income.\n\nA special provision in theCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Actallowed taxpayers to take a coronavirus-related distribution from Jan. 1, 2020, to Dec. 31, 2020, up to an aggregate $100,000 from all qualified plans and IRAs. The coronavirus-related distribution could be taken by a qualified individual, defined by the IRS as someone who was negatively affected by coronavirus\u2014either financially or through a family diagnosis. Retirement plan owners who qualified for coronavirus-related distributions included those:\n\nThe special provision allowed the retirement account holder to take the distribution as a standard withdrawal with no repayment or as a loan with a repayment option. The distribution was exempt from the 10% early distribution penalty but was taxed as ordinary income. The CARES Act allowed the withdrawal to be taxed as ordinary income in full in 2020 or over a three-year period in 2020, 2021, and 2022. Those who took advantage of this provision had until the end of the third year to pay back the funds.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s assume that you withdrew $15,000 in 2020. You would need to claim $5,000 on your tax returns in 2020 and 2021. If you repaid the funds in full in 2022, then you would not have needed to pay taxes on the final $5,000. Additionally, you will need to file an amended return for 2020 and 2021 to recoup your taxes previously paid on the first two-thirds.\n\nWhether a Roth IRA ismore beneficial than a traditional IRAdepends on the tax bracket of the filer, the expected tax rate at retirement, and personal preference.\n\nIndividuals who expect to be in ahigher tax bracketonce they retire may find the Roth IRA more advantageous since the total tax avoided in retirement will be greater than the income tax paid in the present. Therefore, younger and lower-income workers may benefit the most from a Roth IRA.\n\nIndeed, by beginning to save with an IRA early in life, investors make the most of the snowballing effect ofcompound interest: Your investment and its earnings are reinvested andgenerate more earnings, which are reinvested, and so on.\n\nOf course, even if you expect to have a lower tax rate in retirement, you\u2019ll still enjoy a tax-free income stream from your Roth IRA. That\u2019s not the worst situation in the world.\n\nThose who don\u2019t need their Roth IRA assets in retirement can leave the money to accrue indefinitely andpass the assets to heirs tax-freeupon death. Even better, while thebeneficiarymust take distributions from an inherited IRA, they can stretch out tax deferral by taking distributions for a decade\u2014and, in some specialized cases, for their lifetimes\u2014if the Roth IRA\u2019s original owner died in 2020 or later.\n\nTraditional IRA beneficiaries, on the other hand, do pay taxes on the distributions. Also, a spouse can roll over an inherited IRA into a new account and not have to begin taking distributions until age 73.\n\nRoth IRAs inherited before 2020 can still use what\u2019s often called the stretch IRA strategy. That approach lets heirs \u201cstretch\u201d the inherited Roth IRA withdrawals over their lifetimes. That can allow the IRA to continue building up earnings tax-free, potentially for decades. However, the SECURE Act eliminated the stretch option for most beneficiaries except spouses.\n\nSome people open orconvert to Roth IRAsbecause they fear an increase in taxes in the future, and this type of IRA allows them to lock in the current tax rates onthe balance of their conversions. Executives and other highly compensated employees who are able to contribute to a Roth retirement plan through their employers\u2014for example, via a Roth 401(k)\u2014can also roll these plans into Roth IRAs with no tax consequence and then escape having to take mandatory minimum distributions when they turn 73.\n\nThere are many variables to consider whenchoosing a Roth IRAora 401(k) retirement account. Each type of account provides an opportunity for savings to grow tax-free. Roth IRAs do not provide tax advantages when you make a deposit, but you can withdraw tax-free during retirement. The same applies to Roth 401(k) accounts.\n\nThe reverse is true for regular or traditional 401(k)s. These types of accounts involve contributing a portion of your paycheck to a 401(k) prior to income tax deductions. And in terms of annual contribution limits, Roth IRAs are typically much lower than 401(k)s.\n\nAdditionally, 401(k)s allow employers to make matching contributions. On the flip side, 401k(s) often have higher fees, minimum distributions, and fewer investment options.\n\nIn 2024 and 2025, the maximum annual contribution amount for a Roth IRA is $7,000, or $583.33 monthly for those under age 50. This amount increases to $8,000 annually, or roughly $666.67 monthly, for individuals age 50 or older.\n\nThe only limit in any year is the annual one. We cite the monthly breakdown just to put the annual cap into a monthly perspective.\n\nIn comparison, the 2024 contribution limit for a regular or a Roth 401(k) account is $23,000 ($23,500 in 2025), and if you are age 50 or older, you can contribute an additional $7,500 as a catch-up contribution for both 2024 and 2025.\n\nWhile Roth IRAs do not include anemployer match, they allow for a greater diversity of investment options.For individuals who anticipate being in a higher tax bracket when they\u2019re older, thetax-free withdrawals of Roth IRAscan be beneficial.\n\nAlso, you can withdraw your Roth IRA contributions (but not earnings) at any time, tax- and penalty-free.Ultimately, you can manage how you want to invest your Roth IRA by setting up an account with a brokerage, bank, or qualified financial institution.\n\nAmong the disadvantages of Roth IRAs is the fact that, unlike 401(k)s, theydo not include an upfront tax break. Secondly, annual contribution limits are about a third of 401(k)s, and for some high-income individuals, contributions are either reduced or not allowed.\n\nA Roth IRA is an individual retirement account (IRA) that allows you to withdraw money (without paying a penalty) on atax-free basisafter age 59\u00bd and after you have owned the account for its five-year holding period. If you buy a home, pay for college, or need your Roth funds for the birth or adoption of a child, you can also withdraw without paying a penalty.\n\nRoth accounts are funded with after-tax money, so while you don't get the upfront tax break of a traditional IRA, you can withdraw your contributions without paying federal or state income tax on the amount after meeting the criteria for withdrawals.\n\nFor individuals who anticipate that they will be in a higher tax bracket when they are older or have retired, Roth IRAs can provide a beneficial option, as the money is not taxable if you\u2019ve met the time requirements, unlike withdrawals from a traditional 401(k) or traditional IRA.\n\nRoth IRA benefits are powerful. You can take tax- and penalty-free withdrawals once you are old enough and once you\u2019ve owned the account long enough. You are also exempt from penalty on withdrawals if you qualify. And you are in fact eligible if you take out no more than $10,000 to buy a first home, to name one legal loophole.\n\nAnother Roth IRA perk is the ability to pay an income tax rate that may be lower now on the money that goes into a Roth IRA than on money you withdraw years from now in retirement. That benefit hinges on your expectation coming true\u2013that you have a higher tax rate in retirement when you\u2019ve amassed more wealth.\n\nAll those points can be true. But that does not mean a Roth IRA is the only type of retirement savings account that you should have.\n\n\u201cHaving different types of accounts is advantageous because it gives you tax liability diversification,\u201d said Ed Slott, founder of IRAHelp.com.\n\nFor one thing, that diversification prevents you from putting all of your future income into one tax basket. That\u2019s even more valuable if a fickle Congress once again changes tax rules. After all, what if Congress kills or dilutes the tax-free pass that withdrawals from Roth IRA enjoy for now?\n\n\u201cWhat good is it to plan, sacrifice, and save if you don't know whether the government is going to just make unforeseeable changes and take money away from you?\" Slott said.\n\nFor another thing, what if your expectation of having a higher tax rate in retirement than you do now simply turns out wrong?\n\nFurther, other types of retirement savings accounts have benefits that Roth IRAs do not offer. To cite one big one, 401(k) accounts almost always give you a company match.\n\nThe purpose of theRetirement Security Rule, also known as the fiduciary rule, is to protect investors from conflicts of interest when receivinginvestment advicethat the investor uses for retirement savings.\n\nThe rule was issued by theU.S. Department of Labor (DOL)on Apr. 23, 2024. It takes effect on Sept. 23, 2024. However, a one-year transition period will delay the effective date of certain conditions to 2025.\n\nIf an advisor is acting as a fiduciary under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), they are subject to the higher standard\u2014the fiduciary best-advice standard rather than the lower, merely suitable advice standard. Their designation can limit products and services they are allowed to sell to clients who are saving for retirement.\n\nInvestopedia is dedicated to providing investors with unbiased, comprehensive reviews and ratings of online brokers and robo-advisors.
