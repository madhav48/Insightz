  "term": "What Is a Payout? Definition, How It Works, Types, and Examples",
  "definition": "Payouts refer to the expectedreturnsor disbursements from investments orannuities.\u00a0A payout may be expressed as a lump sum or on a periodic basis and as either a percentage of the investment's cost or in a real dollar amount.\n\nA payout can also refer to the period in which an investment or project is expected to recoup its initialcapital investmentand become minimally profitable. In this case, it is short for \"time to payout,\" \"term to payout,\" or \"payout period.\"\n\nIn terms of financial securities, such as annuities anddividends, payouts refer to the amounts received at given points in time. For example, in the case of anannuity, payouts are made to theannuitantat regular intervals, such as monthly or quarterly.\n\nThere are two main ways that companies can distribute earnings to investors:dividendsandshare buybacks. With dividends, payouts are made by corporations to their investors and can be in the form ofcash dividendsorstock dividends. Thepayout ratiois the percentage rate of income the company pays out to investors in the form ofdistributions. Some payout ratios include both dividends and share buybacks, while others only include dividends.\n\nFor example, a payout ratio of 20% means the company pays out 20% of company distributions. If company A has $10 million innet income, it pays out $2 million to shareholders.\n\nGrowth companiesand newly formed companies tend to have low payout ratios. Investors in these companies rely more on share priceappreciationfor returns than dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThe payout ratio is calculated with the following formula:\n\nThe payout ratio can also include share repurchases, in which case the formula is as follows:\n\nThe cash amount paid out to dividends can be found on thecash flow statementin the section about cash flows from financing. Dividends and stock repurchases represent an outflow of cash and are classified as outflows on the cash flow statement.\n\nThe term \"payout\" may also refer to the capital budgeting tool used to determine the number of years it takes for a project to pay for itself. Projects that take longer are considered less desirable than projects with a shorter period.\n\nThe payout, or payback period, is calculated by dividing the initial investment by the cash inflow per period. If company A spends $1 million on a project that saves $500,000 a year for the next five years, the payout period is calculated by dividing $1 million by $500,000. The answer is two, which means the project will pay for itself in two years.\n\nAnannuityhas two phases: anaccumulation phaseand a payout phase. During the accumulation phase, the annuitant deposits funds into the account so they can grow taxed-deferred until they are withdrawn. During the payout phase, which is often during retirement, the annuitant receives payments from the insurance company as income for the retiree. These payments are payouts.\n\nAn annuity payout can come in one of two forms: as a lump-sum payment, or as a payment that arrives at regular intervals, such as monthly, quarterly, or annually. With alife annuity, the payout phase will last until the annuitant dies, providing income with periodic payments for the rest of the annuitant's life. With ajoint and survivor annuity, the payouts continue for the duration of thebeneficiary's life, typically the surviving spouse.\n\nThis is not limited to annuities, however. If you have a pension, you may also have the option to choose between asingle-life payoutand a joint-and-survivor, orjoint-life payout. Typically joint-life payouts are smaller than single-life payouts, to account for the number of payments that will last the duration of the life of the beneficiary.\n\nTake a life annuity with an account balance of $2 million. A 6% payout rate would distribute $120,000 to the annuitant every year until their death. Divided into monthly payments, this would equal $10,000 per month.\n\nPayout, as a noun, is a sum of money that someone receives, either in a lump sum or on a regular basis. It's a payment.\n\nPaying out, as a verb, is the process of making a payment to a recipient.\n\nAccording to Merriam-Webster, \"payout\" is a noun that means \"the act of paying out,\" or \"payoff.\"\n\nA payout is typically what you receive as an investor as areturn on your investment.\n\nIt may come in the form of dividends or share buybacks or as a periodic distribution during retirement, such as from a pension or an annuity. With retirement income, you'll have to choose whether you want a single-life payout or a joint-life payout. With the former, the payouts stop when the recipient dies. With the latter, the payments stop when the beneficiary dies.\n\nA payout may also refer to a budgeting tool that is used to determine how long it will take for a project to pay for itself.\n\nA payout ratio describes how much income you receive as an investor as a distribution. It's something you might want to monitor, to assess not just how well your investments are doing, but what it will really mean for your bottom line.",
