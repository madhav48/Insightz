  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nEstablished in 1993, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority\u00a0(HKMA)\u00a0acts\u00a0to controlinflationand maintain the stability of the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) and of the banking sector through itsmonetary policy.\ufeff\ufeff The HKMA links the HKD to the U.S. dollar to help the HKD maintain a stable value.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHong Kong is a key finance capital for the People's Republic of China, and it's a place for multinational companies to set up operations.\u00a0As aSpecial Administrative Regionof the People's Republic of China, Hong Kong is an autonomous territory with its own currency and an annualnominal GDPof more than $365 billion as of 2019.\ufeff\ufeff The HKMA\u00a0acts as a de factocentral bankfor the region.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe HKMA\u00a0maintains asovereign wealth fundcalled the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Investment Portfolio.\ufeff\ufeff The HKMA is a member of the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks along with theReserve Bank of Australia, thePeople's Bank of China, theBank of Japan, and seven other central banks.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOne of the key roles of the HKMA\u00a0is maintaining currency stability. TheLinked Exchange Ratesystem is designed to\u00a0stabilize the exchange rate between the Hong Kong dollar (HKD) and the United States dollar (USD). Thefixed-rate exchange systemseeks to maintain parity with the USD within a tight range, allowing HKD\u00a0note-issuing banks to issue new banknotes only when\u00a0they deposit an equivalent value of U.S. dollars with the authority.\ufeff\ufeff The exchange rate tends to fluctuate within a set range. The HKMA\u00a0has one of the world's largest currency reserves in relation to its economy.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe authority operates theExchange Fund. The fund's primary objective \"to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong.\" The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial center.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe HKMA\u00a0is charged with promoting the stability and integrity of the financial system, including the banking system.\u00a0One of the key ways the authority does this is by buying HKD to maintainparitywith the dollar within the stated range.\ufeff\ufeff As of 2021, the\u00a0fixed-rate system has keptinterest ratesultra-low in Hong Kong, encouraging expansion and investment.\ufeff\ufeff But low-interest rates have also fueled a record home price boom in the territory, creating affordability problems.\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority. \"An Introduction to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority,\" Page 1.
