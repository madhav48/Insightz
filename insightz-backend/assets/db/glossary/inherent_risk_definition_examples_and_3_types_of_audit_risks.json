This is inherent risk\u2014the natural susceptibility offinancial statementsto errors or misstatements because of the complexity of transactions, the judgment required in accounting estimates, or the nature of the business itself.\n\nBusinesses, too, face inherent risks. For instance, a tech company developing the newest apps has more inherent risk than a corner grocery store simply because of the complexity involved. For this article, though, we focus on the inherent risks relating to financial statements.\n\nEvery financial statement has sections where misstatements are more likely to occur\u2014that's just the nature of accounting. Some transactions and account balances are inherently more susceptible to material misstatement than others. For example, calculatingdepreciationexpenses is trickier to audit accurately than simple cash transactions since you're dealing with estimates and technical accounting judgments.\n\nA common misconception is that just because a business seems \"easy to audit,\" it has a low inherent risk. For example, with a cash-heavy business, you might think, \"Well, we can verify the bank balance easily, so the risk must be low.\" But that's actually about audit evidence and controls, not inherent risk. The natural susceptibility of cash accounts to misstatement (inherent risk) is independent of these verification methods.\n\nThe level of inherent risk in financial statements may be influenced by the following:\n\nInherent risks are not just qualitative. If there's a high transaction volume and variety, inherent risk increases. In addition, one-off transactions typically carry more inherent risk than recurring, standardized ones.\n\nLet's look at how inherent risk typically appears in different financial statement areas and industries:\n\nFinancial services companies face high inherent risk in several key financial statement areas. For example, the valuation of complex financial instruments likederivativesand structured products involves multiple assumptions and complicatedfair valuecalculations. These inherently increase the risk of material misstatement before any controls are considered.\n\nIn addition, loan loss provisions require significant judgment about future economic conditions and borrower behavior, making them naturally susceptible to misstatement.\n\nManufacturing companies typically have a higher inherent risk in their inventory and cost accounting. The valuation of work-in-progress inventory involves complexcost accounting methodsand estimates. When manufacturers operate globally, they face additional inherent risks in areas like these:\n\nHealth care organizations face unique inherent risks in their revenue recognition and receivables. The complexity comes from the following:\n\nTechnology firms often have high inherent risk in several financial statement areas:\n\nLet's examine how inherent risk fits into the bigger picture with two other forms of audit risk:\n\nTogether, these three risks determine the overall audit risk. While they are independent, they can often build on one another. A higher inherent risk often leadsauditorsto implement more extensive testing procedures (reducing detection risk) and companies to establish stronger controls (reducing control risk).\n\nUnderstanding inherent risk helps auditors identify which financial statement areas need more attention, design appropriate audit procedures, determine the extent of testing needed, and focus on areas most susceptible to important misstatements.\n\nWhile strong internal controls can help mitigate risks, they don't change the underlying inherent risk in complex accounting areas like revenue recognition, fair value measurements, or significant estimates. Hence, auditors must first assess inherent risk independently of controls\u2014it forms the basis for how audits are done.\n\nJournal of Accountancy.\"Inherent Risk and SAS No. 145: New Concepts and Requirements.\"",
