As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nAn investment grade is a rating that signifies a municipal or corporate bond presents a relatively low risk ofdefault. Bond rating firms like Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P), Moody's, and Fitch use different designations, consisting of the upper- and lower-case letters \"A\" and \"B,\" to identify a bond's credit quality rating. \"AAA\" and \"AA\" (high credit quality) and \"A\" and \"BBB\" (medium credit quality) are considered investment grade.Credit ratingsfor bonds below these designations (\"BB,\" \"B,\" \"CCC,\" etc.) are considered low credit quality and are commonly referred to asjunk bonds.\n\nIndividuals and businesses are given credit ratings based on theircredit histories. Lenders use these ratings to decide whether they will do business with and extend credit to potential borrowers. Similarly, investments are given credit ratings that lenders and investors can use to determine whether they want to invest in them.\n\nGrades work just likecredit scoresfor consumers and companies. An investment grade credit rating indicates a low risk of a credit default, making it an attractive investment vehicle, especially for conservative investors. A speculative grade, on the other hand, is the opposite of an investment grade. This grade indicates that the investment comes with a greater degree ofrisk.\n\nRatings are given to investments by different agencies, including S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. How they are rated varies based on the agency. For instance:\n\nWe go into more detail on these ratings and their scales below.\n\nInvestors should note that U.S.government bonds, also known as Treasuries, are generally granted the highest possible credit quality rating. In the case of municipal and corporatebond funds, afund company'sliterature, such as its fund prospectus and independent investment research reports, reports an \"average credit quality\" for the fund's portfolio as a whole.\n\nIn August 2023, Fitch downgraded the credit rating for the United States, moving it from a AAA rating to AA+. The agency cited potential issues with the country's fiscal condition over the next three years because of the political climate. According to Fitch,\n\nFitch also stated that shocks to the economy related to tax cuts and increased government spending are raising thenational debt, which could be problematic for the country's ability to pay its bills.\n\nMany institutional investors have a rigid policy of limiting their bond investments solely to investment grade issues.\n\nInvestment grade issuer credit ratings are those rated at least BBB- (S&P, Fitch) or Baa3 (Moody's). The exact ratings depend on thecredit rating agency.\n\nInvestment grade credit ratings include:\n\nCompanies with any credit rating in this category boast a high capacity to repay their loans; however, those awarded a AAA rating stand at the top of the heap and are deemed to have the highest capacity of all to repay loans.\n\nThe next category down includes the following ratings:\n\nCompanies with these ratings are considered to be stable entities with robust capacities for repaying their financial commitments. However, such companies may encounter challenges during deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nThe bottom tier of investment grade credit ratings delivered by Standard and Poor's include:\n\nCompanies with these ratings are widely considered to be speculative grade and are even more vulnerable to changing economic conditions than the prior group. Nevertheless, these companies largely demonstrate the ability to meet their debt payment obligations.\n\nAccording to Moody's, investment grade bonds comprise the following credit ratings:\n\nThe highest-rated Aaa bonds possess the leastcredit riskof a company's potential failure to repay loans. By contrast, the mid-tier Baa-rated companies may still havespeculativeelements, presenting high credit risk\u2014especially those companies that paid debt with expected future cash flows that failed to materialize as projected.\n\nAs noted above, Fitch ratings are similar to those issued by S&P. Investment grade ratings are as follows:\n\nInvestors should be aware that an agencydowngradeof a company's bonds from \"BBB\"' to \"BB\" reclassifies its debt from investment grade to junk status. Although this is merely a one-step drop in credit rating, the repercussions can be severe.\n\nThe drop to junk status telegraphs that a company may struggle to pay its debts. The downgraded status can make it even more difficult for companies to source financing options, causing a downward spiral as costs of capital increase.\n\nHigh yield bonds are generally considered higher risk than investment grade bonds. High yield bonds, however, tend to offer a higher return\u2014to compensate for the higher risk of default of the issuer.\n\nInvestment grade is considered to be rated BBB- or higher for Fitch and S&P Global. Investment grade for Moody\u2019s is considered Baa3 or higher.\n\nBonds that are rated AAA have the highest possible rating. The issuers of these bonds have the highest creditworthiness and are expected to easily meet financial obligations. AAA bonds have the lowest risk of default.\n\nCredit ratings help banks, lenders, and financial institutions decide how likely consumers and businesses are to repay their debts using credit scores. Similarly, investors can determine whether to put their money into certain investments based on ratings by agencies like S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. The higher the grade, the safer the investment. Investments with lower ratings have a greater risk of default. Keep in mind that ratings can go up and down based on financial and economic conditions, so it's always a good idea to keep up-to-date with the news and your portfolio.\n\nFitch Ratings. \"Fitch Downgrades the United States' Long-Term Ratings to 'AA+' from 'AAA'; Outlook Stable.\"\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. \"Corporate Bond Market Trends, Emerging Risks and Monetary Policy.\" Page 13.\n\nS&P Global. \"S&P Global Ratings Definitions.\"\n\nMoody's Investor Service. \"What Is a Credit Rating?\"\n\nFitch Ratings. \"Rating Definitions.\"\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"What To Know Before Saying Hi to High-Yield Bonds.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Updated Investor Bulletin: the ABCs of Credit Ratings.\"",
