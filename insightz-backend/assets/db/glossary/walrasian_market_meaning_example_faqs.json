  "definition": "Clay Halton was a Business Editor at Investopedia and has been working in the finance publishing field for more than five years. He also writes and edits personal finance content, with a focus on LGBTQ+ finance.\n\nA Walrasian market is an economic model of a market process in which orders are collected into batches of buys and sells and then analyzed to determine a clearing price that will decide the market price. This is also referred to as acall market.\n\nThe Walrasian market was developed byLeon Walras. He developed the concept in response to a problem by French philosopher and mathematician Antoine Cournot. Cournot posited that it was not possible to demonstrate a state ofgeneral equilibriumin which there was equal supply and demand at the same time in all markets.\n\nThe Walrasian market model is used regularly in the financial markets. TheNew York Stock Exchange(NYSE) uses a similar process before the opening bell to determine opening prices. A specialist looks at all the collected orders for a particular security and selects the price that will clear the greatest number of trades. In fact, up until 1871, all trading on the New York Stock Exchange was executed in this fashion.\n\nWithin a Walrasian market,buy and sell ordersare grouped together and then carried out at specific times instead of executed one by one continuously. A Walrasian auctioneer gathers prices about orders and determines the final price. The auctioneer is expected to function in a market with complete and perfect information about orders.\n\nA Walrasian market differs from anauction market, in which buyers and sellers trade continuously. In auction markets, market forces determine the final price more directly, whereas the buyers and sellers in a Walrasian market do not have the last say on what the final price is in their trades.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury holds auctions for Treasury securities in order to finance government budget requirements.\n\nIn an auction market,\u00a0buyers enter\u00a0competitive bids\u00a0and sellers enter competitive offers simultaneously. The price at which a stock is traded is a representation of the highest price that a buyer is willing to pay and the lowest price that a seller is willing to accept. Matching bids and offers are then paired together and the orders are completed. Walrasian markets can be more helpful in markets where there are few buyers, sellers, and\u00a0shares\u00a0to trade.\n\nFor example, say these are the buy orders for Company A\u2019s stock:\n\nIn a Walrasian market, the buy orders are grouped together and executed at a price and time that\u00a0will clear most of those orders. In this case, that price might be $5.25.\u00a0Even though some of the parties are willing to buy or sell for $5.00, the price that clears most of the transactions is $5.25, and in a Walrasian market, that is the price at which the exchange's\u00a0market\u00a0analyst\u00a0executes these trades.\n\nAn economic theory, Walras's Law states that excess supply in one market must be matched with excess demand in another market so that both factors negate one another. The law states that a specific market must be in equilibrium if all markets are in equilibrium.\n\nWalras's General Equilibrium theory seeks to show that all markets tend towards equilibrium in the long run as opposed to partial equilibrium, where only some markets in an economy reach equilibrium. The key aspect of the theory is not that all markets reach equilibrium but that they tend towards equilibrium.\n\nThe classical theory of money states that the amount of money that a household requires at a given point in time is proportional to the dollar value of its demand for commodities. Purchasing a higher value of goods will require a household to keep more cash on hand. This is known as the propensity to hold money.\n\nTo solve for the Walrasian Equilibrium there are four steps involved. Step 1 is calculating feasible outcomes, step 2 is solving for the optimum, step 3 is solving for the prices that support the optimal production plan, and step 4 is explaining why consumer demand is equal to supply at these prices.\n\nUniversidad Complutense Madrid. \"Aggregate Demand and the Classical Theory of the Price Level,\" Page 117.
