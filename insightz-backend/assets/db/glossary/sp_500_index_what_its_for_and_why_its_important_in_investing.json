  "definition": "The S&P 500 is a stock market index weighted by market capitalization that is made up of 500 of the largest public companies in the United States.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index is a list of 500 of the largest public companies in the U.S. These companies are the biggest and most important companies in the country, and represent a broad cross-section of the economy. It is managed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, a subsidiary of S&P Global. The index, which is weighted by market capitalization, is considered to be one of the best gauges of U.S. equities, the stock market, and the American economy. The index actually includes 503 components because three companies have two share classes listed.\n\nThe S&P 500 uses amarket-cap weighting methodthat gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market capitalizations.\n\nDetermining the weighting of each component of the S&P 500 begins with calculating the total market cap for the index by adding together the market cap of every company in the index.\n\nThe market cap of a company is calculated by taking the current stock price and multiplying it by the company'soutstanding shares. The total market cap for the S&P 500 as well as the market caps of individual companies are published frequently on financial websites, saving investors the need to calculate them.\n\nTheweighting of each companyin the index is calculated by taking the company's market cap and dividing it by the total market cap of the index.\n\nThe S&P 500 is a part of the S&P Global 1200 family of indices. Other indices include theS&P MidCap 400which represents the mid-cap range of companies and\u00a0theS&P SmallCap 600which represents small-cap companies. The S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600 combine\u00a0to cover 90% of all U.S. capitalization in an index known as the S&P Composite 1500.\n\nThe S&P uses onlyfree-floatingshares, the shares that the public can trade, when calculating market cap. The S&P adjusts each company's market cap to compensate for new share issues or company mergers.\n\nThe value of the index is calculated by totaling the adjusted market caps of each company and dividing the result by a divisor. The divisor is proprietary information of the S&P and isn't released to the public. The S&P Index (SPX) isn't a total return index anddoesn't include cash dividend gainsfor the companies listed.\n\nYou can nonetheless calculate a company's weighting in the index and this can provide investors with valuable information. You can get a sense as to whether it might have an impact on the overall index if a stock rises or falls. A company with a 10% weighting would have a greater impact on the value of the index than a company with a 2% weighting.\n\nThe S&P 500 is one of the most widely quoted American indexes because it represents the largest publicly\u00a0traded corporations in the U.S. It focuses on the U.S. market's large-cap sector and it's also a float-weighted index which is a type of capitalization weighting. Company market caps are adjusted by the number of shares available for public trading.\n\nThe S&P 500 was rebalanced on April 23, 2025.In the first months of 2025, several companies have entered and exited the index. Coinbase Global, DoorDash, TKO Group Holdings, Williams-Sonoma, and Expand Energy all joined the index. Conversely, Discover Financial Services, BorgWarner, Teleflex, Celanese, and FMC were removed from the S&P 500.\n\nAnother common U.S. stock market benchmark is theDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The S&P 500 is often the institutional investor's preferred index given its depth and breadth. The DJIA has historically been associated with significant equities from the retail investor's point of view. Institutional investors perceive the S&P 500 as being more representative of U.S. equity markets\u00a0because it includes more stocks across all sectors: 500 versus the Dow's 30.\n\nThe S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method that gives a higher percentage allocation to companies with the largest market caps. The DJIA is a price-weighted index that gives companies with higher stock prices a higher index weighting. The market-cap-weighted structure tends to be more common than the price-weighted index across U.S. indexes.\n\nNasdaqis a global electronic marketplace for trading securities. Several equity market indexes include stocks traded on Nasdaq. A given stock included in the S&P 500 Index may also be in one or more of the various Nasdaq indexes.\n\nSome of the most-watched Nasdaq stock indices include:\n\nThe S&P 500\u00a0is a member of a set of indexes created by Standard & Poor's. This set of indexes is like the Russell index family in that both are market-cap-weighted unless stated otherwise as in the case ofequal-weightedindexes.\n\nThere aretwo significant differencesbetween the construction of the S&P and the Russell families of indexes. Standard & Poor's chooses constituent companies via a committee.Russell indexesuse\u00a0a formula to select\u00a0which stocks to\u00a0include. There's no name overlap within S&P style indices such as growth versus value. Russell indexes will include the same company in both the value and growth style indexes.\n\nTheVanguard 500 Index Fundaims to track the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index by investing\u00a0its total net assets in the stocks that make up the index and by holding each component with approximately the same weight as the S&P index. The fund barely deviates from the S&P, which it tracks.\n\nThe S&P 500 is an index so it can't be traded directly. Anyone who wants to invest in the companies that are included in the S&P must invest in a mutual fund orexchange-traded fund (ETF)that tracks the index such as theVanguard 500 ETF(VOO).\n\nOne of the limitations of the S&P and other market-cap-weighted indexes occurs whenstocks in the indexbecome overvalued. They rise higher than their fundamentals warrant. The stock typically inflates the overall value or price of the index if it has a heavy weighting in the index while being overvalued.\n\nA company's rising market cap isn't necessarily indicative of its fundamentals. It simply reflects the stock's increase in value relative to the shares outstanding. Equal-weighted indexes have become increasingly popular as a result. Each company's stock price movements have an equal impact on these indexes.\n\nThe individual market weights must be calculated by dividing the market cap of each company by the total market cap of the index to understand how the underlying stocks affect the S&P index. Here's an example of Apple's weighting in the index:\n\nThe larger the market weight of a company, the more impact each 1% change in a stock's price will have on the index.\n\nIn 1923 the Standard Statistics Company developed its first stock index. The original index covered 233 companies and is considered a precursor to the S&P 500.The company merged with Poor's Publishing in 1941 to becomeStandard and Poor's.\n\nA company must be publicly traded and based in the United States to be included in the S&P 500 Index. It must also meet certain requirements for liquidity and market capitalization, have apublic floatof at least 10% of its shares, and have positive earnings over the trailing four quarters.\n\nThe simplest way to invest in the S&P 500 Index or any other stock market index is to buy shares of an index fund that targets it. These funds invest in a cross-section of the companies represented on the index so the fund's performance should mirror the performance of the index itself.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index is one of the mostwidely used indexesfor the U.S. stock market. These 500 companies represent the largest and most liquid companies in the U.S. from technology and software companies to banks and manufacturers. The index hashistorically been usedto provide insight into the direction of the stock market. It was created by a private company but the S&P 500 is a popular yardstick for the performance of the market economy at large.\n\nStock Analysis. \"S&P 500 Index Stocks List.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P 500: Overview.\" Download \"S&P 500 (USD) Factsheet.\" Page 1.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Index Mathematics Methodology.\" Page 6.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Global 1200: Overview.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Composite 1500: Overview.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Float Adjustment Methodology.\" Page 6.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"S&P Dow Jones Indices Announces April 2025 Rebalance of the S&P 500 Scored & Screened Index.\"\n\nYahoo!
