He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nAn ascending channel is theprice actioncontained between upward sloping parallel lines. Higher highs and higher lows characterize this price pattern. Technical analysts construct an ascending channel by drawing a lowertrend linethat connects the swing lows, and an upper channel line that joins the swing highs.\n\nThe pattern\u2019s opposite counterpart is thedescending channel.\n\nWithin an ascending channel, price does not always remain entirely contained within the pattern\u2019s parallel lines but instead shows areas ofsupport and resistancethat traders can use to set stop-loss orders and profit targets. Abreakoutabove an ascending channel can signal a continuation of the move higher, while a breakdown below an ascending channel can indicate a possible trend change.\n\nAscending\u00a0channels show a clearly defineduptrend. Traders canswing tradebetween the pattern\u2019s support and resistance levels or trade in the direction of a breakout or breakdown.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021\n\nEnvelope channelsare another popularchannelformation that can incorporate both descending and ascending channel patterns.\n\nEnvelope channels are typically used to chart and analyze a security\u2019s price movement over a longer period of time, whereas ascending and descending channels can be beneficial for charting a security\u2019s price immediately after areversal. Trend lines can be based onmoving averagesor highs and lows over specified intervals.\n\nTwo of the most common envelope channels includeBollinger BandsandDonchian Channels.\n\nThomas Bulkowski. \u201cEncyclopedia of Chart Patterns,\u201d Pages 114-131.
