  "term": "What Is a Target-Date Fund (TDF)? Risk Tolerance and Example",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA target-date fund or TDF, to investors, is a long-term investment account that is automatically adjusted over the years as the investor approaches a specific milestone such as retirement.\n\nTDFs are designed to invest heavily in riskier growth stocks in the early years. This is intended to rack up gains while the investor has plenty of time to recover from any short-term losses. In later years, the investment choices lean towards more conservative choices to consolidate gains and avoid untimely losses.\n\nTarget-date mutual fundsare offered by many company 401(k) plans. TDFs also are an option for people investing in individual retirement accounts (IRAs).\n\nTarget date funds use a traditional portfolio management method to revise asset allocation over the term of the fund to meet the investor's objective.\n\nA fund's portfolio managers use this predetermined time horizon to fashion their investment strategy according to a standard long-term asset allocation strategy. This strategy relies on riskier stocks in the early years, moving gradually toward fixed-income investments like bonds in later years.\n\nThe fund managers use the target date to determine the degree of risk currently appropriate for the investor. Target-date portfolio managers typically readjust portfolio risk levels annually.\n\nThese increasingly popular funds generally include the target date in the fund name. For example, the Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund (VSVNX) is designed to reach the investor's objective in 2070.\n\nFollowing its initial launch, a target-date fund has a high tolerance for risk and therefore is more heavily weighted toward high-performing but speculative assets. At the annual adjustment, portfolio managers will reset the\u00a0allocation of investment categories.\n\nA target-date fund\u2019s portfolio mix of assets and degree of risk becomes more conservative as it approaches its objective target date. Higher-risk portfolio investments typically include domestic and global equities. Lower-risk portions of a target-date portfolio typically include fixed-income investments such as bonds and\u00a0cash equivalents.\n\nMost fund marketing materials show the allocationglide path\u2014that is, the shift in asset allocation\u2014across the entire investment time horizon. The funds structure their glide rate to achieve the most conservative allocation right at the specified target date.\n\nSome target-date funds, known as\u201cthrough\u201d funds, will also manage funds to a specified asset allocation past the target date. In the years beyond the target date, allocations are more heavily weighted toward low-risk, fixed-income investments.\n\nOther target-date funds, known as \"to funds,\" cease any modifications to asset allocation once the target date is reached.\n\nMost TDFs are mutual funds, but there aretarget-date ETFsand target-date mutual funds that charge low fees.\n\nTarget-date funds are popular with401(k) planinvestors, particularly those who don't have the time or the inclination to review their fund's holdings annually and revise their investment strategy appropriately.\n\nTDFs allow investors to put the work on autopilot. A younger worker hoping to retire in 2065 would choose a target-date 2065 fund, while an older worker hoping to retire in 2030 would choose a target-date 2030 fund.\n\nFor some, TDFs eliminate the need to add another retirement savings vehicle as a backup to a 401(k). Some financial professionals advise that if you invest in only one long-term savings plan, it should be a TDF.\n\nThe autopilot nature of target-date fundscan cut both ways. The predetermined shifting of the portfolio assets may not suit an individual's changing goals and needs.\n\nWhat if you have to retire substantially earlier than the target date, or decide you want to keep working longer?\n\nIn fact, there are no guarantees that the fund will generate a certain amount of income or gains. A target-date fund is an investment, not an annuity. As with all investments, these funds are subject to risk and underperformance.\n\nLong-term investing on autopilot\n\nGeared towards sensible retirement planning\n\nHigher expenses than other passive investments\n\nLittle room for changing investor goals and needs\n\nTarget-date funds can be expensive. A TDF is afund of funds(FoF), meaning it is a mutual fund that invests in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds. That means you have to pay the expense ratios of those underlying assets as well as the fees of the target-date fund.\n\nAn increasing number of TDFs are no-load funds and, overall, fees have been decreasing. Still, it is something to watch out for, especially if your fund invests in a lot of passively managed vehicles. Why pay double fees on index funds when you could buy and hold them on your own?\n\nAlso, it's worth bearing in mind that similarly named target-date funds are not the same\u2014or, more specifically, their assets are not the same.\n\nYes, all 2045 target-date funds will be heavily weighted toward equities, but some might opt for domestic stocks while others look to international stocks. Some might go for investment-grade bonds and others choose high-yield, lower-grade debt instruments.\n\nMake sure the fund's portfolio of assets fits your comfort level and own appetite for risk.\n\nVanguard is one of the investment companiesoffering a comprehensive seriesof target-date funds. Below we compare the characteristics of the Vanguard 2065 (VLXVX) fund to the characteristics of the Vanguard 2025 fund (VTTVX).\n\nThe Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX) has an expense ratio of 0.08%. As of May 31, 2024, the portfolio allocation was 89.49% in stocks, 9.61% in bonds, and 0.90% in short-term reserves. It holds otherVanguard mutual fundsto achieve its goals.\n\nIt had 54% invested in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, 36.30% invested in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 6.70% invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, and 3% invested in the Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund.\n\nExpense ratios eat away at returns. Passively managed funds have lower expense ratios than actively managed ones. When choosing funds, try to align your return goals with your risk tolerance and expenses.\n\nThe Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 Fund (VTTVX) has an expense ratio of 0.08%. Because it matures much sooner than the 2065 fund, it is more conservative. As of May 31, 2024, its portfolio is weighted 52.02% in stocks, 47.08% in bonds, and 0.90% in short-term reserves.\n\nIt has allocated 31.50% of assets to the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, 28.80% to the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, 21.10% to the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 12.40% to the Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund, and 6.20% to the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund.\n\nBoth funds invest in almost all the same assets; however, the 2065 Fund is more heavily weighted toward stocks, with a relatively smaller percentage of bonds and cash equivalents. The 2025 Fund has greater weight in fixed income and fewer\u00a0stocks,\u00a0so it is less volatile and more likely to contain the assets the investor needs to begin making\u00a0withdrawals\u00a0in 2025.\n\nYes, you can keep a target-date fund after its target date. The fund will be one of two types:\n\nIn general, a target-date fund may have a higher expense ratio than a standard mutual fund. This is because the target-date fund is a fund of funds that invests in other mutual funds, adding a double layer of fees paid by the investor.\n\nMoreover, since the fund rebalances regularly, it ismore active than a standard index fund.\n\nThat said, manytarget-date index fundsavailable today have low expense ratios of 0.10% or lower.\n\nYes. Most plan providers today offer a target-date fund among their choices.\n\nConsider using only a target-date fund rather than spreading your money among several choices. Allocating money to other investments may defeat the purpose of a target-date fund.\n\nMost target-date funds are established in 5-year intervals (for example, maturing in 2030, 2035, or 2040). There is no set rule if you plan to retire in, say, 2033. You can round up to the 2035 fund, or if you prefer a slightly lower risk level, use the nearer-term 2030 one.\n\nYou can also choose to divide your allocation between the funds with the earlier and the later target dates.\n\nTarget-date funds are set up to coincide with an investor's retirement timing. The funds start off with more aggressive investment choices in their early years. As the target date approaches, the choices get more conservative to preserve gains.\n\nTarget-date funds can be a great investment option for those not interested in constantly reconsidering and adjusting their investment choices.\n\nTarget-date funds can be relatively expensive in terms of fees. They also differ greatly from company to company. Check the prospectus before you make a decision.\n\nVanguard. \"Vanguard Target Retirement 2070 Fund.\"\n\nVanguard. \"Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX).\"\n\nVanguard. \"Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 Fund (VTTVX).\"",
