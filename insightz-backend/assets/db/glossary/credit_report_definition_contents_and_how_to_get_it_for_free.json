  "definition": "A credit report is a detailed breakdown of yourcredit historyprepared by acredit bureau. Credit bureaus collect financial information about you and compile their reports based on that information. Lenders use the reports, often along with other data, to determine yourcreditworthiness. Insurance companies, employers, and landlords may check your credit reports, as well.\n\nIn the United States there are three major credit reporting bureaus:Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Each of these companies collects information about your credit history to create a unique credit report on you. Although most of their information is similar, there are often small differences among the three reports depending on which of your creditors, such as mortgage lenders and credit card companies, provide information to that particular bureau. Some creditors may supply information to one or two bureaus but not all three, and some may not supply any information on you at all.\n\nCredit reports focus primarily on your use of credit. They do not include information on other types of bills. Nor do they show your income, investments, or other assets.\n\nDerek Notman, CFP\u00ae, ChFC, CLUIntrepid Wealth Partners LLC, Madison, WI\n\nMake sure to review your credit report before you need it. A client of mine was applying for a home mortgage, and when the bank pulled their credit report, there was over $20,000 of credit card debt on the report, but the client didn't have any credit cards.\n\nWhat had happened was that the client had the same name as their father, so when the credit report was run, it pulled their correct information but also accidentally pulled their father\u2019s credit card balance.\n\nMake sure to check for errors before you think you will need to apply for credit, so you can have them fixed if there are any. Not doing this could delay your credit decision, cause your lender to think twice about lending you credit, and ultimately delay a time-sensitive purchase.\n\nCredit reports typically divide information into four sections. These are:\n\nCredit scoresare three-digit numbers, typically ranging from 300 to 850, that serve as a sort of shorthand for your creditworthiness. The information in your credit reports is used to compute your credit scores, but the scores themselves are not part of your report and must be obtained separately.\n\nCredit scores are computed using formulas developed byFICOor a competitor such asVantageScore. They assign different weightings to the information in your credit report, to reflect its importance and predictive value. A typical FICO score breaks down like this:\n\nPayment history: 35%.This reflects whether you pay your credit bills on time.\n\nAmounts owed: 30%.This looks at factors such as yourcredit utilization ratio, which compares how much debt you have outstanding to the total amount of credit you have available to you. Generally speaking, the lower that percentage, the better.\n\nLength of credit history: 15%.Older accounts count for more than newer ones.\n\nCredit mix: 10%.The credit scoring models favor individuals who've had a variety of credit types (such as a credit card and a car loan or mortgage) and used them all responsibly.\n\nNew credit: 10%.If you've taken on a lot of new credit lately, lenders can see that as a red flag.\n\nWhile that's a typical breakdown, some scoring models put greater emphasis on certain factors. For example, there are scoring models specifically for mortgage lenders, car loan lenders, and credit card issuers. As a result, many consumers won't have just one credit score but several of them.\n\nInformation on your credit report will typically remain for at least seven years, after which it basically falls off. One exception is Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can remain for up to 10 years.\n\nUnder theFair Credit Reporting Act, businesses and other parties need a legally permissible reason to request your credit report. That list can include lenders, insurance companies, employers, landlords, and government agencies. In the case of employers, you must give your permission in writing.\n\nBy law, you are entitled to a free copy of your credit report from each of the three major bureaus at least once a year. The official website for that purpose isAnnualCreditReport.com. You're also entitled to see your credit report free of charge if you've recently been denied credit, insurance, or employment based on the information in your report or if you've been a victim of identity theft.\n\nYour credit reports containinformation that lenders, insurance companies, and others will use to judge you. For that reason it's important to check your reports periodically to make sure the information in them is correct. If you find errors, you have a right to dispute them, and the credit bureau is required by law to investigate the matter and get back to you.\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"A Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,\" Page 1.\n\nExperian. \"Understanding Your Experian Credit Report.\"\n\nmyFICO. \"What's in My FICO Scores?\"\n\nTransUnion. \"How Long Does Bankruptcy Stay on Your Credit Report?\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Who May Request My Credit Report?\"",
