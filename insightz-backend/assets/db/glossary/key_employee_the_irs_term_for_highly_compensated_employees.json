She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA key employee is an employee with a major ownership and/or decision-making role in the business. Key employees are usually highly compensated either monetarily with benefits, or both. Key employees may also receive special benefits as an incentive both to join the company and to stay with the company.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service also uses theterm \"key employee.\" The IRS uses this term concerning company-sponsored defined contribution retirement plans. It refers:\n\nFrom an internal perspective, apart from the IRS classification, a key employee may be considered to be an intrinsic part of a company\u2019s operations. Such an employee could be influential in securingcapitalfor the business, which may occur through their connections or by virtue of their work.\n\nFor example, the employee may hold a role tied directly to sales channels for the company, intertwining their performance and business activities with the cash flow. The employee might be the top-performing salesperson at the company, driving a significant portion of the regular revenue.\n\nFor various reasons, the employee may represent a public face associated with the company\u2019s brand and\u00a0is thus seen as crucial to maintaining the investment and support ofshareholdersand customers.\n\nOther IRS and government rules have different definitions of \"key employee\" for different purposes.\n\nThe company may define the work of the employee as vital to the infrastructure and operation of the business, even though that employee may not have a highly visible role in terms of public or outside business relations.\n\nFor instance, the chief scientist on a team developing a novel new product expected to be a mainstay behind the business\u2019s revenue and income could be regarded as a key employee.\n\nEmployers may feel the need to address compensation for key employees differently from the majority of the staff beyond providing salary. This can include offering a variety of options for them to save for retirement or presenting them with work-life balance benefits to keep them engaged in the business.\n\nConversely, employers might adopt a different stance if a key employee makes use of theFamily and Medical Leave Actto take unpaid leave from work. Such employees, who may rank among the top 10% of salaried workers at a company, might not be reinstated by the employer under certain circumstances.\n\nKey employee examples are the chief executive officer (CEO), chief operating officer (COO), sales managers, innovators, such as the heads of research and development, and specialists, such as data scientists, quants, or lawyers.\n\nA key man clause is a clause often seen in investment funds, such ashedge funds. It stipulates that the fund cannot make investment decisions or other important decisions without the \"key man,\" which is often the founder of the firm or the head investment manager. This individual is key to the fund's success. Key man clauses are triggered if the key person quits, retires, dies, or is otherwise no longer involved in the fund's decisions. This is to protect investors and other interested parties, such as lenders.\n\nThere is no requirement for a minimum number of employees for a company to have in order to have a CEO. A company can have a CEO even with one employee. That person could be the founder and operator of the business and would act as the CEO. A company could have two people and have a CEO. A CEO would be the person of any business that guides the company to achieve its vision.\n\nKey employees in a company hold decision-making power or significant ownership and have an outsized impact on the company's success. These individuals are highly compensated, usually through high salaries, excellent benefits, and other positives, such as stock options in order to retain them. Many investors and other interested parties, such as lenders, seek to ensure a key employee remains at the company and can institute clauses if the key employee leaves.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Issue Snapshot - Identifying Highly Compensated Employees in an Initial or Short Plan Year.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"2024 Limitations Adjusted as Provided in Section 415(d), etc.\" Page 2.",
