  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe term qualification ratio refers to the measure of a borrower'screditworthinessthat helps lenders decide whether to extend credit. A qualification ratio is used in the underwriting process to calculate how likely it would be for a borrower to repay a loan.\n\nLenders normally use one of two qualification ratios in their underwriting process. The first is the monthlydebt-to-income ratio (DTI), while the second is theback-end ratio, which calculates the monthly debt payment to income. Qualification ratios also determine the terms of any credit application, including repayment terms and interest rates.\n\nConsumer credit applications provide mortgage lenders with a window into applicants' personal and financial situations. Consumers are required to provide information such as their name, address, and financial information on these applications. This information includes employment information,income, anddebts. Lenders use this information in theunderwritingprocess to determine whether or not to approve a consumer's credit application for most credit products, especially loans and mortgages.\n\nA borrower's housing expenses, includinghomeowners insurance, taxes, utilities, and neighborhood or association fees, cannot exceed 28% of a borrower's\u00a0monthlygross income.Another qualification ratio, the borrower\u2019s DTI, includes housing expenses plus debt and generally cannot\u00a0exceed 36% of monthly gross income.\n\nHigher ratios indicate an increased risk ofdefault. However, some lenders may accept higher ratios in exchange for certain factors, such as substantialdown payments, sizable savings, and favorablecredit scores. For example, a lender may offer a mortgage to a borrower with a high front-end ratio if they pay half of the purchase price as a down payment.\n\nLenders generally prefer a front-end ratio of no more than 31% or less forFederal Housing Administration (FHA)loans.\n\nAs mentioned above, lenders generally use one of two qualification ratios to determine the likelihood ofrepayment. This is based on the information provided by the applicant and theircredit report.\n\nThe first ratio involves the applicant's total monthly debt to total monthly income, while the other calculates the total monthly debt payments versus the total monthly income. These ratios take\u00a0the total annualincome of a householdand divide it by 12. Banks generally use the lower of the two numbers to determine how large a loan to offer you.\n\nQualification ratios are not rigid. Excellentcredit historyoften mitigates a poor ratio, for example. In addition, some borrowers who do not meet the standard qualifying ratios take advantage of special mortgage programs offered by some banks. The added risk of default by these borrowers means they generally pay higherinterest ratesthan mortgages that meet\u00a0standard qualifying ratios.\n\nCredit carddebt also counts toward your back-end ratio, but this is much more complicated. Lenders used to apply theminimum paymenton a credit card balance and call that monthly debt. However, that system wasn't fair to credit card users who paid\u00a0off their balance in full every month and used credit cards mainly for convenience and reward points.\n\nMost lenders now look at the borrower\u2019s totalrevolving balanceand apply 5% of the total as monthly debt. Say\u00a0you carry $10,000 in credit card debt. In this case, the bank tacks on $500 in monthly debt to your back-end ratio.\n\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how qualification ratios work. Let's say you and your spouse earn a combined $96,000 a year; your family's\u00a0gross income would amount to $8,000 a month. Multiply $8,000 by the 28% threshold required by most lenders, and you\u2019ll get the minimum housing expense you can afford, which lenders call the front orfront-end ratio.\n\nIn this case, your family would be eligible for a loan if total monthly housing expenses do not exceed $2,240. Note this expense figure\u00a0includes property taxes, homeowner\u2019s insurance,private mortgage insurance (PMI), and charges such as\u00a0condo fees.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the back-end ratio using the same example. In this case, multiply the $8,000 monthly income by the minimum threshold of 36%. This is effectively your debt-to-income ratio, and you'll get a figure of $2,880. Next, deduct any monthly debt payments from that $2,880. Let's assume these consist of a $300 monthly car payment and a $400 monthly student loan payment. This\u00a0leaves you with $2,180 for housing expenses. Note that this figure is typically\u00a0lower than the front-end ratio.\n\nIt can take time to improve your ratio since you'll typically need to pay down a significant portion of your debt or increase your income to offset your debts.\n\nThe FHA requires a front-end ratio of no more than 31%, while the back-end ratio can't exceed 43%. That said, if your credit score is 580+ and you have cash reserves, no discretionary debt, residual income, or other income, you might qualify with higher ratios.\n\nIt depends on the lender and the type of mortgage you're trying to get. Lenders closely examine your debt, income, and credit score to make their decisions. If you know you've got a high DTI, you're more likely to qualify if you can put down a substantial down payment.\n\nA qualification ratio might seem like an arbitrary factor in determining someone's mortgage eligibility. However, it's a useful tool for seeing how much of a mortgage someone can realistically afford. Improving your qualification ratio shows lenders that you have healthy financial habits and an income that could support paying a mortgage.\n\nFreddie Mac. \"Monthly Housing Expense-to-Income Ratio.\"\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"Debt-to-Income Calculator,\" Page 2.\n\nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. \"Section F.
