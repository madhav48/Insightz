  "definition": "Learn How To Identify When Assets Are Over or Underpriced\n\nThe stochastic RSI is an indicator used in technical analysis that ranges between zero and one (or zero and 100 on some charting platforms) and is created by applying the stochastic oscillator formula to a set of relative strength index values rather than to standard price data.\n\nThe stochastic relative strength index (stochRSI) is a technical indicator that greatly influences how technically-minded investors read market momentum. While it may sound like arcane financial jargon, this powerful tool has been credited with predicting major market moves, sometimes days before they occur.\n\nStochRSI is a sophisticated step up from the widely-used relative strength index (RSI). By applying a stochastic oscillator formula to RSI values, the stochRSI aims to provide a more nuanced view of overbought and oversold conditions (that is, when prices are too high or too low) for financial assets. In an era where algorithmic trading dominates and market volatility can spike instantly, tools like the stochRSI are part of a vast arsenal institutional and retail investors use to navigate turbulent market waters. Today, these instruments make doing so more like having advanced GPS over the star charts of earlier centuries' navigation.\n\nBelow, we examine how traders use this indicator to inform their strategies, its potential advantages over traditional RSI, and the pitfalls to watch out for when relying on this or any single technical indicator.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021\n\nStochRSI=RSI\u2212min\u2061[RSI]max\u2061[RSI]\u2212min\u2061[RSI]where:RSI=Current\u00a0RSI\u00a0readingmin\u2061[RSI]=Lowest\u00a0RSI\u00a0reading\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a014\u00a0periods(or\u00a0your\u00a0chosen\u00a0lookback\u00a0interval)max\u2061[RSI]=Highest\u00a0RSI\u00a0reading\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a014\u00a0periods(or\u00a0your\u00a0chosen\u00a0lookback\u00a0interval)\\begin{aligned} &\\text{StochRSI}=\\frac{RSI-\\min\\left[{RSI} \\right ]}{\\max\\left[{RSI} \\right ] - \\min\\left[{RSI} \\right ]}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &RSI = \\text{Current RSI reading}\\\\ &\\min\\left[{RSI} \\right ] = \\text{Lowest RSI reading over the last 14 periods}\\\\ &\\;\\text{(or your chosen lookback interval)}\\\\ &\\max\\left[{RSI} \\right ] = \\text{Highest RSI reading over the last 14 periods}\\\\ &\\;\\text{(or your chosen lookback interval)} \\end{aligned}\u200bStochRSI=max[RSI]\u2212min[RSI]RSI\u2212min[RSI]\u200bwhere:RSI=Current\u00a0RSI\u00a0readingmin[RSI]=Lowest\u00a0RSI\u00a0reading\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a014\u00a0periods(or\u00a0your\u00a0chosen\u00a0lookback\u00a0interval)max[RSI]=Highest\u00a0RSI\u00a0reading\u00a0over\u00a0the\u00a0last\u00a014\u00a0periods(or\u00a0your\u00a0chosen\u00a0lookback\u00a0interval)\u200b\n\nAn oscillator in financial markets is a technical analysis tool that varies within a certain range over time, typically used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in an asset. Oscillators are usually displayed as graphs and can signal potential price reversals, helping traders make buy or sell decisions. Common examples include the RSI and the stochastic oscillator.\n\nThestochRSI is based\u00a0on RSI readings. The RSI has an input value, typically 14, which tells the indicator how many periods of data it is using in its calculation. These RSI levels are then used in the stochRSI formula.\n\nThe stoch RSI was developed by Tushar S. Chande and Stanley Kroll and detailed in their book \"The New Technical Trader,\" first published in 1994. Whiletechnical indicatorsalready existed to show overbought and other conditions when prices were poised to rise or fall levels, the two developed stochRSI to improve sensitivity and generate a greater number of signals than traditional indicators could do.\n\nStochRSI deems something to be oversold when the value drops below 0.30, meaning the RSI value is trading at the lower end of its predefined range, and that the short-term direction of the underlying security may be nearing a low a possible move higher. Conversely, a reading above 0.70 suggests the RSI may be reaching extreme highs and could be used to signal a pullback in theunderlying security.\n\nAlong with identifying overbought or oversold conditions, stochRSI can be used to identify short-term trends by looking at it in the context of an oscillator with a centerline at 0.50. When the stochRSI is above 0.50, the security may be seen as trending higher, and vice versa when it's below 0.50.\n\nStochRSI should also be used with other technical indicators or chart patterns to improve its effectiveness, which is especially important given the high number of signals that it generates.\n\nIn addition, non-momentum oscillators like theaccumulation distribution linemay be particularly helpful because they don't overlap in functionality and provide insights from a different perspective.\n\nThough similar, stochRSI relies on a different formula than RSI. RSI is aderivativeof price, while stochRSI is derived from RSI itself. One key difference is how quickly the indicators move. StochRSI moves very quickly from overbought to oversold or vice versa, while RSI is a much slower-moving indicator. One isn't better than the other: stochRSI just moves more (and more quickly) than the RSI.\n\nIndicator Type: StochRSI is an oscillator of an oscillator, applying the stochastic formula to the RSI values to improve sensitivity\n\nSensitivity and Speed: StochRSI is more sensitive and faster than RSI\n\nFrequency of Signals: StochRSI generates signals more frequently than RSI\n\nIndicator Type: RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price move\n\nSensitivity and Speed: RSI is less sensitive and slower than stochRSI\n\nFrequency of Signals: RSI generates signals less frequently than stochRSI\n\nOne downside to using the stochRSI is that it tends to be quite volatile, rapidly moving from high to low. Smoothing the stochRSI may help in this regard. Some traders will take amoving averageof the stochRSI to reduce thevolatilityand potentially make the indicator more useful. For example, a 10-day simple moving average of the stochRSI can produce an indicator that's much smoother and more stable. Most charting platforms allow for applying one type of indicator to another without any personal calculations required.\n\nAlso, the stochRSI is the second\u00a0derivative of price. In other words, its output is two steps away from the actual price of the asset being analyzed, which means it could be out of sync with an asset's market price in real time.\n\nNow that we better understand the differences between this and other indicators, as well as potential drawbacks, let's look at the differences in calculating stochRSI vs. RSI vs. the stochastic oscillator:\n\nSome technical indicators that are like the stochRSI include theWilliams %R, themoney flow index, and the stochastic oscillator.\n\nTraders and investors should consider combining the stochastic RSI with other indicators, watching for extreme values of the stochRSI and any divergences from other indicators.\n\nStochRSI can be paired with moving averages, themoving average convergence/divergence andBollinger Bands. These can give more robust trading signals and reduce the likelihood of false positives.\n\nStochRSI is a transformed version of the traditional RSI that enhances sensitivity and provides more frequent trading signals. By applying the stochastic oscillator formula to the values derived from the RSI, stochRSI offers a good tool for identifying overbought and oversold conditions in the market.\n\nIts utility in various trading strategies, particularly when combined with other technical indicators, makes it a valuable asset for traders and investors looking to refine their security and market analysis.\n\nMark Andrew Lim. \"The Handbook of Technical Analysis,\" Pages 793-811.
