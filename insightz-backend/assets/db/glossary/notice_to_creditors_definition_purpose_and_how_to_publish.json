Known creditors must be given specific notice. The published notice captures all other unknown creditors.\n\nThe executor or executrix\u2014in some states known as the personal representative\u2014is charged with paying outstanding debts and collecting monies owed to the estate as part of her duties after being appointed by the court.\n\nIn the United States, when a person dies, there may be an informal probate process of the deceased's estate. The phrase \u201cavoiding probate\u201d refers to the strategy of arranging for the non-probate transfer of assets via trusts, joint accounts, or by other means, such as life insurance.\n\nSome states have an asset threshold allowing small estates to avoid probate, but if an interested party objects, assets exist that require probate, or other issues are evident, a probate case will be opened.\n\nDepending on state laws, once probate is opened,creditorshave a limited amount of time from the date they were notified of the testator\u2019s death to present any claims against the estate for money owed to them. Claims that are rejected by the executor can be filed in the court where a probate judge will have the final say on whether or not the claim must be paid.\n\nEven though newspapers have given way to digital and online media, they are still a commonly used medium with which to provide notice to outstanding creditors.\n\nA notice to creditors is also filed for bankruptcy proceedings. In the event of personal bankruptcy, the notice is filed before the first meeting of creditors, known as a341 meeting.
