  "term": "Utility Revenue Bond: What It Is, How It Works",
  "definition": "A utility revenue bond, also known as an essential service bond, is a type ofmunicipal bondissued to finance a public utility that repaysbondholdersdirectly from project revenues rather than a general tax fund.\n\nA utility revenue bond is used to fund capital\u00a0projects in areas considered essential to public services including hospitals, fire service, water and\u00a0waste treatment facilities, and improvements to the electrical grid. These services\u00a0generate revenue through customer fees, which provide cash flows that can service the debt.\n\nRevenue bonds\u00a0come with either agross revenueor anet revenuepledge.\u00a0A gross revenue pledge gives bondholder payments priority\u00a0over\u00a0operational or maintenance costs incurred by the project.\u00a0A net revenue pledge allows for the disbursement of administrative expenses and upkeep costs before\u00a0satisfying obligations to bondholders.\n\nUtilities\u00a0deliver essential services such as water and electricity. Due to the necessity of these services, it\u00a0is common for utility revenue bonds to feature a net revenue pledge, as upkeep must be implemented to maintain them in good working order.\n\nIt is also common for utilities to be required to maintain a specific revenue-to-expenditure ratio. The inclusion of debt repayment is as an expense, and the ratio is often used to support customer rate increases for public utilities.\n\nMunicipal bonds repay\u00a0bondholders through either municipal taxation, as in ageneral obligation bond,\u00a0or throughrevenue bonds. Revenue bonds derive income from the capital project. The issuer of general obligation bonds guarantees the repayment of debt via any means necessary. To collect funds, the issuer can raise taxes, issue another round of bonds, or even sell physical assets. The issuer is not constrained to a single revenue stream to satisfy obligations. Investors should be aware of this distinction and can use it as they build a diversified, fixed-income portfolio.\n\nOther factors come into play whencredit ratings agenciesor investors evaluate utility revenue bonds and the projects they finance. Thecoverage ratiois used to determine expected revenues to principal and interest obligations. Population size and trends can provide an idea of future revenue growth or decline for a utility project.\n\nCustomer concentration describes the mix of consumers whose usage fees support debt repayment. If a small number of consumers use a significant portion of a public utility's service, that may lead to risk for the viability of that project's revenues.",
