  "definition": "The EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is a financial ratio that is used to assess a company's financial durability by examining whether it is at least profitable enough to pay off its interest expenses using its pre-tax income. Specifically it looks to see what proportion ofearnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization(EBITDA), can be used for this purpose.\n\nThe EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is also known simply as as EBITDA coverage. The main difference between EBITDA coverage and theinterest coverage ratio, is that the latter usesearnings before interest and taxes(EBIT), rather than the more encompassing EBITDA.\n\nThe EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio was first widely used byleveraged buyoutbankers, who would use it as a first screen to determine whether a newly restructured company would be able to service itsshort-term debtobligations. A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the company has more than enough interest coverage to pay off its interest expenses.\n\nWhile the ratio is a very easy way to assess whether a company cancover its interest-related expenses, the applications of this ratio are also limited by the relevance of using EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization) as a proxy for various financial figures. For example, suppose that a company has an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of 1.25; this may not mean that it would be able to cover its interest payments since the company might need to spend a large portion of its profits on replacing old equipment. Because EBITDA does not account for depreciation-related expenses, a ratio of 1.25 might not be a definitive indicator of financial durability.\n\nThere are two formulas used for the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio that differ slightly. Analysts may differ in opinion on which one is more applicable to use depending on the company being analyzed. They are as follows:\n\nAs an example, consider the following. A company reports sales revenue of $1,000,000. Salary expenses are reported as $250,000, while utilities are reported as $20,000. Lease payments are $100,000. The company also reportsdepreciationof $50,000 andinterest expensesof $120,000. To calculate the EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio, first an analyst needs to calculate the EBITDA. EBITDA is calculated by taking the company'sEBIT(earnings before interest and tax) and adding back the depreciation and amortization amounts.\n\nIn the above example, the company's EBIT and EBITDA are calculated as:\n\nNext, using the formula for EBITDA-to-interest coverage that includes the lease payments term, the company's EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio is:",
