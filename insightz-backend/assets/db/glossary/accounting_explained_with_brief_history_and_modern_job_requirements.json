Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nAccounting is the process of tracking the income and expenses of a business or other organization.\n\nAccounting is the process of recording financial transactions pertaining to a business or other large organization. The accounting process includes summarizing, analyzing, and reporting these transactions to oversight agencies, regulators, and tax collection entities. The financial statements used in accounting are a concise summary of financial transactions over an accounting period, summarizing a company's operations, financial position, and cash flows.\n\nAccounting is one of the key functions of almost any business. A bookkeeper or an accountant may handle it\u00a0at a small firm. At larger companies, there might be sizable finance departments guided by a unifiedaccounting manualwith dozens of employees.\n\nThe reports generated by various streams of accounting, such as cost accounting and managerial accounting, are invaluable in helping management make informed business decisions.\n\nThe financial statements that summarize a large company's operations, financial position, and cash flows over a particular period are concise andconsolidated reportsbased on thousands of individual financial transactions.\n\nAs a result, all professional accounting designations are the culmination of years of study and rigorous examinations combined with a minimum number of years of practical accounting experience.\n\nThe history of accounting has been around almost as long as money itself. Accounting history dates back to ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Babylon. For example, during the Roman Empire, the government had detailed records of its finances. However, modern accounting as a profession has only been around since the early 19th century.\n\nLuca Pacioli is considered \"The Father of Accounting and Bookkeeping\" due to his contributions to the development of accounting as a profession. An Italian mathematician and friend of Leonardo da Vinci, Pacioli published a book on the double-entry system of bookkeeping in 1494.\n\nBy 1880, the modern profession of accounting was fully formed and recognized by theInstitute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.\n\nThis institute created many of the systems by which accountants practice today. The formation of the institute occurred in large part due to the Industrial Revolution. Merchants not only needed to track their records but sought to avoid bankruptcy as well.\n\nThe Alliance for Responsible Professional Licensing (ARPL) was formed in August 2019 in response to a series of state deregulatory proposals making the requirements to become a CPA more lenient. The ARPL is a coalition of various advanced professional groups including engineers, accountants, and architects.\n\nAccountants may be tasked with recording specific transactions or working with specific sets of information. For this reason, there are several broad groups that most accountants can be grouped into.\n\nFinancial accountingrefers to the processes used to generate interim and annual financial statements. The results of all financial transactions that occur during an accounting period are summarized in the balance sheet,\u00a0income statement,\u00a0and\u00a0cash flow statement. The financial statements of most companies are audited annually by an external CPA firm.\n\nAudits are a legal requirement for companies that trade on the stock exchange. However, lenders also typically require the results of an external audit every year as part of their debt covenants. Therefore, most companies will have annual audits for one reason or another.\n\nManagerial accountinguses much of the same data as financial accounting, but it organizes and utilizes information in different ways. In managerial accounting, an accountant generates monthly or quarterly reports that a business's management team can use to make decisions about how the business operates.\n\nManagerial accounting alsoencompasses many other facets of accounting, including budgeting, forecasting, and various financial analysis tools. Any information that may be useful to management falls under this umbrella.\n\nJust as managerial accounting helps businesses make management decisions, cost accounting helps businesses make decisions about costing. Essentially, cost accounting considers all of the costs related to producing a product.\n\nAnalysts, managers, business owners, and accountants use this information to determine what their products should cost. In cost accounting, money is cast as an economic factor in production, whereas in financial accounting, money is considered to be a measure of a company's economic performance.\n\nWhile financial accountants often use one set of rules to report the financial position of a company, tax accountants often use a different set of rules. These rules are set at the federal, state, or local level based on what return is being filed.\n\nTax accounts balance compliance with reporting rules while also attempting to minimize a company's tax liability through thoughtful strategic decision-making.\n\nA tax accountant often oversees the entire tax process of a company: the strategic creation of the organization chart, the operations, the compliance, the reporting, and the remittance of tax liability.\n\nWhile basic accounting functions can be handled by a bookkeeper, advanced accounting is typically handled by qualified accountants who possess designations such asCertified Public Accountant(CPA) orCertified Management Accountant(CMA) in the United States.\n\nIn Canada, the three legacy designations\u2014theChartered Accountant(CA), Certified General Accountant (CGA), and Certified Management Accountant (CMA)\u2014have been unified under the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation.\n\nA major component of the accounting profession is the \"Big Four\". These four largest accounting firms (Ernst & Young, KPMG, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte) conduct audit, consulting, tax advisory, and other services. These firms, along with many other smaller firms, comprise the public accounting realm that generally advises financial and tax accounting.\n\nCareers in accounting may vastly differ by industry, department, and niche. Some relevant job titles may include:\n\nAs of June 2024, the average Certified Public Accountant in the United States made $199,000 per year.\n\nIn most cases, accountants usegenerally accepted accounting principles(GAAP) when preparing financial statements in the U.S. GAAP is a set of standards and principles designed to improve the comparability and consistency of financial reporting across industries.\n\nIts standards are based on double-entry accounting, a method in which every accounting transaction is entered as both a debit and credit in two separate general ledger accounts that will roll up into the balance sheet and income statement.\n\nIn most other countries, a set of standards governed by the International Accounting Standards Board named theInternational Financial Reporting Standards(IFRS) is used.\n\nTax accountants overseeing returns in the United States rely on guidance from the Internal Revenue Service. Federal tax returns must comply with tax guidance outlined by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\n\nTax accounts may also lean in on state or county taxes as outlined by the jurisdiction in which the business conducts business. Foreign companies must comply with tax guidance in the countries in which they must file a return.\n\nAccountants often leverage software to aid in their work. Some accounting software is considered better for small businesses such as QuickBooks, Quicken, FreshBooks, Xero, or Sage 50.\n\nLarger companies often have much more complex solutions to integrate with their specific reporting needs. This includes add-on modules or in-home software solutions. Large accounting solutions include Oracle, NetSuite, or Sage products.\n\nFinancial accountants typically operate in a cyclical environment with the same steps happening in order and repeating every reporting period. These steps are often referred to as the accounting cycle, the process of taking raw transaction information, entering it into an accounting system, and running relevant and accurate financial reports. The steps of the accounting cycle are:\n\nFinancial accounts have two different sets of rules they can choose to follow. The first, theaccrual basismethod of accounting, has been discussed above. These rules are outlined by GAAP and IFRS, are required by public companies, and are mainly used by larger companies.\n\nThe second set of rules follows thecash basismethod of accounting. Instead of recording a transaction when it occurs, the cash method stipulates a transaction should be recorded only when cash has been exchanged.\n\nBecause of the simplified manner of accounting, the cash method is often used by small businesses or entities that are not required to use the accrual method of accounting.\n\nImagine a company buys $1,000 of inventory on credit. Payment is due for the inventory in 30 days.\n\nThe difference between these two accounting methods is the treatment of accruals. Naturally, under the accrual method of accounting, accruals are required. Under the cash method, accruals are not required and not recorded.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission has an entire financial reporting manual outlining the reporting requirements of public companies.\n\nAccounting is a back-office function where employees may not directly interface with customers, product developers, or manufacturing. However, accounting plays a key role in the strategic planning, growth, and compliance requirements of a company.\n\nTo illustrate double-entry accounting, imagine a business sending an invoice to one of its clients. An accountant using the double-entry method records a debit to accounts receivables, which flows through to the balance sheet, and a credit to sales revenue, which flows through to the income statement.\n\nWhen the client pays the invoice, the accountant credits accounts receivables and debits cash. Double-entry accounting is also called balancing the books, as all of the accounting entries are balanced against each other. If the entries aren't balanced, the accountant knows there must be a mistake somewhere in the general ledger.\n\nAccounting is the profession of tracking the assets or cash flows of a company or other large organization, and recording how its finances spent. Accounting statements are regularly used by management, investors, and tax authorities to get a clear picture of how well an organization is managing its finances.\n\nBecause their reports are regularly scrutinized by oversight agencies, accountants are required to adhere to a uniform set of accounting standards. These rules specify how to record income, expenditures, assets, and losses, so that auditors have an objective view of the organization's financial health.\n\nAccountants help businesses maintain accurate and timely records of their finances. Accountants are responsible for maintaining records of a company\u2019s daily transactions and compiling those transactions into financial statements such as the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Accountants also provide other services, such as performing periodic audits or preparing ad-hoc management reports.\n\nAccountants hail from a wide variety of backgrounds. Generally speaking, however, attention to detail is a key component in accountancy, since accountants must be able to diagnose and correct subtle errors or discrepancies in a company\u2019s accounts. The ability to think logically is also essential, to help with problem-solving. Mathematical skills are helpful but are less important than in previous generations due to the wide availability of computers and calculators.\n\nThe work performed by accountants is at the heart of modern financial markets. Without accounting, investors would be unable to rely on timely or accurate financial information, and companies\u2019 executives would lack the transparency needed to manage risks or plan projects. Regulators also rely on accountants for critical functions such as providingauditors\u2019 opinionson companies\u2019 annual 10-K filings. In short, although accounting is sometimes overlooked, it is absolutely critical for the smooth functioning of modern finance.\n\nAccounting is by far one of the most important and prevalent fields in the world today. Its use in organizing business transactions and meeting regulatory requirements makes it a field that requires extensive knowledge and study. As such, accountants make strong salaries and work in a variety of industries.\n\nGary J.
