  "definition": "The accounting cycle is a collective process of identifying, analyzing, and recording theaccounting eventsof a company. It is a standard 8-step process that begins when a transaction occurs and ends with its inclusion in the financial statements and the closing of the books.\n\nThe key steps in the eight-step accounting cycle include recording journal entries, posting to the general ledger, calculating trial balances, making adjusting entries, and creating financial statements.\n\nThe accounting cycle is a methodical set of rules that can help ensure the accuracy and conformity offinancial statements. Computerized accounting systems and the uniform process of the accounting cycle have helped to reduce mathematical errors.\n\nToday, most software fully automates the accounting cycle, which results in less human effort and errors associated with manual processing.\n\nThere areeight steps to the accounting cycle.\n\nAn accounting cycle is used by most but not all businesses. Sole proprietorships, other small businesses, and entrepreneurs may not follow it.\n\nThe accounting cycle is started and completed within anaccounting period, the time in which financial statements are prepared. Accounting periods vary and depend on different factors. However, the most common type of accounting period is the annual period.\n\nDuring the accounting cycle, many transactions occur and are recorded. At the end of the fiscal year, financial statements are prepared (and are often required by government regulation).\n\nFor example, public entities are required to submit financial statements by certain dates. All public companies that do business in the U.S. are required to file registration statements, periodic reports, and other forms to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Therefore, their accounting cycles are tied to reporting requirement dates.\n\nThe accounting cycle is different from the budget cycle. The accounting cycle focuses on historical events and ensures that incurred financial transactions are reported correctly.\n\nAlternatively, the budget cycle relates to future operating performance and planning for future transactions. The accounting cycle assists in producing information for external users, while the budget cycle is mainly used for internal management purposes.\n\nIt's important because it can help ensure that the financial transactions that occur throughout an accounting period are accurately and properly recorded and reported. This can provide businesses with a clear understanding of their financial health and ensure compliance with federal regulations.\n\nThe accounting cycle can aid a company in keeping accurate books (and not losing important financial information), analyzing financial events, preparing required financial statements, and, overall, managing a business successfully.\n\nUsually, accountants are employed to manage and conduct the accounting tasks required by the accounting cycle. If a small business or one-person shop is involved, the owner may handle the tasks, or outsource the work to an accounting firm.\n\nThe accounting cycle is a comprehensive accounting process that begins and ends in an accounting period. It involves eight steps that ensure the proper recording and reporting of financial transactions. Once a company's books are closed and the accounting cycle for a period ends, it begins anew with the next accounting period and financial transactions.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Filings & Forms.\"",
