  "definition": "Exploring the World's Largest Financial Market\n\nForex is short for \"foreign exchange,\" which refers to the market in world currencies.\n\nForex, a portmanteau of foreign and exchange, is where banks, businesses, governments, investors, and individuals buy or sell currencies. Whenever you purchase something in another currency or exchange cash to get the local money of your vacation destination, you\u2019re taking part in the forex orforeign exchange (FX) market. Businesses and individuals often do this while investors trade currencies to profit from fluctuatingexchange rates.\n\nForex is the largest and most liquid market in the world. Participants in this global electronic marketplace traded about $7.5 trillion per day in 2022, far exceeding the daily trading volumes of the world stock market.\n\nForex is an over-the-counter (OTC) market. There is no single centralized exchange like there is with stocks.\n\nTransactions are made over computer networks that connect traders all over the world. Currencies move among traders, often with the support of a broker. Since it's done electronically, there is typically no physical exchange of actual currencies.\n\nThe main markets are open 24 hours a day, five days a week, beginning Sunday at 5 p.m. ET and ending Friday at 5 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat happens during these sessions determines the value of the world\u2019s currencies or how much of x currency will buy how much of y currency. Currency prices, or exchange rates, are determined bysupply and demand, or, more specifically, the demand for one currency compared with another. The factors that affect demand for a currency include a country's economic growth, inflation, interest rates set by central banks, and political stability.\n\nThe chart above includes information on the size of different types of forex markets.\n\nIn the past, big companies, governments, and hedge funds dominated the foreign exchange market. Today, currency trading is much easier for retail investors. Here are the major players in the market:\n\nIn the forex market, currencies are traded inpairs. That means when you buy one currency you are simultaneously selling another one\u2014and vice versa.\n\nFor each currency pair, there is an exchange rate, indicating how much of thequote currencyis needed to buy one unit of thebase currency.\n\nFor example, one of the most popular currency pairs isEUR/USD, which is short for the euro and U.S. dollar. If the exchange rate for this currency pair is 1.10, it means one euro can be exchanged for 1.10 U.S. dollars.\n\nXE.com is one of the most popular places to obtain live exchange rates. If you use its platform, you\u2019ll be given the option to input an amount in a selected currency and convert it to another currency at the current exchange rate.\n\nHow you trade forex depends a lot on your familiarity with currencies and trading. Here\u2019s how a beginner can get started in steps:\n\nLet\u2019s say you think the U.S. dollar will strengthen in value against the euro. Suppose the USD/EUR is trading at 0.90, meaning one U.S. dollar is worth 0.90 euros, and you think it could soon reach parity, meaning one U.S. dollar would buy one euro.\n\nYour rationale is based on studying recent moves in the market and EU-American trade discussions overtariffs. Based on this conviction, you exchange 900 euros for $1,000.\n\nLater, the exchange rate changes to 0.98, meaning one dollar now buys 0.98 euros. If you were to cash in at that moment and exit the trade, you would walk away with 980 euros, minus fees, representing an $80 profit.\n\nLet\u2019s assume you stayed in the trade, and the tables turned. After a few more weeks, the euro surged against the dollar, pushing the exchange rate all the way down to 0.85. Now, your original 900 euros would be worth 850 euros, which is a loss, even without factoring in trading fees.\n\nLike any investing market, forex trading offers bothrisksand benefits.\n\nSome of the biggest draws are its long opening hours, high liquidity, and all-around accessibility. With forex trading, it\u2019s possible to invest even small amounts and useleverage(borrow to augment your trades), and transaction costs are generally low.\n\nRisks include how easy it is to use leverage and engage in complex trades in a market known for its volatility. The fact the forex market is decentralized, with no central exchange guaranteeing a trade, adds to this danger. Forex offers a lot more flexibility. But that comes at the cost of less regulation.\n\nThe forex market is used not just to exchange currencies but also to speculate on their future directions, including through futures and options contracts and by using leverage. Today, many retail investors trade throughonline brokers.\n\nThe forex market is known for its accessibility, with low fees, high liquidity, and low minimum investment requirements. However, it's also extremely volatile and can be risky for novices and experts alike.\n\nIG Bank. \u201cThe Main Differences Between Forex and Stock Trading.\"\n\nBIS. \"OTC Foreign Exchange Turnover in April 2022.\"\n\nFOREX.com. \u201cMarket Hours and Holidays.\u201d",
