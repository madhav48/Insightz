  "term": "What Is Land? Definition in Business, Valuation, and Main Uses",
  "definition": "Land, in the business sense, can refer toreal estateor property without buildings and equipment that is designated by fixed spatial boundaries.\n\nLand ownership might offer the titleholder the right to any natural resources that exist within the boundaries of their land.\n\nIn traditional economics, land is a factor of production, along with capital and labor. The sale of land results in acapital gainor loss.\n\nUnder Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax laws, land is not adepreciable assetand qualifies as afixed assetinstead of a current asset.\n\nThe basic concept of land is that it is a specific area of earth,propertywith clearly delineated boundaries, that has an owner. You can view the concept of land in different ways, depending on its context, and the circumstances\u00a0under which it's being analyzed.\n\nWhen one owns land, one owns the surface area and everything on it, such as trees, buildings, and animals. One also owns the area below and the airspace above its boundaries.\n\nLegally and economically, a piece of land is afactor in some form of production. Although the land is not consumed during this production, no other production\u2014food, for example\u2014would be possible without it. Therefore, we may consider land as a resource with nocost of production.\n\nDespite the fact that\u00a0people can always change the land use to be less or more profitable, we cannot increase its supply.\n\nLand ownership can be transferred by the terms of a will, by deed, when given as a gift, and through a business transaction.\n\nLand can include anything that's on, under, or above the ground. This means that buildings, trees, and water that are a part of land are an asset.\n\nThe term \"land\" encompasses all physical elements bestowed by nature on a specific area or piece of property\u2014the environment, fields, forests, minerals, climate, animals, and bodies or sources of water.\n\nA landowner may be entitled to a wealth ofnatural resourceson their property, including plants, human and animal life, soil, minerals, geographical location, electromagnetic features, and geophysical occurrences.\n\nLendersof money are extremely attracted to land because it is one of the oldest forms ofcollateral. And unlike a home or a car, land for the most part cannot be moved or stolen.\n\nAir and space rights\u2014both above and below a property\u2014attach to ownership. However,\u00a0the right to use the\u00a0air and space above land\u00a0may be subject to height limitations\u00a0dictated by\u00a0local ordinances, as well as state and federal laws.\n\nLand value is the amount of money that a piece of land is worth. This value can be arrived at by an independent real estate appraiser. Land valuation can be one of a variety of important indicators of a community's financial well-being.\n\nPrecise land valuation plays a role in various types of financial activities, including real estate transactions, local government taxes, and property investments. Land must be valued properly in order for these activities to occur and for buyers and sellers to have confidence in them.\n\nLand valuation can also help landowners deal effectively with those who wish to enter a business transaction with them to make use of their land. Knowing the land value and the expenses associated with ownership (in addition to the type of use sought) can help the landowner pinpoint what to charge.\n\nLand valuation can be affected by a property's location, climate, size, condition, the physical structures on it, the natural resources contained within its boundaries (such as the presence of water, minerals, or oil), and more.\n\nFor example, land near a city, public transportation, healthcare facilities, schools, supermarkets and other shopping, and a variety of other businesses as opposed to being far from such attractions can command a higher valuation.\n\nThat's because the location can make the land more appealing to those who might want to live in the house that's on it or to those who might wish to develop it for residential or commercial purposes. The greater the appeal, the higher the land's valuation could be.\n\nAs for natural resources affecting valuation, take gas and oil. Because natural gas and oil in the U.S. are beingdepleted, the land that contains these resources can be of greatvalue. In many cases, drilling and oil companies pay landowners substantial sums of money for the right to use their land to access such natural resources, particularly if the land is rich in a specific one.\n\nLand use refers to the use of land by human beings for their business and cultural activities. Land's primary use is for residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, agricultural, and tranportational purposes.\n\nOngoing land use can affect thecondition of the land, its natural resources, and the environment. These condition changes in turn can pose problems for the health of humans and other animals living on the land as well as the viability of the land itself. Agriculture and development uses are areas of concern for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nLand use is governed by municipal regulations and localzoninglaws. Town and city planners and other organizations focus on how land is used to understand the outcomes of such use. They can then provide guidance for its future use and potentially effect change in land use laws.\n\nLand's main economic benefit is its scarcity. Many investorspurchase land with the intent of developing it. Development can be for commercial or residential use and is subject to the aforementioned zoning ordinances and local regulations.\n\nRaw land investmentscan produce\u00a0significant future cash flows that are easy to predict once secured. But developing land can be very costly and uncertain. The associatedrisksof developing land can stem\u00a0from taxation, regulatory usage restrictions, leasing and selling a property, political events, and even natural disasters.\n\nIn economics, land is considered a factor of production similar to labor as one of the crucial elements in creating goods and services. Land resources, specifically, are raw materials in the production process, such as trees, oil, and metals.\n\nOwning land is important because it is a source of wealth. Land can be harvested and the materials grown on it sold for profit. Factories, warehouses, and buildings that will facilitate business can be built on land. Land can be leased in return for income. Land is also a tangible good that does not depreciate. In addition, land cannot easily be tampered with, in that there is nothing to steal from it (for the most part). It can be polluted and/or destroyed, but that can be prevented to a degree.\n\nThe main uses of land are for transportation, residences, commercial activity, production, agriculture, and recreation.\n\nLand is considered real estate or property defined by specific borders. It can serve a commercial purpose and be seen as a factor of production. And it can serve a residential purpose, supporting people with shelter and other buildings and attachments.\n\nInvestors may be interested in land for its development potential or the existing commercial activities taking place on it. Land development as an investment has its hazards due to the risks related to local regulations, taxes, political situations, and natural disasters.\n\nLegal Explanations. \"Land Definition and Legal Meaning.\"\n\nLegal Information Institute. \"Land.\"\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. \"Land Use.\"",
