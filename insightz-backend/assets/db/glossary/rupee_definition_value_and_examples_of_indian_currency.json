It's denoted by the symbol \u20b9and is subdivided into 100 paise.\n\nThe primary medium of exchange in India is the rupee (INR). It was introduced as a silver coin by Sher Shah Suri in the 16th century. The rupee then became afiat currencyunder British colonial rule. Now it's another currency within the modern monetary system and is managed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).\n\nThe currency exists in various denominations and incorporates security features to prevent counterfeiting. While the rupee is not a significantreserve currencyelsewhere, neighboring nations like Nepal and Bhutan peg their currencies to it, highlighting its regional importance.\n\nIndia's currency is managed within the world currency market'sfloating exchange ratesystem. Thus, the value of the rupee changes based on economic and financial market factors. While the rupee is freely convertible for trade and remittances, capital account transactions are restricted to manage economic stability, and the RBI intervenes from time to time to curb too much volatility.\n\nIndia's financial landscape has evolved with the rapid shift to digital payments through platforms andmobile wallets. This reduces the reliance on cash and improves financial transparency. Although the rupee faces challenges like depreciation risks, inflationary pressures, and external debt exposure, growing foreign exchange reserves and increasing foreign direct investment (FDI) provide stability.\n\nEfforts to internationalize the rupee, including promoting rupee-based trade and developing acentral bank digital currency (CBDC), indicate India's commitment to strengthening its financial system.\n\nA CBDC is a digital form of a country's fiat currency that is issued and regulated by the nation's central bank.\n\nHistorically, the rupee has depreciated because of higher inflation, trade deficits, and structural economic challenges. This is despite structural reforms such as increasing manufacturing, exports, and foreign investment that have worked to strengthen the rupee.\n\nMultiple economic, financial, and geopolitical factors affect the rupee's value. Nonetheless, because of its managed floating rate system, the RBI can enter the market to prevent extreme volatility. Some of the factors include the following:\n\nThe rupee comes in various forms including coins and banknotes, all of which are legal tender across India. The banknotes display Mahatma Gandhi and have sophisticated security features like watermarks and color-shifting ink to prevent counterfeiting. Each note has a distinct color and design, making it easily recognizable.\n\nThe rupee is a key part of India's economy, evolving alongside the nation's rapid growth and modernization. As a currency governed by a managed floating exchange rate, its value is shaped by a mix of domestic and global economic forces, from inflation and interest rates to trade balances and foreign investments.\n\nWhile the rupee has experienced long-term depreciation, strong foreign exchange reserves and strategic RBI interventions have helped stabilize its short-term fluctuations. With India's push toward digitalization, financial inclusion, and internationalization efforts, the currency is gradually adapting to a dynamic global financial system.\n\nMintage World. \"Sher Shah Suri's Silver Rupee.\"\n\nCentral Banking. \"India Reports Hundredfold Growth in Digital Payments Since 2012.\"\n\nReserve Bank of India. \"Digital Rupee FAQ.\"\n\nReserve Bank of India. \"Indian Currency.\"",
