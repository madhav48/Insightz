  "term": "Covered Calls: How They Work and How to Use Them in Investing",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA covered call is a sale of call options by a seller who owns shares in the underlying assets and therefore could deliver them if the options are exercised by the buyer.\n\nA covered call is a sale of call options by a seller who owns shares in the underlying stock or other asset. The seller is creating an additional stream of income by collecting options premiums while continuing to hold onto the stock shares. At worst, the investor would have to hand over the shares if the options are exercised.\n\nThe covered call options strategy is generally used when the seller intends to own the shares for the long term but does not expect them to increase in value sharply before the option expires.\n\nCovered calls are a neutral strategy, meaning the investor onlyexpects a minor increase or decrease\u00a0in the underlyingstock price for the life of the written call option. This strategy is often employed when an investor has a short-term neutral view of the asset and, for this reason, holds the asset long and simultaneously has ashort positionvia the option to generate income from theoption premium.\n\nSimply put, if an investor intends to hold the underlying stock for a long time but does not expect an appreciable price increase in the near term, then they can generate income (premiums) for their account while they wait out the lull.\n\nA covered call serves as a short-termhedgeon a long stock position and allows investors to earn income via the premium received for writing the option. However, the investor forfeits stock gains if the price moves above the option'sstrike price. They are also\u00a0obligated to provide 100 shares at the strike price (for each contract written) if the buyer chooses toexercisethe option.\n\nThemaximum profit of a covered callis equivalent to the premium received for the options sold plus the potential upside in the stock between the current price and the strike price. Thus, if the call is written with a strike price of $100 on a stock trading at $90, and the writer receives a premium of $1.00 per stock, the maximum potential profit per stock is the $1.00 premium plus a $10 appreciation of the stock\u2014or a total of $1100.\n\nThe maximum loss, on the other hand, is equivalent to the purchase price of the underlying stock less the premium received. This is because the stock could potentially drop to zero, in which case allyou would receive is the premium for the options sold.\n\nIf the investor simultaneously buys a stock and writes call options against that position, it is known as a buy-write transaction.\n\nAn options writercan earn money by selling a covered call, but they lose the potential profits if the call goes into the money. However, the writer must be able to produce 100 shares for each contract if the call expires in the money. If they do not have enough shares, they must buy them on the open market, causing them to lose even more money.\n\nCovering calls can limit the maximum losses from an options transaction, but it also limits the possible profits. This makes thema useful strategyfor institutional funds and traders because it allows them to quantify their maximum losses before entering into a position.\n\nA covered call strategy isn't useful for verybullishor verybearishinvestors.Very bullish investors are typically better off not writing the option and just holding the stock. The option caps the profit on the stock, which could reduce the overall profit of the trade if the stock price spikes.\n\nCovered options limit the risks and potential downsides of an options contract.\n\nOptions writers can earn a reliable premium from a small price increase.\n\nOptions writers must be able to produce 100 shares for each call option that expires in the money.\n\nIf an investor is very bullish on a security, they can make more money from uncovered calls or buying the underlying security.\n\nThe best time to sell covered calls is when the underlying security has neutral to optimistic long-term prospects, with little likelihood of either large gains or large losses. This allows thecall writer to earn a reliable profitfrom the premium.\n\nCovered calls are not an optimal strategy if the underlying security has a high chance of large price swings. If the price rises higher than expected, the call writer would miss out on any profits above the strike price. If the price falls, the options writer could stand to lose the entire price of the security minus the initial premium.\n\nOne closely related strategy to covered calls is the cash-secured put, which is effectively the mirror image of a covered call. In this approach, an investor agrees to buy a stock at a predetermined strike price by selling aput option, while setting aside sufficient cash to purchase it if the option is assigned. This strategy generates premium income upfront, just like a covered call. However, it's used when the investor is willing to buy the stock at a lower price and is neutral to slightly bullish on the underlying asset.\n\nAnother alternative is the collar strategy, which combines a covered call with a protective put. Here, an investor holds the stock, sells a call, and buys a put. While this reduces the income received compared to a simple covered call, it offers more downside protection compared to just a covered call.\n\nLast, for investors wanting greater complexity, diagonal spreads may be worth exploring. A diagonal call spread involves buying a longer-term call option while selling a shorter-term call at a different strike price. This allows the investor to benefit from time decay andvolatilitychanges.\n\nThe covered call roll, sometimes referred to as \"rolling\", is a tactical adjustment to an existing covered call position. It involves closing out the current call option and simultaneously opening a new call position with different terms. There are several ways it can be done.\n\nOne common version is rolling up, which means closing a lower-strike call and opening a new one at a higher strike price. This is usually done when the underlying stock has risen significantly, and the original call is deep in the money. By rolling up, the investor can recapture some additional upside potential that would have otherwise been capped while still collecting new premium.\n\nMeanwhile, rolling down is a moredefensivemaneuver used when the stock price has fallen. Here, the investor buys back the original call and sells a new one at a lower strike price. This reduces potential upside but brings in a higher premium relative to the current stock price.\n\nLastly, rolling out refers to extending the expiration date of the call option. This is often done as the current call nears expiration and the investor wants to maintain the position while continuing togenerate income. Rolling out can be combined with rolling up or down to adjust both strike and time simultaneously.\n\nLet's say an investor owns shares of\u00a0a hypothetical company\u00a0called TSJ. Although the investor likes its long-term prospects and its share price, they feel the stock will likely trade relatively flat in the shorter term, perhaps within a couple of dollars of itscurrent priceof\u00a0$25.\n\nIf they sell acall optionon TSJ with a strike price of $27, they earn thepremiumfrom the option sale but, for the duration of the option, cap their\u00a0upside on the stock to $27. Assume the premium they receive for writing\u00a0a three-month call option is $0.75 ($75 per contract or 100 shares). One of two scenarios will play out:\n\nAs with any trading strategy, covered calls may or may not be profitable. The highest payoff from a covered call occurs if the stock price rises to the strike price of the call that has been sold and is no higher. The investor benefits from a modest rise in the stock and collects the full premium of the option as it expires worthless. Like any strategy,covered call writinghas advantages and disadvantages. If used with the right stock, covered calls can be a great way to reduce your average cost or generate income.\n\nCovered calls are consideredrelatively low risk. Covered calls, however, would limit any further upside profit potential if the stock continued to rise, and would not protect much from a drop in the stock price.Note that, unlike covered calls, call sellers that do not own an equivalent amount in the underlying\u00a0shares arenaked callwriters. Naked short calls have theoretically unlimited loss potential if\u00a0the underlying security rises.\n\nDepending on the custodian of your IRA and your eligibility to trade options with them, yes. There are also certain advantages to using covered calls in an IRA. The possibility of triggering a reportablecapital gainmakes covered call writing a good strategy for either atraditionalorRoth IRA. Investors can buy back the stock at an appropriate price without having to worry about tax consequences, as well as generate additional income that can either be taken as\u00a0distributions\u00a0or\u00a0reinvested.\n\nIn contrast to call options, put options grant the contract holder the right to sell the underlying (as opposed to the right to buy it) at a set price.The equivalent position using puts would involve selling short shares and then selling a downside put. This, however, is uncommon. Instead, traders may employ amarried put, where an investor, holding a\u00a0long position\u00a0in a stock, purchases aput optionon the same stock to protect against depreciation in the stock's price.\n\nA covered call is an options trading strategy that allows an investor to profit from anticipated price rises. To make a covered call, the call writer offers to sell some of their securities at a pre-arranged price sometime in the future. This strategy offers lower upsides than other options strategies, but also offers lower risk.\n\nCorrection\u2014June 18, 2024:This article has been corrected to state the maximum potential profit of a covered call in the example above.\n\nCME Group Education. \"Covered Calls.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Investor Bulletin: An Introduction to Options.\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"Covered Call (Buy/Write).\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"Naked Call (Uncovered Call, Short Call).\"\n\nOptions Clearing Corporation. \"Covered Put.\"",
