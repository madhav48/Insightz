  "definition": "A monopsony is a market condition in which there is only one buyer, the monopsonist. Like amonopoly, a monopsony also has imperfect market conditions. The difference between amonopoly and a monopsonylies in the difference between the controlling entities. An individual seller controls a monopolized market while a single buyer dominates a monopsony. Monopsonists are common in areas where they supply most or all of the region's jobs.\n\nIn a monopsony, a large buyer controls themarket. Because of their unique position, monopsonies have a wealth of power. For example, being the primary or only supplier of jobs in an area, the monopsony has the power to set wages. In addition, they have bargaining power as they can negotiate prices and terms with their suppliers.\n\nMonopsonies take many different forms and may occur in all types of markets. For example, Ernest and Julio Gallo, a conglomerate of wineries and wine producers, had so much power within the wine market that it has been deemed a monopsony.The company is so large and has so much buying power over grape growers that grape wholesalers\u00a0have no choice but to lower prices and agree to the company's terms.\n\nMonopsony is derived from two Greek words:monos(single) andopsonia(purchase).\n\nA monopsony is unique to other forms of market situation with distinctive market features. Some of these characteristics are below.\n\nIn a monopsony, there is only one buyer, which gives them significant market power and control over the price and quantity of goods or services purchased. If more than one buyer is present, it is not a monopsony. For this reason, there's usually natural or built-in limitations to the market that make it unfeasible or impossible for there to be other buyers.\n\nDue to there being a single buyer that holds a majority of power, monopsonies mean sellers are relatively weak and have reduced bargaining power. This usually results in lower prices and lower quantities sold. Though there may be multiple suppliers or sellers, they usually have collective less ability to control the market compared to what the buyer can impose.\n\nMarket inefficienciesarise when the single consumer buys less of the good or service than would be produced in a more competitive market. This may force producers to cutwages, store unsold inventory that would have otherwise been consumed in a \"normal\" market, or reduce prices to unprofitable levels.\n\nSince the buyer has significant control over the market, there is less incentive for suppliers to invest in innovation or quality improvements. Even if the producers were to innovate or find better ways to produce a good, they may not be rewarded by a competitive market through better margins or higher prices. Therefore, monopsonies are most detrimental to the long-term growth as it tends to stunt innovative thinking.\n\nThere are several scenarios where a monopsony can occur. Like a monopoly, a monopsony also does not adhere to standard pricing from balancingsupply-side and demand-sidefactors.\n\nA monopsony can arise in a market that is geographically isolated or where transportation costs are high. This can limit the number of potential buyers and make it difficult for competitors to enter the market. This may also make it hard for market participants outside of the geographic region to ship goods into a physical area.\n\nWhen there is limited demand for a good or service, there may only be one buyer willing to purchase the product, resulting in a monopsony. Consider agriculture in developing countries. The goods produced in these extremely rural areas often can't be shipped around the world. For this reason, this type of agriculture (and its associated shipping restrictions) is often only demanded by local governments or local food processing companies.\n\nHighbarriers to entry, such as regulations or high capital requirements, can make it difficult for new buyers to enter the market and compete with the existing buyer. This may be true in situations where a buyer must be credentialed, hold certain permits, or meet exclusive criteria.\n\nA monopsony can result from market consolidation where several buyers merge and control a significant share of the market. Consider how the merger oftelecommunicationgiants T-Mobile and Sprint caused changes on the demand side of business.Instead of there being two different buyers, the post-merger market resulted in just one company (but still potentially buying the same amount of goods).\n\nIn some cases, government policies or regulations may lead to a monopsony in a particular market. For example, if the government is the only buyer of a particular product, it can create a monopsony. In addition, governments may enter into contracts that restrict who sellers can contract with or the quantities the producer may supply to broad markets.\n\nMonopsony can also be common in labor markets when a single employer has an advantage over the workforce. When this happens, the wholesalers, in this case, the potential employees, agree to a lower wage because of factors resulting from the buying company\u2019s control. This wage control drives down the cost to the employer and increasesprofit margins.\n\nThe technology engineering market offers one example of wage suppression. With only a few large tech companies in the market requiring\u00a0engineers, major players have been accused of\u00a0conspiring on wages to minimize labor costs so that the major tech companies can generate higher profits. This example illustrates a sort of oligopsony in which multiple companies are involved.\n\nEconomists and policymakers have increasingly become concerned with the domination of just a handful of highly successful companies controlling an outsized market share in a given industry.\n\nThey fear these industry giants will influence pricing power and exert their ability to suppress industry-wide wages. Indeed, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan and nonprofit think tank, the gap between productivity and wage growth has been increasing over the last 50 years with productivity outpacing wages by more than six times.\n\nMonopsony and monopoly are two sides of the same coin. While monopsony refers to one buyer in a market of multiple sellers, monopoly refers to one seller in a market of multiple buyers. Monopsony is about demand while monopoly is about supply.\n\nIn 2018, economists Alan Krueger and Eric Posner authored \"A Proposal for Protecting Low\u2011Income Workers from Monopsony and Collusion\" for\u00a0The Hamilton Project,\u00a0which argued thatlabor marketcollusion or monopsonization might contribute to wage stagnation, rising inequality, and declining productivity in the American economy.\n\nThey proposed a series of reforms to protect workers and strengthen the labor market. Those reforms include forcing the federal government to provide enhanced scrutiny of mergers for adverse labor market effects, banning non-compete covenants that bind low-wage workers, and prohibiting no-poaching arrangements among establishments that belong to a single franchise company.\n\nIn April 2024, theFederal Trade Commission (FTC)voted to ban non-compete agreements in employment contracts.A federal judge in Texas blocked the FTC's move in August 2024, calling the ban unlawful.\n\nA monopoly is a market situation where there is only one seller or producer of a particular good or service. This gives that seller considerable power to control prices and output. Meanwhile, a monopsony is a market situation where there is only one buyer of a particular good or service. Monopsony power arises when the buyer has the ability to lower the price of a product or service by reducing the quantity they purchase.\n\nThe difference between a monopsony and monopoly is the aspect of trade that is being controlled. While a monopoly has exclusive control over the supply of a good or service, a monopsony has exclusive control over the demand for that good or service. A monopoly leads to the producers have excess power, while a monopsony leads to a consumer having excess power.\n\nBoth a monopoly and monopsony can lead to market inefficiencies. However, each results in different inefficiencies that arise in different ways. For example, in a monopoly, consumers face higher prices. In a monopsony, workers may be forced to take on lower wages as a result in imposed lower prices.\n\nTake the example of acoal factoryin a coal mining town, an oft-cited example of a monopsony. A coal factory sets up shop in an area where there is no civil life or residents. The company attracts workers and a town builds up around the factory where the majority of the employees work.\n\nThe factory is the only real employer in town, it can set wages belowmarket prices, and determine how many individuals will be employed at any time. This has a ripple effect on the rest of the community, such as the other types of businesses set up in town, the amount they can charge, and how many people they can hire.\n\nIf the coal factory went bust and closed, there would be no jobs, and therefore, no demand for any of the other goods and services sold by the businesses in the town. But because the coal factory is the only real employer, its wages can be unfair and its working conditions poor and unsafe, yet people will still seek to work there.\n\nThe three primary characteristics of a monopsony are (1) one firm purchasing all of the goods and services in a market, (2) no other buyers in the market, and (3) barriers to entry into the market.\n\nThe primary advantage of a monopsony goes towards the single buyer in the market, allowing for a controlling advantage that decreases the price levels of the good or service being bought. This reduction in price allows for a reduction in costs that can be passed on elsewhere.\n\nSome experts do consider Amazon to be a monopsony as it has become the largest, and sometimes, only buyer in its market of specific goods and services that it then sells on its platform. Because it is the only buyer, primarily because it controls the largest platform to sell certain goods, it can dictate the prices in which it pays for those goods and services it then sells.\n\nA monopsony is a market condition in which there is only one buyer. Because there is only one buyer for a good or service, the buyer sets the demand, and therefore, controls the price. Monopsonies, like monopolies, are inefficient to a free market, where supply and demand regulate prices to be fair for consumers.\n\nAAWE. \"Ernest Gallo, 1909\u20132007: A Life in Wine*,\" Page 113.\n\nT-Mobile. \"Sprint Is Now Part of the Family.\"\n\nEconomic Policy Institute. \"The Productivity\u2013Pay Gap.\"\n\nBrookings. \"A Proposal for Protecting Low\u2011Income Workers\u00a0from Monopsony and Collusion.\"\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"FTC Announces Rule Banning Noncompetes.\"\n\nKennedys. \"The FTC\u2019s effort for a non-compete ban has been judicially struck down, however, its fate still hangs in the balance.\"",
