  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nZero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a method of budgeting in which allexpensesmust be justified for each new period. The process begins from a \u201czero base\u201d and every function within an organization is analyzed for its needs and costs. The budgets are then built around what's needed for the upcoming period regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the last one.\n\nZBB allows top-level strategic goals to be implemented into the budgeting process by tying them to specific functional areas of the organization. Costs can then be first grouped and then measured against previous results and current expectations.\n\nZero-based budgeting can be a rolling process done over several years with a few functional areas reviewed by managers or group leaders at a time because of its detail-oriented nature. It can help lower costs by avoiding blanket increases or decreases to a prior period\u2019s budget but it's a time-consuming process that takes much longer than traditional, cost-based budgeting.\n\nThe practice favors areas that achieve direct revenues or production because their contributions are more easily justifiable\u00a0than in departments such as client service andresearch and development.\n\nZero-based budgeting is primarily used in business but it can be used by individuals and families, too.\n\nTraditional budgeting calls for incremental increases over previous budgets such as a 2% increase in spending. Zero-based budgeting requires a justification of both old and new expenses.\n\nTraditional budgeting also only analyzes new expenditures.ZBB starts from zeroand calls for a justification of old, recurring expenses in addition to new expenditures. Zero-based budgeting aims to put the onus on managers to justify expenses. It drives value for an organization byoptimizingcosts, not just revenue.\n\nSuppose a construction equipment company implements a zero-based budgeting process calling for closer scrutiny of manufacturing department expenses. The company notices that the cost of certain parts used in its final products and outsourced to another manufacturer increases by 5% every year.\n\nThe company can manufacture those parts in-house using its workers. It finds after weighing the positives and negatives of in-house manufacturing that it can make the parts cheaper than the outside supplier.\n\nThe company can identify\u00a0a situation in which it can decide to make the part itself or buy the part from the external supplier for its end products instead of blindly increasing the budget by a certain percentage and masking the cost increase,\n\nTraditional budgeting may not allowcost driverswithin departments to be identified but zero-based budgeting is a more granular process that aims to identify and justify expenditures. Zero-based budgeting is also more involved, however, so the costs of the process itself must be weighed against the savings it might identify.\n\nZero-based budgeting was created in the late 1960s by former Texas Instruments account manager Peter Pyhrr.\n\nZero-based budgeting starts at zero, unlike traditional budgeting. It justifies each expense for a reporting period.\n\nZero-based budgeting starts from scratch, analyzing each granular need of the company instead of using the incremental budgeting increases found in traditional budgeting. This essentially allows for a strategic, top-down approach to analyze the performance of a given project.\n\nZero-based budgeting offers several advantages, including focused operations, lower costs, budget flexibility, and strategic execution. The highest revenue-generating operations come into greater focus when managers think about how each dollar is spent. Lowered costs may result because zero-based budgeting may prevent the misallocation of resources that can happen over time when a budget grows incrementally.\n\nZero-based budgeting has several disadvantages. It's time- and resource-intensive. The time cost involved may not be worthwhile because a new budget is developed each period. Using a modified budget template instead may prove more beneficial.\n\nZBB may reward short-term perspectives in the company by allocating more resources to operations with the highest revenues. Areas such as research and development or those that have a long-term horizon, may be overlooked as a result.\n\nZero-based budgeting (ZBB) justifies all expenses for each new period. The process begins from a \u201czero base,\u201d analyzing every function within an organization for its needs and costs. Budgets are then built around what's needed for the upcoming period regardless of whether each budget is higher or lower than the one before.\n\nKPMG. \"Zero-Based Budgeting.\" Page 2.\n\nFlorida International University. \u201cZero-Base Budgeting.\u201d Page 5.\n\nCFI Education. \"Zero-Based Budgeting.\"",
