  "definition": "The expenditure method is a system for calculating gross domestic product (GDP) that combines consumption, investment, government spending, andnet exports. It is the most common way to estimate GDP.\n\nThe method posits that everything that the private sector and the government spend within the borders of a particular country add up to the total value of all finished goods and services produced over a certain period of time. This method producesnominal GDP, which must then be adjusted forinflationto result in the real GDP.\n\nThe expenditure method may be contrasted with theincome approachfor calculating GDP, which focuses on total income earned.\n\nThe expenditure method for calculating GDP is similar to the formula for calculating aggregate demand. That's becauseaggregate demandrepresents total spending for goods and services within an economy. As such, aggregate demand and expenditure-based GDP fall and rise largely in tandem.\n\nHowever, this isn't always the case in the real world, especially when looking at GDP over the long run. Short-run aggregate demand only measures total output for a single nominal price level, or the average of current prices across the entire spectrum of goods and services produced in the economy. Aggregate demand only equals GDP in the long run after adjusting for price level.\n\nThe expenditure method is the most widely used approach for estimating GDP, a measure of the economy's output irrespective of who owns the means to production. The GDP under this method is calculated by summing up all of the expenditures made on final goods and services. There are four main aggregate expenditures that go into calculating GDP: consumption by households, investment by businesses, government spending on goods and services, and net exports, which are equal to exports minus imports of goods and services.\n\nThe formula for expenditure GDP is:\n\nGDP=C+I+G+(X\u2212M)where:C=Consumer\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0goods\u00a0and\u00a0servicesI=Investor\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0business\u00a0capital\u00a0goodsG=Government\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0public\u00a0goods\u00a0and\u00a0servicesX=ExportsM=Imports\\begin{aligned}&GDP=C+I+G+(X-M)\\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&C=\\text{Consumer spending on goods and services}\\\\&I=\\text{Investor spending on business capital goods}\\\\&G=\\text{Government spending on public goods and services}\\\\&X=\\text{Exports}\\\\&M=\\text{Imports}\\end{aligned}\u200bGDP=C+I+G+(X\u2212M)where:C=Consumer\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0goods\u00a0and\u00a0servicesI=Investor\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0business\u00a0capital\u00a0goodsG=Government\u00a0spending\u00a0on\u00a0public\u00a0goods\u00a0and\u00a0servicesX=ExportsM=Imports\u200b\n\nIn the United States, the most dominant component of GDP under the expenditure method isconsumer spending. Consumption is typically broken down into purchases of durable goods (such as cars and computers), nondurable goods (such as clothing and food),\u00a0and services.\n\nThe second component is government spending, which represents expenditures by state, local, and federal authorities on defense and nondefense goods and services, such as weaponry, health care, and education.\n\nBusiness investment is one of the most volatile components that goes into calculating GDP. It includescapital expendituresby firms onassetswith useful lives of more than one year each, such as real estate, equipment, production facilities, and plants.\n\nThe last component included in the expenditure approach is net exports, which represents the effect of foreign trade of goods and service on the economy.\n\nThe\u00a0income approach\u00a0to measuring\u00a0GDP is based on theaccountingreality that all expenditures in an economy should equal the total income generated by the production of all economic goods and services. It also assumes that there are four majorfactors of productionin an economy and that all revenues must go to one of these four sources. Therefore, by adding all of the sources of income together, a quick estimate can be made of the total productive value of economic activity over a period. Adjustments must then be made for taxes,depreciation, and foreign factor payments.\n\nThe major distinction between each approach is its starting point. The\u00a0expenditure approach begins with\u00a0the money spent on goods and services. Conversely, the income approach starts with the income earned\u2014such as wages, rents, interest, and profits\u2014from the production of goods and services.\n\nGDP is often used as an indicator of a country'sstandard of livingand economic health. Critics, such as the Nobel Prize-winning economistJoseph Stiglitz, caution that the measure should not be taken as an all-encompassing indicator of a society's well-being, since it ignores important factors that make people happy.\n\nFor example, while GDP includes monetary spending by private and government sectors, it does not consider work-life balance or the quality of interpersonal relationships in a given country.\n\nExpenditure is a broad term that encompasses any transaction in which a good or service is purchased. On an individual level, you may engage in various expenditures throughout a typical day, including buying a coffee, taking the bus, getting a hair cut, or renting an apartment. Business expenditures can include paying for both capital (such as a factory or warehouse) and labor (such as hiring workers).\n\nThe expenditure method formula for calculating GPD is straightforward. GDP is measured by adding the following: consumer expenditures, business expenditures, government expenditures, and net exports. Recall that net exports is total exports minus total imports.\n\nThe income method formula for calculating GDP is similar to the expenditure method. GDP is measured by adding the following: total national income, sales tax, depreciation, and net foreign factor income. Total national income refers to income from all sources, including wages, rent, interest, and others. Sales tax includes all consumer taxes charged by governments on goods and services. Depreciation is the cost allocated to a tangible asset over its useful life. Lastly, net foreign factor income is the difference between income generated by a country's citizens in foreign countries and the income generated by foreign citizens domestically.\n\nThe expenditure method is one system of estimating GDP. It takes into account the total value of all spending on goods and services in an economy, including consumer spending, government spending, business spending, and net exports. The method is often contrasted with the income method of calculating GDP, which focuses on income earned from the production of goods and services.",
