Bungalows were originally designed to provide affordable, modern housing for the working class.\n\nAlthough bungalows\u00a0are typically one-story houses, they often include an additional\u00a0half-story, usually with a sloped roof. There are various types of\u00a0bungalows, including raised\u00a0bungalows\u00a0with basements partially above ground to let in additional sunlight.\n\nSome bungalows do add additional levels, such as lofts and half levels. Standard features of the\u00a0bungalow\u00a0include a dormer window and a veranda.\n\nLearn more about what a bungalow is, the features of a bungalow, and whether this home style may be right for you.\n\nBungalows are single-level homes, cabins, or cottages. They are small and easy to maintain, making them great homes for aging adults orpeople with disabilities. Bungalows are also cost-efficient, as heating and cooling costs tend to be lower, and the property value tends to remain relatively high.\n\nCommon key features of a bungalow include:\n\nBecause bungalows\u00a0occupy more square footage on one floor than multi-story homes, they generally allow more space for modifications and additions. They also afford more privacy than most traditional homes, as they're low to the ground and trees, shrubs, and fences can easily block the windows.\n\nOn the other hand,\u00a0bungalows\u00a0tend to occupy a larger area of land than their multi-story counterparts. Since they don't extend upwards, they take up more square footage on the first floor. They may cost more per square foot and may also require more roofing material.\n\nBungalows\u00a0also tend to have smaller and fewer rooms extending off a larger living room instead of large bedrooms or an open floor plan. They're more susceptible to break-ins because they're low to the ground. So, consider investing in a home security system if you purchase a\u00a0bungalow.\n\nPopular bungalow styles include California, Chicago, and the chalet.\n\nBungalows\u00a0were first built in the South Asian region of Bengal.\u00a0Bungalows, which derive their name from Hindi, were first identified as such by British sailors of the East India Company in the 18th\u00a0century.

For example, in India today, the term generally refers to any single-family dwelling, regardless of its number of stories.\n\nIn Canada and the United Kingdom, a\u00a0bungalow\u00a0almost exclusively refers to one-story units. Australia tends toward the California\u00a0bungalow, a type of\u00a0bungalow\u00a0popular in the United States from about 1908 to 1940. It expanded abroad\u00a0as Hollywood became popular and increased the desirability of American-made products.\n\nThe California\u00a0bungalow\u00a0is one to one-and-a-half stories and features a large porch, sloping roof, and Spanish-inspired details.

Other types of homes may be larger and have more than one story.\n\nBungalow homes can be found throughout the U.S. They are often associated with California, but they can be found in any state.\n\nIf bungalow homes in your area seem more expensive than others, it may be due to several factors.
