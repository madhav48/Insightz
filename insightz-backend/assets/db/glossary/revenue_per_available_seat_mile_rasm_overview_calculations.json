  "definition": "Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is a unit of measurement commonly used to compare the efficiency of various airlines. It is obtained by dividing operating income byavailable seat miles(ASM). Generally, the higher the RASM, the more profitable the airline under question. Revenue is represented in cents and is not solely limited to ticket sales, as other factors of efficiency and profitability are taken into account.\n\nRevenue per available seat mile (RASM) is a term airlines use to describe and evaluate theirfinancial performance. Revenue per available seat mile (RASM) is more encompassing than total revenue because it factors in all operating revenue, in terms of capacity, rather than just passenger revenue.\n\nRevenue per available seat mile (RASM) has been adopted as a favorite standard unit of measurement by most airlines andinvestment analyststhat follow the airlines. Critics contend, however, that airlines, like most businesses, have traditionally favored the use of metrics that can cast them in the best possible light.\n\nBy explicitly including all sources of revenue, RASM includes the myriad of revenue sources air carriers have experimented with including fees or charges for baggage, seat selection, food and drink, and Wi-Fi. Airlines list their RASM\u2014also referred to as \"operating unit revenue\"\u2014in their quarterly and annualfinancial statements.\n\nThe RASM represents the total operating revenue per seat (empty or full) flown per mile. In order to calculate their RASM for a given period, an airline divides its total operating revenues by the available seat miles:\n\nRASM = Total Operating Revenues/Available Seat Miles.\n\nTotaloperating revenueis the income the airline generates from its primary business activities. This includes the money airlines make from selling tickets and money from seat upgrades, baggage fees, food and beverages, and reservation change fees.\n\nAvailable seat miles (ASM) measures the carrying capacity of an airplane that's available to generate revenue. To calculate seat miles, the airline multiplies the available seats on a plane by the number of miles that plane will fly per flight.\n\nAirlines include income derived from their normal everyday business operations in their RASM calculation and exclude one-time operating adjustments or events, such as the sale of companyassets.\n\nCost per available seat mile(CASM)\u2014also known as \"unit cost\" or \"operating expenses per ASM\"\u2014is another common metric airlines use to measure efficiency and performance. CASM is a measure of cost efficiency and represents the average cost to fly an aircraft seat (either empty or ticketed) one mile. CASM differs from RASM in a significant way. While RASM focuses on revenues earned, CASM focuses on expenses impacting an airline'sbottom line.\n\nAirlines include various operating costs in their CASM calculation, such as operating expenses, maintenance expenses, administration, andoverhead. One criticism of CASM is that some airlines exclude fuel costs in their calculation, which then calls into question the accuracy of the metric.\n\nTo calculate CASM, the airlines divide their operating costs by the available seat miles. The CASM is measured in cents. Airlines generally report thismetricon their quarterly and annual financial statements. A low CASM indicates the airline is efficient at managing its costs, which could lead to higher profit margins.\n\nThis contrasts with RASM, which measures the revenue or income the airline generates. Airlines aim for a high and growing RASM as a measurement of financial strength.\n\nRevenue per available seat mile (RASM) is an especially important metric for low-cost airlines. Many of these airlines discount the cost of their basic fares significantly in order to attract customers. Very similar to theloss leader strategycommon in retail sales, theairlines know the revenue they generatefrom these basic fares will probably not be enough to maintain profitability.\n\nInstead, the airline will need to become adept atupselling, or enticing the customer to purchase additional items, such as inflight entertainment, meals, and beverages. Because RASM includes these forms of revenue, it's an important metric in tracking an airline's financial performance.",
