  "term": "How a Histogram Works to Display Data",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA histogram graphically represents data points organized into user-specified ranges. The histogram condenses a data series into an easily interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins similar in appearance to abar graph.\n\nHistograms are commonly used instatisticsto demonstrate how many of a certain type of variable occur within a specific range. A census focused on thedemographyof a town may use a histogram to show how many people\u00a0are between the ages of zero to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30, 31 to 40, 41 to 50, 51 to 60, 61 to 70, and 71 to 80.\n\nThis histogram example would look similar to the chart below. Let's say the numerals along the vertical access represent thousands of people. You can start with the horizontal axis to read this histogram example. Beginning on the left, you'll see that there are approximately 500 people in the town who are from less than one year old to 10 years old. Four thousand people in town are 11 to 20 years old, and so on.\n\nHistograms can be customized in several ways by analysts. They can change the interval between buckets. There are eight buckets in our example with an interval of 10. This could be changed to four buckets with an interval of 20.\n\nAnother way to customize a histogram is to redefine the y-axis. The most basic label used is thefrequencyof occurrences observed in the data but one could use percentage of total or density instead.\n\nBoth histograms and bar charts provide a visual display using columns and people often use the terms interchangeably.\n\nA histogram technically represents the frequency distribution of variables in a data set, however.A bar graph typically represents a graphical comparison of discrete or categorical variables.\n\nYou can make a histogram in Microsoft Excel using the Histogram tool associated with the Statistical icon.\n\nYour other option is to do it by hand:\n\nTechnical traders may be familiar with themoving average convergence divergence (MACD)histogram. It's a populartechnical indicatorthat illustrates the difference between the MACD line and the signal line.\n\nThe MACD histogram graphically represents the difference if there's a $5 gap between the two lines. The MACD histogram is plotted on a chart to make it easy for traders to determine a specific security\u2019smomentum.\n\nA histogram bar is positive when the MACD line is above thesignal line. It's negative when the MACD line is below the signal line. An increasingMACD histogramindicates an increase in upward momentum. A decreasing histogram is used to signal downward momentum.\n\nA weakness of using only the MACD line and the signal line is the lagging nature of the signal given.\n\nThe trading signal lags the price when the MACD line crosses over the signal line. They don't cross until a price move has already occurred because the two lines aremoving averagesso traders forego a portion of an initial\u00a0move.\n\nTraders shouldn't overlook the MACD histogram when using the MACD indicator to make trading decisions. The MACD histogram helps to alleviate the signal lag problem by generating earlier entry signals.\n\nTraders can track the length of the histogram bars as they move away from the zero line. They may feel that the histogram is generating atrading signalwhen a bar is shorter in length than the preceding bar. Traders might open a position in the direction of the histogram\u2019s decline when the smaller histogram bar completes.\n\nOther technical indicators should be used in conjunction with the MACD histogram to increase the signal\u2019s reliability. Traders can place astop-loss orderto close out the trade if the security\u2019s price doesn't move as anticipated.\n\nA histogram is a graph that shows the frequency of numerical data using rectangles. The height of a rectangle is the vertical axis. It represents the distribution frequency of a variable such as the amount or how often that variable appears.\n\nThe width of the rectangle is the horizontal axis. It represents the value of the variable such as minutes, years, or ages.\n\nThe histogram displays the distribution frequency as a two-dimensional figure. The height and width of columns or rectangles have particular meanings and both can vary.\n\nA bar chart is a one-dimensional figure. The height of its bars represents something specific. The width of the bars has no meaning.\n\nThere are no gaps between columns on a histogram. Column width changes as the variable that's represented changes. The bars usually have gaps between them on bar charts.\n\nA histogram can generally be used whenever there's a need to display a comparison of the distribution of certain numerical data in various ranges of intervals. Histogram examples can help an audience quickly and easily see and understand essential meanings and patterns that are related to a large amount of data. They can be a benefit to a company's or organization's process of decision-making in various departments.\n\nA histogram is a graphical representation and organization of numerous data points. It can be organized to identify ranges that an individual or company needs. Technical analysts and traders can use the MACD histogram to detect changes in trading momentum. A histogram can also benefit a company's or organization's processes of decision-making in various departments.\n\nYou can make a histogram in Microsoft Excel using the Histogram tool if you'd like to try it out.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes online.
