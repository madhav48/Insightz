  "definition": "Daniel Rathburn is an editor at Investopedia who works on tax, accounting, regulatory, and cryptocurrency content.\n\nInput-output (I-O) analysis is a method designed to explore the complex interconnections among various sectors or industries in an economy.\n\nInput-output (I-O) analysis focuses on how economicsectorsorindustriesrely on each other for inputs (raw materials and intermediate goods) and outputs (final products).\n\nThis form of macroeconomic analysis is commonly used for estimating the impacts of positive or negative economic shocks and analyzing the ripple effects throughout aneconomy. I-O analysis was originally developed byWassily Leontief, who later won theNobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciencesfor his work in this area.\n\nThe foundation of I-O analysis involves input-output tables. Such tables include a series of rows and columns of data that quantify thesupply chainfor all sectors of an economy. Industries are listed in the headers of each row and column. The data in each column corresponds to thelevel of inputs usedin that industry\u2019s production function.\n\nFor example, the column for auto manufacturing shows the resources required for building automobiles (e.g., the amount of steel, aluminum, plastic, electronics, and so on). I-O models typically include separate tables showing the amount of labor required per dollar unit of investment or production.\n\nWhile input-output analysis is not commonly utilized byneoclassical economicsor by policy advisors in the West, it has been employed inMarxisteconomic analysis of coordinated economies that rely on acentral planner.\n\nI-O models estimate three types of impact: direct, indirect,\u00a0and induced. These terms are another way of referring to initial, secondary,\u00a0and tertiary impacts that ripple throughout the economy when a change is made to a given input level. By using I-O models,economistscan estimate the change in output across industries due to a change in inputs in one or more specific industries.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how I-O analysis works. A local government wants to build a new bridge and needs to justify the cost of the investment. To do so, it hires an economist to conduct an I-O study.\n\nThe economist talks to engineers and construction companies to estimate how much the bridge will cost, the supplies needed, and how many workers will be hired by the construction company.\n\nThe economist converts this information into dollar figures and runs numbers through an I-O model, which produces the three levels of impacts. The direct impact is simply the original numbers put into the model;\u00a0for example, the value of theraw inputs(cement, steel, etc.).\n\nThe indirect impact is the jobs created by the supplying companies\u2014in this case, cement and steel companies. These companies need to hire workers to complete the project. They either have the funds to do so or have to borrow the money to do so, which would have another impact on banks.\n\nThe induced impact is the amount of money that the new workers spend on goods and services for themselves and their families. This includes basics such as food and clothing, but now that they have moredisposable income, it also relates to goods and services for enjoyment.\n\nThe I-O analysis studies the ripple effects on various sectors of the economy caused by the local government wanting to build a new bridge. The bridge may require certain costs from the government, utilizing taxes, but the I-O analysis will show the benefits that the project generates by hiring companies that employ workers who spend in the economy, helping it to grow.\n\nInput-output analysis\u00a0is like looking at how all the pieces are used to build something and figuring out how they all fit together to make the final creation. If you want to build a bigger final product (more output), you\u2019ll need more pieces (more input).\n\nInput-output analysis is all about understanding how different parts of a bigger system, like an economy, are connected. It\u2019s about seeing how putting things in and getting things out in one place can affect other places.\n\nInput-output analysis can help estimate the economic consequences of any activity, such asstimulusspending or investments ininfrastructure. By quantifying the effects of different potential policy decisions or shocks, decision makers can be better informed and prepared for how the future might pan out.\n\nInput-output analysis can come with some drawbacks, the key one being that it assumes static relationships between different sectors or industries, which may not be the case in reality. Activities can have ripple effects and induce negative externalities, or they may change dynamics across sectors or industries. These potential fluctuations are not always captured.\n\nInput-output models can be critical for any economic stakeholder. Consider the case of a manufacturing company assessing the business landscape in the coming years. Using an input-output model, it may study the potential effects of a business expansion or downsizing on revenue, profits, and expenses. Using this analysis, it may make an informed decision about its business going forward.\n\nInput-output analysis is a type of analysis that measures ripple effects and interdependence across different sectors or industries of an economy. It\u2019s often used in the context of central economic planning. Impacts measured by input-output analysis include direct, indirect, and induced impacts.",
