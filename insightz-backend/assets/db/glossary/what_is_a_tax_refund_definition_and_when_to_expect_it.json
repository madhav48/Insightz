  "term": "What Is a Tax Refund? Definition and When to Expect It",
  "definition": "The term tax refund refers to areimbursementmade to a taxpayer for any excess amount paid in taxes to the federal or state government. While taxpayers tend to look at a refund as a bonus or a stroke of luck, it often represents what is essentially an interest-free loan that the taxpayer made to the government. It\u2019s often possible to avoid overpaying your taxes so you can keep more money in your pocket each paycheck\u2014and avoid arefund when you fileyourtax return.\n\nIt can be exciting to get a largetax refund. You can expect to get a refund if you overpaid your taxes during the year. This generally happens when taxes are deducted from your paycheck every time you get paid by your employer.\n\nHere are some reasons why a taxpayer might get a refund:\n\nTax refunds are the opposite of a tax bill, which refers to taxes owed by a taxpayer. In the case of a tax bill, you owe more taxes to the government than you paid during the year. You normally have a tax bill if your employer doesn't withhold enough taxes from your paycheck.\n\nTo avoid overpaying, you mustfill out your W-4 correctlyand update it if you experience a significant life change, such as marriage, divorce, adoption, a new freelance job or gig, the birth of a child, or a financial windfall.\n\nTaxpayers are generally better off not overpaying their taxes because that money could be put to better use. For example, you could adjust your withholding (or estimated quarterly taxes, if you\u2019re self-employed) and invest that extra money in yourindividual retirement account (IRA),401(k), or even an interest-yielding savings account. That way, the money is working for you instead of for the federal government.\n\nMost tax credits arenonrefundable, meaning that the tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer\u2019s liability to $0. Any remaining amount from a nonrefundable tax credit is automatically forfeited by the taxpayer. For this reason, this type of tax credit is sometimes called a wastable tax credit.\n\nIn contrast, a refundable tax credit pays out in full, meaning that a taxpayer is entitled to the entire amount of the credit regardless of their income or tax liability. If the tax credit reduces the tax liability to below $0, then the taxpayer gets a refund.\n\nRefundable tax credits include:\n\nThe Child Tax Credit is $2,000 maximum for eligible taxpayers. The fully refundable portion is $1,700 for 2024 and 2025.\n\nTheEarned Income Tax Credit (EITC)gives low- and moderate-income workers and families a tax break. The credit is $7,830 in 2024 and $8,046 in 2025. The amount of credit that a taxpayer receives depends on their income, filing status, and the number of children they have. For example, eligible taxpayers who have no children will receive $632 for tax year 2024 and $649 in 2025.\n\nTheAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)is a partially refundable tax credit that is available to taxpayers to offsetqualified higher education expenses (QHEEs). If a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to $0 before using the entire portion of the $2,500 tax deduction, then the remainder\u00a0may be taken as a\u00a0refundable credit\u00a0up to the lesser of 40%\u00a0of the remaining credit or $1,000.\n\nLow- and moderate-income households may qualify for thepremium tax credit (PTC), which lowers the monthly premiums for health plans offered through the federal and state health benefit exchanges. Taxpayers can use all, some, or none of their PTC in advance (i.e., upfront). If taxpayers use less PTC than they qualify for, they will get the difference as a refundable credit at tax time.\n\nTax refunds usually are issued either as checks and sent by U.S. mail or as direct deposits to the taxpayer\u2019s bank account. Alternatively, taxpayers can use a refund to buy U.S.Series I savings bondsor have it loaded on aprepaid debit card. The fastest way to get a refund is to e-file your tax return and choose direct deposit.\n\nMost refunds are issued within a few weeks of when the taxpayer files their tax return. However, there may be some instances where a refund takes longer.\n\nFor example, taxpayers who claim the EITC will receive their refunds by February 27. That's because the law requires the IRS to hold on to these refunds until March due to years of fraudulent filings for the credit.\n\nRefunds are always pleasant, but it would be better to avoid overpaying in the first place by correctly filling out your W-4 or precisely calculating your estimated taxes. The closer you get your refund to zero, the more money you will have throughout the prior year.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees. Some people consider tax refunds an alternative savings plan and look forward to the lump-sum repayment.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims that it issues \u201cmost refunds in less than 21 calendar days.\u201d If you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the additional child tax credit, then your refund will arrive no sooner than early March.\n\nYou get a refund if you overpaid your taxes the year before. This can happen if your employer withholds too much from your paychecks (based on the information you provided on your W-4). If you\u2019re self-employed, you may get a refund if you overpaid your estimated quarterly taxes. Refundable tax credits, such as the EITC, can also lead to refunds.\n\nYou can use the IRS\u2019sWhere\u2019s My Refund?tool to check the status of your most recently filed tax return within the past two tax years. You can start checking Where\u2019s My Refund? 24 hours after the IRS receives your electronically filed tax return or four weeks after you mail in a paper tax return.\n\nA tax refund is an amount of money that the government reimburses taxpayers who pay more than they owe in taxes. In general, it's a good idea to calculate the taxes that you'll owe as precisely as possible so that you don't overpay throughout the year. That way you can keep more of your money and put it to work for your best interests, whether that's earning a return and building your savings or paying off debt.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"About Form W-4, Employee's Withholding Certificate.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Withholding Estimator FAQs.\" Select \"Why does the tool\u2019s recommendation include only one or two amounts to enter on Form W-4?\u00a0(updated September 13, 2023).\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Withholding for Individuals.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Self-Employed Individuals Tax Center.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Credits for Individuals: What They Mean and How They Can Help Refunds.\"\n\nEurostat Statistics Explained. \"Glossary: Fiscal Benefits.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Rev.
