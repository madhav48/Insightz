  "term": "Month-to-Month Tenancy: Pros and Cons of Short-Term Renting",
  "definition": "A month-to-month tenancy is when a tenant rents from a landlord for one month at a time.\n\nA month-to-month tenancy is when the renter is granted possession of the property with no definite expiration date and pays the owner on a monthly basis. This tenancy is most commonly found in residential leases. In situations where there is no written agreement, tenancy is considered to be on a month-to-month basis.\n\nTenancy falls under the real estate laws that coverleases. In legal real estate terminology, a lease is a contract between the owner of a property, also known as thelandlord, and a tenant, who rents the property.The lease transfers the owner\u2019s rightsto the exclusive possession and use of the property to the tenant for an agreed-upon period.\n\nAs anyone who has rented an apartment knows, the lease sets forth the period of time for which the contract is to run and the amount of rent the tenant is contracted to pay. The renter gains access to the property and uses it in whatever manner was agreed upon in the lease. The landlord receives rent for a specified period of time, and after the lease period is up their ownership rights are returned.\n\nControl over the end date of the tenancy\n\nMoving out or replacing a tenant on short notice\n\nWhether a month-to-month tenancy is advantageous or disadvantageous depends, in part, on a renter's or landlord's desire for flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changing circumstances.\n\nMonth-to-month tenancy falls under the real estate laws that cover leases.\n\nWithin the lease contract, thetenant\u2019s legal rightto possess the property is deemed the leasehold estate\u2014or tenancy. Depending upon the contract\u2019s language, the following four different tenancies can be established.\n\nThis establishes a possession for the tenant that will last for a fixed time period, which could range from days to years. It has a specific starting and ending date, with the latter signifying the expiration of the renter\u2019s tenancy.\n\nThis is established when the renter\u2019s possession is contracted for an indefinite period, with no agreed-upon expiration date.\u00a0The tenancy is originally created for a specific period, but the renter\u2019s tenancy can continue until there is some notification of the lease\u2019s termination. Under the terms of the lease, the contract is automatically renewable until the owner or renter gives notice to terminate.\n\nAtenancy at willgives the renter the right to use the property for an unspecified period. The tenancy continues until the owner or renter gives notice of termination.In the event of either party\u2019s death, the tenancy is terminated.\n\nAtenancy at sufferanceoccurs when the renter, who at one time had established a contractual tenancy, continues to remain in the property without the owner\u2019s consent. This can occur when the renter does not surrender the property after the initial expiration date written into the lease. It usually leads to eviction proceedings being instituted by the owner. If, however, the landlord accepts a rent payment after the lease expiration date, the property is considered to be leased again, but now on a month-to-month basis.\n\nAs a tenant, you might prefer a month-to-month lease if you value flexibility above all else. With a month-to-month arrangement, you're not as restricted: you can leave the property sooner than you might be able to with a year-long lease. As a landlord, you might enjoy a month-to-month lease because it allows you to adjust the rent more often.\n\nA month-to-month lease may not be ideal for landlords because it means less income stability.\n\nMonth-to-month leases are less common than year-long leases, so if you're a tenant who's looking for a short-term rental, give yourself extra time in your search.\n\nA month-to-month tenancy differs from a year-long lease in that there is no specified end date. With a month-to-month arrangement, the tenant pays the landlord every month, and continues to live in the property for the next month. The lease can be extended or terminated every month. There are advantages and disadvantages to this type of set-up for both parties.\n\nCornell University, Legal Information Institute. \"Lease.\"\n\nCornell University, Legal Information Institute. \"Tenancy for Years.\"\n\nCornell University, Legal Information Institute. \"Periodic Tenancy.\"\n\nCornell University, Legal Information Institute. \"Tenancy at Will.\"\n\nCornell University, Legal Information Institute. \"Tenancy at Sufferance.\"",
