  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe service sector of the economy is focused on the activities that involve helping people, offering support, or performing tasks, rather than creating or selling physical items.\n\nThe service sector produces intangible goods, more precisely services instead of goods, and according to theU.S. Census Bureau, it comprises various service industries including warehousing and transportation services;\u00a0information services;securitiesand other investment services;\u00a0professional services; waste management;\u00a0health care and social assistance;\u00a0and arts, entertainment, and recreation.Countries with economies centered around the servicesectorare considered more advanced than industrial or agricultural economies.\n\nThe service sector, also known as the tertiary sector, is the third tier in the three-sector economy. Instead of product production, this sector produces services maintenance, repairs, training, or consulting.\u00a0Examples of service sector jobs include housekeeping, tours, nursing,\u00a0and teaching. By contrast, individuals employed in the industrial or manufacturing sectors producetangible goods, such as cars, clothes, or equipment.\n\nAmong the countries that place heavy emphasis on the service sector, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia,\u00a0and China rank among the top. In the United States, theInstitute for Supply Management (ISM)produces a monthly index that details the general state of business activity in the service sector. This index is regarded as a metric for the overall economic health of the country because approximately two-thirds of U.S. economic activity occurs in the service sector.\n\nThe service or tertiary sector is the third part of a three-part economy. The first economic sector, the primary sector, covers farming, mining, and agricultural business activities in the economy. The secondary sector covers manufacturing and business activities that facilitate the production of tangible goods from the raw materials produced by the primary sector. The service sector, though classified as the third economic sector, is responsible for the largest portion of the global economy\u2019s business activity.\n\nTechnology, specifically information technology systems, is shaping the way businesses in the service sector operate. Businesses in this sector are rapidly placing more focus on what is becoming known as theknowledge economy, or the ability to surpass competitors by understanding what target customers want and need, and operate in a way that meets those wants and needs quickly with minimal cost. In nearly all industries within the sector, businesses adopt new technology to bolster production,\u00a0increase speed and efficiency,\u00a0and cut down on the number of employees required for operation. This cuts down on costs and improves incoming revenue streams.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \"Snapshot of Service Industries: 2020,\" Page 2.",
