  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nRisk analysis is the process of assessing the likelihood of an adverse event occurring within the corporate, governmental, or environmental sectors.\n\nRisk analysis refers to the assessment process that identifies the potential for anyadverse eventsthat may negatively affect organizations or the environment. It's commonly performed by corporations, governments, and nonprofits. Conducting a risk analysis can help organizations determine whether they should undertake a project or approve a financial application and what actions they may want to take to protect their interests.\n\nThis type of analysis facilitates\u00a0a balance between risks and risk reduction. Risk analysts often work with forecasting professionals to minimize future negative unforeseen effects.\n\nRisk assessment enables corporations, governments, and investors to assess the probability that an adverse event might negatively impact a business, economy, project, or investment. It's essential for determining the worth of a specific project or investment and the best processes to mitigate those risks.\u00a0It provides various approaches that can be used to assess the risk and reward tradeoff of a potential investment opportunity.\n\nA risk analyst begins by identifying what could potentially go wrong. These negatives must be weighed against a probability metric that measures the likelihood of the event occurring. Risk analysis then attempts to estimate the extent of the impact if the event happens. Many identified risks such asmarket risk, credit risk, and currency risk can be reduced throughhedgingor by purchasing insurance.\n\nAlmost all large businesses require a minimum level of risk analysis. Commercial banks must properly hedge the foreign exchange exposure of overseas loans while large department stores must factor in the possibility of reduced revenues due to a global recession. Risk analysis allows professionals to identify and mitigate risks but not completely avoid them.\n\nThere are five primary methods of risk analysis and they serve varying purposes.\n\nAn analyst compares the benefits a company receives to the financial and non-financial expenses related to the benefits in a cost-benefit analysis. The potential benefits may cause other types of potential expenses to occur.\n\nA risk-benefit analysis compares potential benefits with associated potential risks. Benefits may be ranked and evaluated based on their likelihood of success or the projected impact the benefits may have.\n\nA needs risk analysis looks at the current state of a company. A company will often undergo a needs assessment to better understand a need or gap that's already known. A needs assessment may also be performed if management isn't aware of gaps or deficiencies. This analysis lets the company know where they may consider increasing spending to bring more resources in.\n\nA business may see a potential risk looming and want to determine how the situation may impact it. Consider the probability of a concrete worker strike and how it would affect areal estate developer. The developer may perform a business impact analysis to understand how each additional day of the delay may impact their operations.\n\nA root cause analysis is performed because something is happening that shouldn't be. It's the opposite of a needs analysis. It strives to identify and eliminate processes that cause issues. Other types of risk analysis often forecast what needs to be done or what could be done but a root cause analysis aims to identify the impact of things that have already occurred or continue to happen.\n\nThere are different types of risk analysis and many have overlapping steps and objectives. Each company might choose to add or change the steps below but they outline the most common process of performing a risk analysis.\n\nThe first step in many types of risk analysis is to make a list of potential risks you may encounter. These might be internal threats that arise from within a company but most risks will be external, occurring from outside forces. It's important to incorporate many members of a company for this brainstorming session because different departments may have different perspectives and inputs.\n\nA company may have already addressed its major risks through a SWOT analysis. This type of analysis may prove to be a launching point for further discussion but it often addresses a specific question. SWOT analyses are often broader.\n\nThe primary concern of risk analysis is to identify troublesome areas for a company. The riskiest aspects are often undefined areas. A critical aspect of risk analysis is therefore to understand how each potential risk has uncertainty and to quantify the range of risk that uncertainty may hold.\n\nThe goal of a risk analysis is often to better understand how risk will financially impact a company. This is usually calculated as the risk value: the probability of an event happening multiplied by the cost of the event.\n\nA company might assess that there's a 1% chance a product defection will occur. It would cost the company $100 million if the event were to occur. The risk value of the defective product would be assigned $1 million.\n\nA single defective product that could ruin brand image and customer trust may put the company out of business if the company only yielded $40 million in sales each year. The company may choose to prioritize addressing this due to the higher stakes.\n\nThe analysis model takes all available pieces of data and information and attempts to yield different outcomes, probabilities, andfinancial projectionsof what might occur. Scenario analysis or simulations can determine an average outcome value in more advanced situations. This can be used to quantify the average instance of an event occurring.\n\nIt's time to analyze the results with the model run and the data available to be reviewed. Management often takes the information and determines the best course of action by comparing the likelihood of risk, projected financial impact, and model simulations. Management may also request to see different scenarios run for varying risks based on different variables or inputs.\n\nIt's time to put a plan into action when management has digested the information. Sometimes the plan is to do nothing. A company has decided to change course in risk acceptance strategies because it makes more financial sense to simply live with the risk of something happening and deal with it after it occurs. Management may want to reduce or eliminate the risk in other cases.\n\nImplementing solutions doesn't necessarily mean risk avoidance. A company can decide to simply live with the current risks it faces. Other potential solutions might include buying insurance, divesting from a product, restricting trade in certain geographical regions, or sharing operational risk with a partner company.\n\nRisk analysis is either quantitative or qualitative.\n\nA risk model is built using simulation or deterministic statistics to assign numerical values to risk under quantitative risk analysis. The inputs are mostly assumptions andrandom variables.\n\nThe model generates a range of outputs or outcomes for any given range of input. Risk managers analyze the model's output using graphs,scenario analysis, and/orsensitivity analysisto make decisions about mitigating and dealing with the risks.\n\nAMonte Carlo simulationcan generate a range of possible outcomes of a decision or action. The simulation is a quantitative technique that repeatedly calculates results for the random input variables using a different set of input values. The resulting outcome from each input is recorded and the final result of the model is aprobability distributionof all possible outcomes.\n\nThese outcomes can be summarized on a distribution graph showing some measures of central tendency such as the mean and median and assessing the variability of the data throughstandard deviationand variance. The outcomes can also be assessed using risk management tools such as scenario analysis and sensitivity tables. A scenario analysis shows the best, middle, and worst outcome of any event.\n\nSeparating the outcomes from best to worst can provide a reasonable spread of insight for a risk manager.\n\nAn American company that operates globally might want to know how its bottom line would fare if the exchange rate of select countries strengthened. A sensitivity table shows how outcomes vary when one or more random variables or assumptions are changed.\n\nAportfolio managermight use a sensitivity table to assess how changes to the different values of each security in a portfolio will impact the portfolio's variance. Other types of risk management tools include decision trees and break-even analysis.\n\nQualitative risk analysis doesn't identify and evaluate risks with numerical and quantitative ratings. It involves a written definition of the uncertainties, an evaluation of the extent of the impact if the risk ensues, and countermeasure plans in the case of a negative event.\n\nExamples of qualitative risk tools includeSWOT analysis, cause-and-effect diagrams, decision matrixes, andgame theory. A firm that wants to measure the impact of a security breach on its servers may use a qualitative risk technique to help prepare it for any lost income that might occur from a data breach.\n\nMost investors are concerned about downside risk but the risk is the mathematical variance both to the downside and the upside.\n\nValue at risk (VaR)\u00a0is calculated by shifting historical returns from worst to best assuming that returns will be repeated, especially where risk is concerned.\n\nVaR measures and quantifies the level of financial risk within a firm,portfolio, or position over a specific time frame. Investment and commercial banks often use this metric\u00a0to determine the extent and occurrence ratio of potential losses in their institutional portfolios. Risk managers use\u00a0VaR\u00a0to measure and control the level of risk exposure. VaR calculations can be applied to specific positions or whole portfolios or they can measure firm-wide risk exposure.\n\nMay aid in minimizing losses due to management preemptively forming a risk plan\n\nMay allow management to quantify risks and assign dollars to future events\n\nMay protect company resources, produce better processes, and mitigate overall risk\n\nRelies heavily on estimates, so it may be difficult to perform for certain risks\n\nCan not predict unpredictable, black swan events\n\nMay underestimate risk magnitude or occurrence, leading to overconfident operations\n\nRisk analysis allows companies to make informed decisions and plan for contingencies before bad things occur. Not all risks may materialize but a company should understand what might occur so it can make plans ahead of time to avoid potential losses.\n\nRisk analysis also helps quantify risk because management may not know the financial impact of something that might happen. The information may help companies avoid unprofitable projects. The information may help put plans in motion that reduce the likelihood of something happening that would have caused financial stress on a company.\n\nRisk analysis can help detect early warning signs of potentially catastrophic events. It may identify that customer information isn't being adequately secured. Risk analysis can lead to better processes, stronger documentation, more robustinternal controls, and risk mitigation.\n\nRisk is a probabilistic measure. It can never tell you for sure what your precise risk exposure is at a given time but only what the distribution of possible losses is likely to be if and when they occur. There are no standard methods for calculating and analyzing risk and even VaR can have several ways of approaching the task. Risk is often assumed to occur using normal distribution probabilities which rarely occur in reality and can't account for extreme or \"black swan\" events.\n\nThefinancial crisis of2008exposed these problems as relatively benign VaR calculations that greatly understated the potential occurrence of risk events posed by portfolios ofsubprime mortgages.\n\nRisk magnitude was also underestimated and this resulted in extremeleverage ratioswithin subprime portfolios. The underestimations of occurrence and risk magnitude left institutions unable to cover billions of dollars in losses when subprime mortgage values collapsed.\n\nRisk analysis is the process of identifying and analyzing potential future events that may adversely impact a company. A company performs risk analysis to better understand what may occur, the financial implications of that event occurring, and what steps it can take to mitigate or eliminate that risk.\n\nRisk analysis is sometimes broken into three components. Risk assessment is the process of identifying what risks are present. Risk management addresses the procedures in place to minimize the damage done by risk. Risk communication is the company-wide approach to acknowledging and addressing risk. These three components work in tandem to identify, mitigate, and communicate risk.\n\nRisk analysis can be important because it guides company decision-making. It can also help safeguard company assets. Risk is present everywhere whether it's associated with proprietary data, physical goods, or the well-being of employees. Companies must be mindful of where it most likely will occur as well as where it's most likely to have strong, negative implications.\n\nRisk analysis is the process of identifying risk, understanding uncertainty, quantifying the uncertainty, running models, analyzing results, and devising a plan. It may be qualitative or quantitative and different types of risk analysis address various situations.",
