  "definition": "Form 1065: U.S. Return of Partnership Income is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax document used to declare the profits, losses, deductions, and credits of a partnership.

Individual partners report and pay taxes on their share of the business income on their personal tax returns using Schedule K-1 and then file this form with their personal tax returns,IRS Form 1040. The partnership or LLC then files a single IRS Form 1065, but the business does not pay the income tax.\n\nForeign partnerships with income in the U.S. must also file Form 1065. However, foreign partnerships earning less than $20,000 in the country or partnerships that receive less than 1% of their income in the U.S. may not have to file.\n\nNonprofit religious organizations classified as501(d)also file this form.
