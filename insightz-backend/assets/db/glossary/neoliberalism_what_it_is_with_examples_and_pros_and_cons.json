  "definition": "Liz Manning has researched, written, and edited trading, investing, and personal finance content for years, following her time working in institutional sales, commercial banking, retail investing, hedging strategies,\u00a0futures, and day trading.\n\nNeoliberalism is a policy model that encompasses both politics and economics. It favors private enterprise and seeks to transfer the control of economic factors from the government to the private sector.\n\nMany neoliberal policies concern the efficient functioning of free market capitalism and focus on limiting government spending, government regulation, and public ownership.\n\nNeoliberalism is often associated with the leadership ofMargaret Thatcher, the prime minister of the U.K. from 1979 to 1990, and Ronald Reagan, the 40th president of the U.S. from 1981 to 1989.\n\nMore recently, neoliberalism has been associated with austerity policies and attempts to cut government spending on social programs.\n\nNeoliberalism is a political and economic philosophy that emphasizes free trade, deregulation, globalization, and a reduction in government spending. It's related tolaissez-faire economics, a school of thought that prescribes minimal government interference in the economic issues of individuals and society.\n\nLaissez-faire economics is the philosophy that minimal state interference and participation in the economy will maximize economic growth and prosperity.\n\nAdditionally, neoliberalism is sometimes confused with libertarianism. However, neoliberals typically advocate for more government intervention in the economy and society than libertarianism. For example, while neoliberals usually favor progressive taxation at low rates, libertarians tend to advocate for a low flat tax or total elimination of income taxes. The two often differ philosophically as well. With libertarians focused on economic freedom and rights, and neoliberals more focused on the free market economy as the way to the goal of more growth.\n\nIn addition, neoliberals often do not oppose measures such as bailouts of major industries, which are anathema to libertarians.\n\nNeoliberalism involves the belief that greater economic freedom leads to greater economic and social progress for individuals. It supports:\n\nPresident Jimmy Carter's deregulation of the airline industry in 1978 is an example of a neoliberal policy in action. The Airline Deregulation Act removed government control over fares, routes, and who could enter the market.\n\nAt its core, liberalism is a broad political philosophy. It holds liberty to a high standard and defines all social, economic, and political aspects of society, including the role of government.\n\nNeoliberalism is essentially an economic ideology. The policies of neoliberalism are more narrowly focused and are primarily concerned with markets and the policies and measures that influence the economy.\n\nThere are many criticisms of neoliberalism. Below are the most common ones.\n\nOne common criticism of neoliberalism is that advocating for a free market approach in areas such as health and education is misguided because these services are public services. Public services are not subject to the same profit motivation as other industries.\n\nMore importantly, adopting a free market approach in health and education can lead to an increase in inequality and the underfunding of resources necessary for the long-term well-being and viability of an economy.\n\nThe adoption of neoliberal policies in the Western world has run concurrently with a rise in inequality in both wealth and income. Whileskilled workersmay be in a position to command higher wages, low-skilled workers are more likely to see stagnant wages.\n\nPolicies associated with neoliberalism are thought by some to encourage the presence ofmonopolies, which increase the profits of corporations at the expense of benefits to consumers.\n\nContrary to what proponents of neoliberalism typically claim, capital deregulation has not necessarily helped economic development. Rather, capital deregulation has led to an increase in financial instability including economic events that, at times, have sent shockwaves around the world.\n\nIn fact, anInternational Monetary Fund(IMF) report on neoliberalism reveals that an increase in capital flows has been a factor in the increased risk of adverse economic cycles.\n\nStudies suggest that neoliberal policies increase inequality. This inequality can hinder the long-term growth prospects of an economy. On one end of the spectrum, those who earn a low income have limited spending power. At the same time, those who become richer have a higher propensity to save.\n\nIn the latter scenario, wealth doesn't trickle down in the way that proponents of neoliberalism claim that it will.\n\nNeoliberalism's emphasis on economic efficiency has encouragedglobalization, which opponents say causes factories to be closed and jobs to be moved overseas.\n\nCritics of neoliberalism claim that its call to replace government-owned corporations with private ones can cause various forms of societal harm such as reducing access to essential services and harming workers' rights.\n\nIn addition, those opposed to neoliberalism claim that it is anti-democratic and can lead to exploitation and social injustice. They also claim it can lead to corporations using their power and resources to subvert the will of the majority of people. Others assert that it leads to support for undemocratic regimes that implement neoliberal economics.\n\nNeoliberalism is an economic model or philosophy that emphasizes that, in a free society, greater economic and social progress can be made when government regulation is minimized, government spending and taxes are reduced, and the government doesn't have strict control over the economy. Neoliberalism does not oppose all government intervention. However, it does wish to see it limited to only when it's necessary to support free markets and free enterprise.\n\nSome effects might include access to more products and services to meet consumer demand, greater revenue, and higher profits. Price reductions due to greater competition can also be an effect. Savings can result from a more efficient allocation of resources. The better organization of workforces and the ability to hire needed talent for specific jobs can result from neoliberal policies, as well. Others might point out some of the adverse effects believed to be associated with neoliberalism. These could include economic inequality, the growth of monopolies, a lack of job security, the loss of jobs due to outsourcing, and an increasing indifference to the needs and well-being of individuals.\n\nThe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is one example. By this agreement, Canada, Mexico, and the U.S. agreed to remove many trade restrictions between their countries to increase economic benefits to each.\n\nBroadly speaking, neoliberalism is an economic policy stance that governments should take a limited role in economies and privatize many functions. Similar to other economic policy ideas and theories, there are advantages and disadvantages to neoliberalism.\n\nThe White House. \"Ronald Reagan.\"\n\nNational Air and Space Museum. \"Airline Deregulation: When Everything Changed.\"\n\nThe Roosevelt Institute. \"The Empirical Failures of Neoliberalism,\" Page 12.\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"Neoliberalism: Oversold?\"\n\nGoudarzi, Shahrazd, et. al. \"Neoliberalism and the Ideological Construction of Equity Beliefs,\"Perspectives on Psychological Science, vol. 17, no. 5.
