  "term": "What Is a Waiver? Definition, Uses, Examples, and Types",
  "definition": "A waiver is a legally binding provision where either party in a contract agrees to voluntarily forfeit a claim without the other party being liable. Waivers are commonly seen during settlement talks, when one party may be willing to pay out a slightly higher award, as long as the other person, often a claimant, agrees to sign a waiver relinquishing their right to further legal action.\n\nA waiver is a demonstration, usually in written form, of a party\u2019s intent to relinquish a legal right or claim. The key point to note is that the relinquishment is voluntary, and can apply to a variety of legal situations.\n\nEssentially, a waiver removes areal or potential liabilityfor the other party in the agreement. For example, in a settlement between two parties, one party might, by means of a waiver, relinquish its right to pursue any further legal action once the settlement is finalized.\n\nSince the party signing the waiver is surrendering a claim that they are entitled to, it stands to reason that they will, usually, only do so if they are receiving some added benefit.\n\nWaivers can either be in written form or some form of action. A waiver carried out by an action might be based on whether a party in an agreement acts on a right, such as the right to terminate the deal in the first year of the contract. If it does not terminate the deal, which would be the act of \"absence of action,\" before the first year, that party waives its right to do so in the future.\n\nDepending on which side of the waiver you are on, the advantages and disadvantages are usually quite clear. If someone is the claimant in, say, a car accident, an insurance company would have the claimant sign a waiver as part of their settlement offer. This means that although the insurance company is paying a settlement to the claimant, the claimant can no longer pursue legal action against the insurance company.\n\nThe advantage for the claimant in this example would be that they are given a settlement package. The advantage to the insurance company is that once the claimant signs the waiver, their responsibility to the claimant, as well as the exposure to a future lawsuit, is waived.\n\nThe disadvantages in this example for the claimant are the same as the advantages for the insurance company. They would be unable to pursue a future claim. The insurance company will usually pay an inflated settlement offer, especially if they feel the claimant may have a legitimate claim in the future, and the company is attempting to mitigate that risk before it materializes. Due to the nature of waivers, they can be either advantageous or disadvantageous, depending on which side you are on and the circumstances surrounding the event.\n\nCan lower insurance requirements for certain businesses that require waivers\n\nRemoves possibility of future legal action\n\nSome waivers may be challenged in court\n\nAwaiver of subrogationis a waiver that prevents either a person or company from pursuing damage collection from a third party. Waivers of subrogation are commonly seen in construction contracts, leases, and property insurance contracts. Insurance companies will commonly add causes that prevent a party from being awarded an insurance claim settlementif they waived subrogation.\n\nAlien waiveris a waiver that forfeits a counterparty's right to place a lien on a payer's property or goods. These are common in the construction business during various stages of construction. A lien waiver is similar to a receipt and can prevent a mechanics' lien from being filed.\n\nAmedicaid waiveris a waiver that is signed by the state that can waive certain Medicaid eligibility requirements. This would result in care being offered to people who may not have otherwise been eligible for Medicaid. The waivers can be limited in certain ways and could be limited to certain medical diagnoses, or enact geographic limitations.\n\nA fee waiver is a waiver that is signed in order to reduce the fee amount, either partially or fully, of someone who is typically enduring a period of financial hardship. They can also be used to entice a buyer or servicer, when the fee might be a deterrent and mean the difference between closing the sale or losing it.\n\nA GAP waiver, which stands for Guaranteed Asset Protection waiver, is a waiver that absolves a person of the remaining payments on an asset that has been destroyed, typically a car. This means that if someone owed money on a car, and the car was damaged beyond salvaging, they are not responsible for the remaining payments. A GAP waiver could also be considered a cancellation of debt.\n\nA waiver can be a great way to finalize an agreement between two parties, ending their relationship and mitigating future risk. However, there are significant drawbacks to waivers, especially if there are legitimate legal claims that may arise in the future. Waivers can be commonplace, such as when negotiating construction contracts, and usually exist for the protection of each individual party. Whether a waiver is advantageous or even necessary depends on the unique circumstances of each event.\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. \"I-601, Application for Waiver of Grounds of Inadmissibility.\"\n\nU.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. \"State Medicaid Plans and Waivers.\"",
