  "definition": "Political economy is a branch of social sciences that studies the relationship between politics and the economy and how each influences the other.\n\nPolitical economy is a social science that focuses on the relationship between politics and the economy. It examines how politics and the economy influence each other. Political scientists study how economic theories likecapitalism,socialism, and communism work in the real world. These ideas can be studied theoretically and as they are used in the real world. Public policy created and implemented derives from these economic theories. Political economists study the underlying roots of these policies and their results.\n\nPolitical economy is a branch of social science that studies the relationship between a nation's economy, its political landscape, and public policy and how these factors influence one another. It is, therefore, the result of the interaction between politics and the economy and is the basis of the social science discipline.\n\nThose who research political economy are called political economists. Their study generally involves the examination through a sociological, political, and economic lens of how public policy, the political situation, and political institutions impact a country's economic standing and future.\n\nThe term political economy was widely used for the field we now calleconomics. Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau all used the term to describe their theories.Economy was substituted in the early 20th century with the development of more rigorous statistical methods for analyzing economic factors.\n\nAny economic theory is a means of directing the distribution of a finite amount of resources in a way that benefits the greatest number of individuals.\n\nThere are several notable types of political economies: socialism, capitalism, and communism.\n\nThe idea behind socialism is that the production and distribution of goods and wealth are maintained and regulated by society rather than a particular group of people. Whatever is produced by society is credited to those who participate, regardless of status,wealth, or position.\n\nSocialism aims to bridge the gap between rich and poor, eliminating the ability of individuals or groups to control the majority of power and wealth.\n\nThis theory advocates profit as a motive for advancement and the ability offree marketsto regulate and drive the economy on their own. The idea behind capitalism is that private individuals and entities are driven by self-interests\u2014they control production and distribution, set prices, and createsupply and demand.\n\nIndividuals often confusecommunismwith socialism, but there is a distinct difference between these two theories. Communism was a theory developed byKarl Marx, who felt that capitalism was limited and created a big divide between rich and poor. He believed in shared resources, including property. Unlike socialism, however, under communism production and distribution are overseen by the government.\n\nPolitical economy may draw upon sociology, economics, and political science to define how government, an economic system, and politics influence each other.\n\nThe roots of political economy as we know it today go back to the 18th century. Scholars during the period studied how wealth was distributed and administered between people. Some of the earlier works that examined this phenomenon include those byAdam SmithandJohn Stuart Mill.\n\nBut the term is probably best ascribed to French writer and economist, Antoine de Montchrestien. He wrote \"Trait\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie politique\" in 1615. In his book, he examined the need for production and wealth to be distributed on an entirely larger scale\u2014not in the household as Aristotle suggested. The book also analyzed how economics and politics are interrelated.\n\nScottish philosopher, economist, and writer Adam Smith is commonly referred to as the father of economics and of political economy. He wrote about the function of a self-regulating free market in his first book, which was called \"The Theory of Moral Sentiments.\"\n\nHis most famous work, \"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations\" (commonly called \"The Wealth of Nations,\" for short) helped shape classical economic theory. It was considered the foundation for the field of study by future economists.\n\nEnglishman John Stuart Mill combined economics with philosophy. He believed inutilitarianism\u2014that actions that lead to people's goodwill are right and those that lead to suffering are wrong.He essentially believed that economic theory and philosophy were needed, along with social awareness in politics, to make better decisions for the good of the people.\n\nSome of his work, including \"Principles of Political Economy, Utilitarianism,\" and \"A System of Logic\" made him one of the most important figures in politics and economics.\n\nPolitical economy studies both how the economy affects politics andhow politics affect the economy. As political parties come into and leave power, economic policy often changes in a country according to the ideology and goals of the party in power.\n\nPolitical changes can impact many areas of the economy, which can in turn impact elections and government policies. These areas include:\n\nAs the economies of more countries become interconnected throughglobalizationand international trade, the politics of one country can have a strong impact on the economy of another. Understanding the relationship between political power and economic decisions in one country can help other countries predict how their economies will be impacted.\n\nUnderstanding political economy can also help a country's economy become more resilient. If the government leaders in power at any given moment are forward-thinking, they can try to put laws and policies in place that create the greatest possibility for economic stability and growth, regardless of changing political power.\n\nPolitical economy is still a widely used term that describes any government policy that has an economic impact.\n\nPolitical economy has become an academic discipline of its own. Many major institutions offer the study as part of their political science, economics, and sociology departments.\n\nPolitical economists research to determine how public policy influences behavior,productivity, and trade. This work helps them establish how money and power are distributed between people and different groups. They may study specific fields such as law, bureaucratic politics, legislative behavior, the intersection of government and business, and regulation.\n\nThe study may be approached in any of three ways:\n\nModern applications of political economy involve the study of later philosophers and economists, such as Karl Marx.\n\nAs mentioned above, Marx became disenchanted with capitalism as a whole. He believed that individuals suffered under regimented social classes, where one or more individuals controlled the greater proportion of wealth.\n\nUnder communist theories, this would be eradicated, allowing everyone to live equally while the economy functions based on the ability and needs of each participant. Under communist regimes, resources are controlled and distributed by the government.\n\nMany people confuse socialism and communism. It's true there are some similarities\u2014notably, that both stress bridging the gap between rich and poor, and that society should relegate equilibrium among all citizens.\n\nBut there are inherent differences between the two. While resources in a communist society are owned and controlled by the government, individuals in a socialist society hold property. People can still purchase goods and services under socialism, while those who live in a communist society are provided with their basic necessities by the government.\n\nFascism can be viewed as a form of political economy because it blends political and economic principles. It is defined as a form of government that is controlled by one individual or a small group of people. Fascism extols nationalism and the rights of the nation over those of individuals. The government controls investments and industries and promotes social classes and policies that are favorable to corporations, including privatization.\n\nThe main concerns of political economy are the relationship between governments and individuals, and how public policy affects society. These are determined through the study of sociology, politics, and economics.\n\nSome of the characteristics or themes of a political economy include the distribution of wealth, how goods and services are produced, who owns property and other resources, who profits from production, supply and demand, and how public policy and government interaction impact society.\n\nAdam Smith is generally considered the father of economics and of political economy. But the term is generally ascribed to French economist Antoine de Montchrestien, who wrote the book \"Trait\u00e9 de l'\u00e9conomie politique,\" which translates to the treaty of the political economy.\n\nPolitical economy is a branch of the social sciences that examines how politics and the economy impact one another. A country's economic policy often changes when political parties change. This can impact things like monetary and fiscal policy, food security, labor crises, rising inequality, GDP, and disaster management. These changes can prompt new laws, policies, or election outcomes.\n\nThe rise of globalism and international trade means that the politics of one country can have a strong impact on the economy of another. Understanding political economy can help countries become more resilient in the face of global economic changes.\n\nOxford Bibliographies. \"Political Economy.\"\n\nPaganelli, Maria Pia. \"Adam Smith and the Origins of Political Economy,\"Social Philosophy and Policy, vol. 37, no. 1, 2020, pp. 159\u2013169.\n\nInternational Relations and Security Network. \"A Discourse on Political Economy.\"\n\nJohn Mill. \"Principles of Political Economy.\" Longmans, Green, and Company, 1848.\n\nShleifer, Andrei, and Robert W.
