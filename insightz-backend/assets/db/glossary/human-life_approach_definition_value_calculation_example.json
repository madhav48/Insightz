  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAndy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nThe human-life approach is a method of calculating the amount oflife insurancea family would need based on the financial loss they would incur if the insured person in the family were to pass away today.\n\nThe human-life approach is usually calculated by taking into account a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the insured individual's age, gender, planned retirement age, occupation, annual wage, employment benefits, as well as the personal and financial information of the spouse and/or dependent children.\n\nSince the value of a human life has economic value only in its relation to other lives, such as a spouse or dependent children, this method is typically only used for families with working family members. The human-life approach contrasts with theneeds approach.\n\nWhen using the human-life approach, it's necessary\u00a0to replace all of the income that's lost when an employed family member dies. This figure\u00a0includes\u00a0after-tax pay\u00a0and makes adjustments for expenses (like a second car) incurred while earning that income. It also considers the value ofhealth insuranceor other employee benefits.\n\nWhen determining the life insurance amount needed for a family, there are many important factors to consider. It is imperative to spend the appropriate time assessing the many variables involved so that a family can ensure that it will be taken care of and will not be in any sort of financial distress if a family member passes away. The following are five key steps in calculating life insurance needs for the human-life approach.\n\nStep One:Estimate the insured\u2019s remaining lifetime earnings, taking\u00a0into consideration both the \u201caverage\u201d annual salary and potential future increases, which will have a significant impact on life insurance requirements.\n\nStep Two:Subtract a reasonable estimate of annualincome taxesand living expenses spent on the insured. This provides\u00a0the\u00a0actual salary needed to provide for family needs, minus the presence of the insured. As a rule of thumb, this figure should be close to\u00a0about 70%\u00a0of the pre-death income, although this number may vary\u00a0from family to family, depending on\u00a0individual budgets.\n\nStep Three:Determine the length of time for which earnings will need to be replaced. This time period could be\u00a0until the\u00a0insured\u2019s dependents are fully\u00a0grown, and no longer require\u00a0financial support, or until the insured's assumed\u00a0retirement age.\n\nStep Four:Select adiscount ratefor\u00a0future earnings. A conservative figure for this estimate would be\u00a0the assumed rate of return on\u00a0U.S.Treasury billsornotes. This is needed because a\u00a0life insurance company will leave a death benefit in an interest-bearing account.\n\nStep Five:Multiply\u00a0the net salary needed by the length of time needed to determine the future earnings.\u00a0Then, using the assumed rate of return, figure out thepresent valueof future earnings.\n\nConsider a 40-year-old that makes $65,000 per year. After following the above steps, it is determined that the family needs\u00a0$48,500 per year to support itself if the 40-year old individual passes away, and must do\u00a0so until what the retirement age of the individual would have been. In this case, 25 years away till 65. Assuming\u00a0a 5%\u00a0discount rate, the present value of this 40-year-old's\u00a0future net salary over 25 years would be $683,556.",
