  "definition": "Learn about company liquidity, operational efficiency, and short-term health\n\nWorking capital is the difference between a company\u2019s current assets and its short-term liabilities.\n\nWorking capital, also known as net working capital (NWC), is the amount of money a company has available to operate after deducting its current liabilities from its current assets. Current assets are items like cash, accounts receivable/customers\u2019 unpaid bills, and inventories of raw materials and finished goods. Current liabilities are items such as accounts payable and debts.\n\nWorking capital is a commonly used measurement to gauge the short-term financial health and efficiency of an organization.\n\nWorking capital is calculated using the assets and liabilities listed on a corporation's balance sheet, with a focus on immediate debts and assets that can be converted to cash within a short period. Calculating working capital provides insight into a company's short-term liquidity. A company with positive working capital generally has the potential to invest in growth and expansion. But if current assets are exceeded bycurrent liabilities, the company has negative working capital and may face difficulties in growth, paying back creditors, or even avoiding bankruptcy.\n\nIn corporate finance, \"current\" refers to a period of one year or less. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within 12 months, while current liabilities are obligations that must be paid within the same timeframe.\n\nThe amount of working capital needed varies by industry, company size, and risk profile. Industries with longer production cycles require higher working capital due to slower inventory turnover. Alternatively, bigger retail companies interacting with numerous customers daily can generate short-term funds quickly and often need lower working capital.\n\nTo calculate working capital, you subtract a company's current liabilities from its current assets. Both figures can be found in public companies' publicly disclosed financial statements. This information may not be readily available for private companies.\n\nWorking Capital = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities\n\nWorking capital is expressed as a dollar figure. For example, if a company has $100,000 in current assets and $30,000 in current liabilities, it has $70,000 of working capital. This means the company has $70,000 at its disposal in the short term if it needs money for any reason.\n\nA business can either have positive or negative working capital:\n\nIt's worth noting that while negative working capital isn't always bad and can depend on the specific business and its lifecycle stage, prolonged negative working capital can be problematic.\n\nWorking capital consists of current assets and current liabilities. A company'sbalance sheetcontains all working capital components, although it may not need all the elements discussed below. For example, a service company that doesn't carry inventory will simply not factor inventory into its working capital calculation.\n\nCurrent assets are economic benefits that the company expects to receive within the next 12 months. Calculating working capital poses the hypothetical situation of liquidating all items below into cash.\n\nCurrent liabilities encompass all debts a company owes or will owe within the next 12 months.\u00a0The overarching goal of working capital is to understand whether a company can cover all of these debts with the short-term assets it already has on hand.\n\nTheresa Chiechi \u00c2\u00a9 Investopedia, 2019\n\nWorking capital can be very insightful in determining a company's short-term health. However, there are some limitations that can make the metric misleading. Here are four limitations of working capital:\n\nMost major new projects, like expanding production or entering into new markets, often require an upfront investment, reducing immediate cash flow. Therefore, companies needing extra capital or using working capital inefficiently can boost cash flow by negotiating better terms with suppliers and customers.\n\nCompanies can forecast future working capital by predicting sales, manufacturing, and operations.Forecastinghelps estimate how these elements will impact current assets and liabilities.\n\nOn the other hand, a high working capital amount isn't always a good thing. It might indicate that the business has too much inventory or isn't using excess cash as well as it could. Alternatively, it could mean a company fails to leverage the benefits of low-interest or no-interest loans.\n\nAnother financial metric, the current ratio, measures the ratio of current assets to current liabilities. Unlike working capital, it uses different accounts in its calculation and reports the relationship as a percentage rather than a dollar amount.\n\nIn March 2024, Microsoft (MSFT) reported $147 billion of total current assets, which included cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets.\n\nThe company also reported $118.5 billion of current liabilities, which comprise accounts payable, current portions of long-term debts, accrued compensation, short-term income taxes,short-term unearned revenue, and other current liabilities.\n\nTherefore, in March 2024, Microsoft had about $28.5 billion in working capital. If Microsoft were to liquidate all short-term assets and extinguish all short-term debts, it would have nearly $30 billion in remaining cash.\n\nWorking capital is the amount of liquid assets a company has available, after accounting for its upcoming payments. It tells you how much money the company has available to pay employees, suppliers, and other day-to-day business needs.\n\nWorking capital is calculated from the current assets (assets the company can sell or spend easily within one year) minus any upcoming debt payments due over the next year.\n\nWorking capital is calculated by taking a company\u2019s current assets and deducting current liabilities. For instance, if a company has current assets of $100,000 and current liabilities of $80,000, then its working capital would be $20,000. Common examples of current assets include cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. Examples of current liabilities include accounts payable, short-term debt payments, or the current portion of deferred revenue.\n\nWorking capital is crucial for businesses to remain solvent. Even a profitable business can face bankruptcy if it lacks the cash to pay its bills. For example, if a company has $1 million in cash from retained earnings and invests it all at once, it might not have enough current assets to cover its current liabilities.\n\nGenerally, yes, if a company's current liabilities exceed its current assets. This indicates the company lacks the short-term resources to pay its debts and must find ways to meet its short-term obligations. However, a short period of negative working capital may not be an issue depending on the company's stage in itsbusiness life cycleand its ability to generate cash quickly.\n\nA company can improve its working capital by increasing current assets and reducing short-term debts. To boost current assets, it can save cash, build inventory reserves, prepay expenses for discounts, and carefully extend credit to minimize bad debts. To reduce short-term debt, a company can avoid unnecessary borrowing, secure favorable credit terms, and manage its spending efficiently.\n\nWorking capital is critical when gauging a company's short-term health, liquidity, and operational efficiency. You calculate working capital by subtracting current liabilities from current assets, providing insight into a company's ability to meet its short-term obligations and fund ongoing operations.\n\nPositive working capital generally means a company has enough resources to pay its short-term debts and invest in growth and expansion. Conversely, negative working capital indicates potential cash flow problems, which might require creative financial solutions to meet obligations.\n\nWorking capital is a useful measure to track. Still, it's important to look at the types of assets and liabilities and the company's industry and business stage to get a more complete picture of its finances.\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Current Asset.\"\n\nMicrosoft. \"Earnings Release FY 24 Q3.\"",
