He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nA naked put is an options strategy in which the investor writes, or sells,put optionswithout holding a short position in theunderlying security.\u00a0A naked put strategy is sometimes referred to as an \"uncovered put\" or a \"short put\" and the seller of an uncovered put is known as a naked writer.\n\nThe primary use of this strategy is to capture the option'spremiumon an underlying security forecast as going higher, but one which the trader or investor would not be disappointed to own for at least a month or maybe longer.\n\nA naked put option strategy assumes that the underlying security will fluctuate in value, but generally rise over the next month or so. Based on this assumption, a trader executes the strategy by selling a put option with no correspondingshort positionin their account. This sold option is said to be uncovered because the initiator has no position with which to fill the terms of the option contract, should a buyer wish toexercisetheir right to the option.\n\nSince a put option is designed to create profit for atraderwho correctly forecasts that the price of the security will fall, the naked put strategy is of no consequence if the price of the security actually goes up. Under this scenario, the value of the put option goes to zero and the seller of the option gets to keep the money they received when they sold the option.\n\nA seller of put options wants the underlying security to rise, so that they end up profiting. But if the price of the underlying security falls, they may end up having to buy the stock because the option buyer might decide to exercise their right to sell someone the security.Traders who like this strategy prefer only to do this on underlying securities that they view favorably. If they get the stock put to them, and it is a stock they like and see prospects for, they will not mind buying the stock and holding it for a least a month.\n\nA naked put option strategy stands in contrast to a covered put strategy. In a covered\u00a0put, the investor keeps a short position in the underlying security for the put option. The underlying security and the puts are respectively shorted and sold in equal quantities.\n\nWhen executed in this manner, a covered put works in virtually the same way as acovered callstrategy, with the primary difference being that the individual executing the covered put strategy expects to profit from the mildly declining price of a security, while a covered call trader expects to profit from a mildly rising price. That is because the underlying position for covered puts is a short instead of along position, and the option sold is a put rather than a call.\n\nA naked put strategy is inherently risky\u00a0because of the limitedupsideprofit potential and, theoretically,\u00a0a significant downside loss potential.\u00a0The maximum profit\u00a0is only achievable if the underlying price closes merely at or above thestrike priceat expiration. Further increases in the cost of the underlying security will not result in any additional profit.\n\nThe maximum loss, meanwhile, is theoretically significant because the price of the underlying security can fall to zero. The higher the strike price, the higher the loss potential.\n\nHowever, in more practical terms, the seller of the options will likely repurchase them well before the price of the underlying security falls too far below the strike price, based on their risk tolerance andstop-losssettings.\n\nBecause of the risk involved, only experienced options investors should write naked puts. Themarginrequirements are often quite high for this strategy as well, due to the propensity for substantial losses.\n\nInvestors who firmly believe the price of\u00a0the underlying security, usually a stock, will rise or stay the same may write put options to earn the premium. If the stock persists above the strike price between the time\u00a0of writing the options and theirexpiration date, then the options writer keeps the entire premium, minus commissions.\n\nWhen the price of the stock falls below the strike price before or\u00a0by the expiration date, the buyer of the options vehicle can demand the seller take delivery of shares of the underlying stock. The options seller will then have to go to theopen marketand sell those shares at\u00a0the market price\u00a0loss, even though the options writer had to pay the options strike price.\u00a0For example, imagine the strike price is $60, and the open market price for the stock is $55 at the time the options contract is exercised. In this case, the options seller will incur a loss of $5 per share of stock.\n\nThe premium collected does\u00a0somewhat offset the loss on the stock, but the potential for\u00a0loss can still be substantial. Thebreakeven pointfor a naked put option is the strike price minus the premium, giving the options seller a little leeway.\n\nOptions Industry Council. \"Naked Put (Uncovered Put, Short Put).\"",
