  "term": "Commerce: What It Is, and How It Differs From Business and Trade",
  "definition": "Commerce involves buying and selling things of value (goods and services) between two or more entities (businesses, consumers, or governments).\n\nCommerce is a form of trade between two or more parties that is meant to be satisfactory to all. It is the subset of business that focuses on the sale of finished or unfinished products rather than their manufacturing, marketing, sourcing, or transportation.\n\nGenerally, commerce can refer to an exchange of goods or services for money or something of equal value.\n\nFrom the broadest perspective, governments are tasked with managing the commerce of their nations in a way that meets the needs of their citizens by providing jobs and producing beneficial goods and services.\n\nCommerce has existed from the moment humans started exchanging goods and services with one another. From the early days ofbarteringto the creation of currencies and the establishment oftraderoutes, humans have sought ways to facilitate the exchange of goods and services by building a distribution process to bring together sellers and buyers.\n\nToday, the term \u201ccommerce\u201d normally refers to large-scale purchases and sales. The sale or purchase of a single item by a consumer is defined as atransaction, while commerce may refer to all transactions related to the purchase and sale of that item.\n\nMost commerce in modern times is conducted internationally and represents the buying and selling of goods between nations.\n\nCommerce is not synonymous with business but is a subset of it. Commerce does not relate to the manufacturing, production, or sourcing processes but only to the distribution of goods and services. That alone encompasses a number of roles, such as economic, legal, logistical, political, regulatory, and social.\n\nThese words are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same.\n\nCommerce refers specifically to the exchange of products or services between two or more parties. For example, you engage in commerce when you pay to fill up your gas tank.\n\nAlong the way, there were other examples of commercial activity. For example, the crude oil was sold in bulk to one or more oil companies. That was a commercial transaction as well.\n\nBusinessis any endeavor undertaken for the purpose of making a profit.\n\nIt includes selling goods and services, but everyone else involved in the process of creating the product and getting it to a consumer is engaged in business activity.\n\nIn the above example, when you filled up your gas tank at a service station, you completed a process that started with an oil exploration company locating an oil deposit, continued with a drilling company extracting crude oil, and then went through many stages of transportation, refining, and distribution before it got to your gas tank. A number of people conducted business to get it there.\n\nThe distinction between commerce and trade is pretty fine. Both are the direct exchange of goods and services for something of value between two or more parties. (In modern times, \u201csomething of value\u201d means money.)\n\nHowever, there are some differences in their usage:\n\nWhen properly managed, commercial activity enhances the standard of living of a nation\u2019s citizens and increases its standing in the world. However, when commerce is allowed to run unregulated, large businesses can become too powerful and impose negativeexternalitieson citizens for the benefit of the business owners.\n\nMost nations have established government agencies responsible for promoting and managing commerce, such as theDepartment of Commercein the United States.\n\nLarge multinational organizations regulate commerce across borders. For example, theWorld Trade Organization (WTO)and its predecessor, theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), established rules for tariffs relating to the import and export of goods between countries. The rules are meant to facilitate commerce and establish a level playing field for member countries.\n\nThe idea of commerce has expanded to include electronic commerce in the 21st century. Electronic commerce, orecommerce, is defined as any business or commercial transaction that includes the transfer of financial information over the internet.\n\nEcommerce changed how commerce is conducted. In the past,imports and exportsposed logistical hurdles for both the buyer and the seller. Only larger companies with scale in their favor could benefit from export customers.\n\nWith the rise of ecommerce,small businessowners have a chance to market to international customers and fulfill their orders.\n\nExport management companies help domestic small businesses with thelogisticsof selling internationally. Export trading companies help small businesses by identifying international buyers and domestic sourcing companies that can fulfill the demand. Import/export merchants purchase goods directly from a domestic or foreign manufacturer, and then they package the goods and resell them on their own as an individual entity, assuming theriskbut taking higherprofits.\n\nThe term \u201ccommerce\u201d is not interchangeable with business, but is rather a subset of business. Business includes manufacturing, marketing, production, and sourcing, whereas commerce pertains to the distribution side of the business, specifically the distribution of goods and services.\n\nThere are three distinct types of ecommerce:\n\nEcommerce is any sale of goods and services that isfinalized in a transaction on the internet.\n\nEcommerce is an alternative to transactions that take place in brick-and-mortar stores. Today, many companies offer their customers the choice of online or in-store purchasing.\n\nCommerce refers to transactions between two or more parties, in which goods or services are exchanged. This can take place on a small scale, such as when two individuals exchange items or money, or on a large scale, such as the buying and selling of goods between nations. In recent decades, ecommerce has emerged as another form of commerce, in which transactions take place on the internet rather than in brick-and-mortar stores.",
