Consult with a qualified professional before making any financial decisions. This article is not a recommendation by Investopedia or the writer to invest in cryptocurrencies nor can the accuracy or timeliness of the information be guaranteed.\n\nSign up and trade $100 on Kraken and get $25 USDG.

Investors who value low cost but need access to high-quality amenities and resources won\u2019t find a better exchange that consistently offers both. With a minimum deposit of just $10, Prospective clients can set up an account and start trading their favorite cryptocurrency.\n\nLow fees for beginning and advanced cryptocurrency traders\n\nA good selection of educational resources and research amenities\n\nAccess to web, desktop, mobile, and Kraken Pro platform\n\nKraken is not available in all 50 U.S. states\n\nDoes not offer FDIC or SIPC insurance or other criminal insurance.\n\nDoes not allow options trading for cryptocurrency\n\nKraken was founded in 2011. While the company has gone fully remote, its head office is in San Francisco, CA.Aside from its digital presence,Krakenoperates worldwide in over 190 countries, services over 10 million clients, and has established itself as one of the premier cryptocurrency exchanges that offer the best low-fee service.\n\nDepending on the user's 30-day trading volume, Kraken clients pay maker fees between 0.00% and 0.25% and taker fees between 0.10% and 0.40%. Other fees, such as deposit and address setup fees, come at no extra cost.In addition to its low-fee structure, Kraken offers a unique service that caters to multiple types of clients at various skill levels.\n\nFor instance, Kraken\u2019s regular platform enables beginning and low-volume traders to start trading and storing their cryptocurrency with a $10 minimum deposit, access to over 300 cryptocurrencies, an excellent selection of educational and news content, and the ability to create and utilize Kraken's exclusive wallet.Advanced traders who need more sophisticated features should consider Kraken Pro. This platform is designed for traders who need access to advanced order types, charting, and screening capabilities not offered on the original platform.\n\nThe Kraken Pro's best feature is that it\u2019s free to use and adheres to the same fee structure as the basic platform, so advanced traders don\u2019t have to worry about extra costs. However, Kraken comes with potential drawbacks. While Kraken operates in many countries, the exchange is not available in all 50 U.S. states, such as Washington, New York, and Maine. Furthermore, in many other states, additional restrictions apply to activities such as staking, payment services, funding, and custody. Prospective clients interested in a specific service should check if it is legal in their respective state.It\u2019s also important to note that Kraken does not offer any insurance for its users.\n\nGemini is our top choice for security due to its sound security standards, commitment to compliance, and third-party audits that ensure its security infrastructure operates at a high level. It\u2019s also one of the few crypto exchanges to offer FDIC and crypto insurance to help further safeguard traders\u2019 accounts.\n\nIn addition to being our choice for security, Gemini is also our top choice for experienced traders due to Gemini\u2019s ActiveTrader software. The platform offers experienced users the ability to conduct advanced charting techniques, use advancedorder types, and trade futures and perpetual contracts.\n\nHighly secure and compliant platform\n\nAvailable in all 50 U.S. states\n\nPass-through FDIC insurance for uninvested cash and crypto insurance\n\nOffers a low number of cryptocurrencies\n\nCustomer support only has a request form\n\nGemini was founded in 2014 and is currently headquartered in New York, N.Y.Due to its high-security standards, Gemini is our choice for users who value security for their cryptocurrency holdings. By default, users\u2019 accounts are equipped with two-factor authentication. However, Gemini also supports external hardware security keys such as Yubikey to secure accounts further.\n\nGemini holds most customer assets in offshore cold storage, and it works to facilitate easy transfers of assets between the exchange and consumer wallets. Gemini also subjects itself to routine third-party audits and claims to have completed SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type 2 exams, in addition to earning its ISO 27001 certification.Users also have the option to store their cryptocurrency in either Gemini\u2019s hot wallet, which is insured, or its cold wallet.\n\nGemini is also our choice for experienced crypto traders. While high-net-worth individuals can enjoy its high-security standards, they can also appreciate the advanced software it offers with its trademarked tool, ActiveTrader. Even though it offers less than 80 cryptocurrencies, a low amount for a major crypto exchange, Gemini\u2019s ActiveTrader deserves recognition as a highly advanced platform capable of reaching trade execution speeds of 65 microseconds. Experienced traders also have access to high-risk assets such as perpetual contracts, crypto futures, and indices.ActiveTrader also provides advanced charting and order types that further assist traders in their cryptocurrency ventures.\n\nGemini does have some drawbacks. Its fee structure, at first glance, appears reasonable. Depending on your 30-day trade volume, maker fees can range from 0.00% to 0.20%, while taker fees can range from 0.03% to 0.40%. However, the order type you use to execute a trade can trigger more fees, in addition to a 2.50% fiat transfer fee for using PayPal and a $25 wire transfer fee for withdrawals.Customer support should also be noted, as traders must submit a form to deal with issues like account management and fraud.\n\nCoinbase is best for beginners due to its sleek user interface, solid security infrastructure, and a reasonable fee structure that is easy to understand. While Coinbase offers an excellent service for investors new to crypto trading, the company also provides more advanced features, which are nonetheless vital for beginning crypto traders. With Coinbase's comprehensive educational resources, beginners can enhance their skills and utilize Coinbase\u2019s moreadvanced trading toolswhen they are ready without having to jump to another exchange that caters to more experienced traders.\n\nExcellent educational and research resources\n\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\n\nAvailable in 172 countries and offers access to web, desktop, and mobile platforms\n\nIt may not be a good fit for established traders\n\nDoes not offer margin or option trading and only provides future trading on select crypto\n\nMust chat or request a call when contacting customer service\n\nCoinbase is headquartered in San Francisco and was founded in 2012, which is coincidentally the yearBitcoin gained serious traction.Since its inception as a cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase has become one of the premier leaders in the cryptocurrency space and has done the one thing many crypto exchanges fail to do: cater to beginner crypto investors.\n\nCryptocurrency is a complicated alternative investment that requires careful study by traders. However, Coinbase\u2019s educational resources, which cover basic and advanced trading topics, can help clarify its complexity.In addition, Coinbase offers two charting versions: a basic and an advanced version.\n\nThe basic version is a simple chart with essential data such as market cap, volume, and other metrics that beginning traders will find valuable. However, it does not provide any charting tools, which is why Coinbase also has an advanced version.The advanced version offers charting features such as Fibonacci, drawing tools, and projections. Even with advanced trading software, Coinbase may not be a great fit even for experienced traders, as the exchange lacks options and margin trading and only offers futures trading on specific coins.\n\nInvestors who open an account with Coinbase will see it has a reasonable fee structure. Its maker fee ranges between 0.00% to 0.40%, and its taker fees are 0.05% to 0.60%. Also, users can trade more than 240 cryptocurrencies while being able to survey over 18,000 digital assets.While Coinbase provides web, desktop, and mobile platforms, its customer service could be better.Users can contact a service rep through chat or request a call for further assistance.\n\nOn May 11, 2025, Coinbase received an email communication from a threat actor notifying the company that internal data and customer information, including names, contact details, partial SSNs, and transaction history, had been accessed after allegedly bribing non-U.S. contractors. The attacker demanded payment to keep the data private. Coinbase says no passwords or funds were compromised and has not paid the ransom.\n\nCrypto.com is our choice for the best mobile app provider due to its major focus on its mobile platform and all that that entails. Crypto traders can buy, sell, use, and trade crypto from the palms of their hands.\n\nCrypto.com is also our choice for Bitcoin traders and investors due to its reasonable fee structure and excellent security infrastructure, which is important to many Bitcoin investors and users. Crypto.com provides Bitcoin options and futures for Bitcoin derivative traders.\n\nAllows Bitcoin options and futures\n\nReasonable fee structure and a good selection of cryptocurrency\n\nExcellent mobile platform and debit card program\n\nAvailable in fewer than 100 countries\n\nOnly offers chat service for assistance\n\nCrypto.com only provides access to a hot wallet\n\nCrypto.com, headquartered in the Central Region of Singapore, boasts an impressive customer base of over 100 million users in more than 90 countries, which isn\u2019t bad for a company that was founded in 2016.The main reason why Crypto.com is so popular goes far beyond its marketing campaigns. It's one of the best crypto exchanges for mobile-first traders and Bitcoin holders.\n\nMobile users considering crypto.com can expect a sleek and fully intuitive mobile platform that offers more than convenience. Mobile users have access to more than 400 cryptocurrencies. Depending on eligible cryptocurrency, users can earn rewards through Crypto.com\u2019s Earn program and its Staking program.In addition to buying, selling, and using cryptocurrency as well as trading derivatives, Crypto.com also provides its mobile users with sophisticated trading features, allowing them to automate their trades. Furthermore, Crypto.com includes access to its Visa debit card, a cryptocurrency-connected card enabling users to easily use their crypto to buy goods and services on the private market.\n\nAlong with its mobile capabilities, Crypto.com is also best for Bitcoin. The platform offers a wide array of trading, from derivatives to regular long-term investments. The company has a reasonable fee structure, which also applies to its mobile platform. However, depending on their 30-day trade volume, users can expect maker fees to be between 0% and 0.25% and taker fees to be between 0.05% and 0.5%. There are additional benefits for VIP users who hold crypto.com\u2019s cryptocurrencyCronos (CRO).One benefit is that it offers better rewards with its debit card. For instance, the higher the CRO count, the better the rewards. Bitcoin traders will also have access to Bitcoin options and futures, which is an important feature for traders and investors alike.\n\nBefore users sign up for an account, they should consider the downsides. For instance, Crypto.com is not readily available in many countries. Before committing to opening an account, you should check to see if Crypto.com legally operates in your geographical location. While Crypto.com has an excellent support center to help users resolve issues on their own, it only provides access to a live chat feature for further assistance.\n\nBitmart, which offers over 1,700 cryptocurrencies, is our top choice as the best crypto exchange foraltcoins. While the exchange lacks fundamental trading features, it's an excellent place to buy cryptocurrency that traders would normally have to access on other exchanges.\n\nAccess to over 1,700 cryptocurrencies\n\nAllows social trading through its copy-trading feature\n\nBitMart Academy provides excellent educational resources\n\nDoes not display its security infrastructure\n\nA complex tiered fee structure that ranges to the high side\n\nOnly supports crypto deposits to fund account\n\nBitMart, founded in 2017 and headquartered in New York, N.Y., is our top choice for altcoins due to its accessibility to over 1,700 tradable cryptocurrencies.While still offering access to the most important coins on the market, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, it provides other coins that may be difficult to find on some other exchanges. It's important to note that cryptocurrency poses significant risks even with established digital coins. Smaller, less established coins pose even more risks, with liquidity and market manipulation being a serious concern for crypto holders.\n\nBitMart also offers its users an interesting way to trade cryptocurrency: copy trading. BitMart users can access some statistics for its top traders and see such metrics as theirreturns on investment (ROI)for cryptos they traded, along with their trading history and current trade positions. However, traders should bear in mind that past success does not lead automatically to future gains, and they should proceed cautiously.While BitMart has advanced charting capabilities, it\u2019s only for futures trading.In addition, BitMart does not offer some of the order types that certain competitors offer. To date, BitMart only provides two order types: market and limit orders.\n\nThrough BitMart Academy, the exchange offers excellent educational resources that cover various topics, from basic knowledge to more complex subjects. While it offers a robust selection of crypto, there are some drawbacks. Its fee structure is complex, to say the least. For instance, the classification you fall into and your 30-day trading volume determine the fees associated with the crypto you buy and sell. Prospective clients should study Bitmart\u2019s fee chart and understand it before opening an account. Nonetheless, most of Bitmart\u2019s maker fees are between 0.04% to 0.6%. Most of its taker fees are between 0.045% to 0.6%.In addition, the only way to fund a new account is to transfer crypto from a wallet or another exchange.\n\nBitMart claims to have an advanced risk control system with multi-signature technologies and a hybrid hot and cold wallet storage.Unlike some competitors, BitMart does not reveal its security infrastructure for users' accounts. For instance, it does not publicly state its security certifications or disclose whether it subjects itself to third-party audits. We can confirm that the company equips users with multifactor authentication.\n\nInvestopedia launched in 1999, and since 2020, we have independently researched 14 cryptocurrency exchanges currently operating in the industry.
