As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nA Japan ETF is anexchange-traded fund(ETF) that invests the majority of its assets in Japanese\u00a0assets that trade on local stock exchanges. These ETFs are diversified investments that have a low initial investment requirement and management costs.\n\nJust like company stock, Japan ETFs trade on stock exchanges. They provide investors access to the Japanese economy through currency, equity, andfixed-incomemarkets. Investors can choose from more than a dozen options that trade on U.S. stock exchanges.\n\nInvesting in foreignstock marketswas something only sophisticatedtraderscould ever hope to achieve in the past. But average investors have been able to get into the market, giving them the chance to profit from the global shifts in capital. This movement of money has a lot to do with the advance of exchange-traded funds.\n\nETFs poolassetsfrom investors who have similar goals. They are listed on exchanges and trade throughout the day just like ordinary stocks. They strive to replicate the performance of a broad equity market, specificsector, or trend by mirroring the holdings of a designated index. This is a hypothetical\u00a0portfolio\u00a0ofsecuritiesrepresenting a particular market or a segment of it.\n\nJapan ETFs provide international investors with an easy way to gain exposure to the country without buying individual stocks and placing all their eggs in one basket.\u00a0These vehicles aremanaged passivelyaround a broad underlying index, such as the MSCI Japan Index,\u00a0whose constituents cover approximately 85% of thefree float-adjustedmarket capitalizationin the country.\n\nInvestors can choose from 20 Japan ETFs that trade on U.S. stock exchanges as of Jnuary 2024. Together, they hold combined assets of about $31 billion.These ETFs track eight majorindiceson Japan's stock market. This is in addition to those that track small- and mid-cap investment strategies and currencies.\n\nJapan is an advanced economy with a largeequity market. That means there are plenty of ETFs to choose from, including more exotic ones that focus exclusively on the country\u2019s smaller, up-and-coming companies,dividends, or value stocks. As with several of the larger, moreliquidETFs, some Japan ETFs can besold shortand are even accessible through listed options.\n\nHaving said that, many investors underestimate the effects thatcurrency fluctuationscan have ontotal returns.\u00a0If the U.S. dollar rises in value against the\u00a0Japanese yen (JPY), then an unhedged ETF will suffer currency losses that can offset any gains in the underlying Japanese stock market.\n\nDuring periods of dollar strength, many investors foundcurrency riskundesirable, paving the way for a rise in a category of ETFs thathedgeout\u00a0currency risk. Their goal is to give investors a return closer to the local currency returns of a country\u2019s major stock market indexes.\n\nThe performance of a Japan ETF may not correlate to the performance of the underlying index when it's measured in U.S. dollars. The changing exchange rate between the yen and the dollar should also taken into consideration.\n\nThere's no doubt that investing in Japan ETFs allows investors to diversify their holdings and enter a new market.But trading shares in these investmentshas other benefits. Similarly, adding these vehicles to an investment portfolio has downsides. We've listed some of the key pros and cons associated with Japan ETFs below.\n\nJapan has the third-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and is the home to many world-leading industrial and tech giants.The country's leading position in the world economy makes it a desirable destination for retail investors worldwide.\n\nThe Japan Exchange Group, which owns theTokyo Stock Exchange(TSE), is a large and progressive stock exchange in the Asia Pacific.This makes the country a frequent source of investor focus and attention. Japan ETFs allow for a singlediversified investmentin the country, while also making a bet on the strength of the yen versus the dollar.\n\nJapan has a fair number of economic issues, including decades ofdeflation, an aging population, and high levels ofdebt.\n\nJapan's market is also more limited than others\u2014notably, the U.S. ETF market\u2014both in size and variety. This difference\u00a0could be attributable to the fee structure for the Asian market in general. In the U.S., the trend has been toward afee-onlyfiduciary model for many investments. In Asia, on the other hand, many investment products continue to be sold by agents oncommission.\n\nProvide access to a large and progressive market\n\nOpen investors up to Japanese companies, which have competitive edge\n\nGive investors access to major companies and brands\n\nAre susceptible to economic risks\n\nHave access to a smaller market (size and variety)\n\nAsia-focused ETFs tend to be commission based\n\nThe iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ) is perhaps the best-known ETF in this category. The fund aims to produce investment results that correspond to the MSCI Japan Index using amarket capitalization-weightedmethod. In other words, a company\u2019s representation is based on its size.\n\niShares\u2019 Japan ETF and the MSCI Japan Index are very similar, ensuring littletracking error. Both are led by Toyota (TM), which accounts for over 5% of total assets as of January 2024, consisting mainly of industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, and technology stocks.\n\nThe largest Japan ETF is the iShares MSCI Japan ETF (EWJ), with $14.6 billion in assets under management as of January 2024. The fund invests in 225 leading Japanese companies, with the goal of tracking the MSCI Japan Index.\n\nJapan is one of the world's leading exporters of manufactured goods. The country is the world's second-largest exporter of automobiles, and also produces significant quantities of machinery and electronic equipment.\n\nAbenomics refers to the economic policies of Shinzo Abe, who led Japan as prime minister between 2006 and 2007 and again between 2012 and 2020. Abe steadily introduced a series of shareholder-friendly reforms, encouragingJapan Inc.to stop hoarding cash and increase dividends and stock repurchases.He also targeted negative interest rates, a controversial policy designed to stimulate spending and depreciate theyen.Since Japanese companies are big exporters, adevalued currencygives them a competitive edge.\n\nA Japan ETF invests in a basket of Japanese equities, allowing international investors to gain exposure to one of the world's largest manufacturing economies. Like other ETFs, Japan ETFs provide diversified exposure to a broad cross-section of the country's economy without relying on the success of any one company. However, international ETFs also come with some extra risks.\n\nMSCI. \"MSCI Japan Index (USD).\"\n\nJust ETF. \"How to Invest in Japan Using ETFs.\"\n\nThe World Bank. \u201cGDP (Current US$).\u201d\n\nStatista. \u201cLeading Stock Exchanges in the Asia Pacific Region as of May 2023, by Domestic Market Capitalization.\u201d\n\niShares. \"iShares MSCI Japan ETF.\"\n\nBlackRock. \"iShares MSCI Japan ETF.\"\n\nSantander Trade. \"Japanese Foreign Trade in Figures.\"\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research. \u201cBank of Japan Equity Purchases: The Final Frontier in Extreme Quantitative Easing.\u201d Pages 7-9.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations. \"Abenomics and the Japanese Economy.\"",
