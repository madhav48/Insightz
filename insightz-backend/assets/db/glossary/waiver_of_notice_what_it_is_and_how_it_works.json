  "term": "Waiver of Notice: What It Is and How It Works",
  "definition": "A waiver of notice is a legal document that is used to waive the requirement of formal notification and is often used to expedite legal proceedings.\n\nA waiver of notice is a document individuals sign that legally waives their rights to receive formal notices regarding certain probate issues.\n\nFor example, let's say that a family patriarch passes away and the estate is to be distributed among three children who are the sole heirs. Under normal circumstances, the probate court must issue a public notice regarding proceedings pertaining to the probate of the patriarch's will. However, if the named heirs\u2014all of whom have deeply vested interests in the assets\u2014consent to waivers of notice, an appointed administrator or executor may attend in their place. When this is done, courts can accelerate the probate process, benefitting the heirs by ultimately allowing them to receive their inheritances faster.\n\nA waiver of notice can be a massive timesaver for all relevant parties. However, it does not affect an individual's right to information. Rather, it simply means they may be excluded from prior notices.\n\nProbate courtsmainly deal with vital and sensitive issues such as wills,estates, and trusts. Therefore, interested parties are entitled to receive adequate notice about any probate hearings. A waiver of notice allows a representative to attend in the place of an heir, which can save both time and money as these proceedings normally subject heirs to lengthy waits and high legal fees.\n\nThere are potential downsides to waivers of notice. Namely, by signing one, it is difficult for an heir to later contest the estate by challenging the validity of a will or choice of executor. In the probate process, a hearing is required to make these challenges.\n\nFor heirs who wish to keep a close watch on the probate process, a waiver of notice may work against them, and they should decline to sign one.\n\nWaivers of notice don't solely apply to the process of probating a will. These legal documents can also be useful when a corporateboard of directorsor similar governing group needs to hold an emergency meeting. The notice allows them to do so, even if every board member isn't available to attend at a moment's notice.\n\nMore importantly, a notice provides an assurance that the proceedings of a meeting where notice is waived will be considered legal and valid if it is later challenged. In these cases, corporate attorneys recommend all directors sign a waiver of notice ahead of the meeting or a waiver of notice for future meetings. Copies of the signed waivers should be attached as evidence to the minutes of the meeting in question.\n\nThere are several potential risks of signing a waiver of notice. Chief among them for an heir is that it makes it difficult afterwards to contest a will or the way in which the estate is distributed among heirs. For corporate stakeholders, signing may lead to conflicts over the legitimacy of actions taken without notice.\n\nYes, you can refuse. The consequence will be that you retain your right to formal notice but the legal proceeding may be delayed.\n\nCourts don't take lightly the withdrawal of a waiver of notice. The party or person who requests a revocation must show that the waiver was obtained by\u00a0fraud\u00a0or\u00a0overreaching, was the product of\u00a0misrepresentation\u00a0or\u00a0misconduct, or that\u00a0newly discovered evidence, clerical error,\u00a0or\u00a0other sufficient cause\u00a0justifies revocation.\n\nA waiver of notice can expedite proceedings in probate court, but it can be difficult for an heir who has signed one to later revoke it. In corporate settings, an alternative to a waiver of notice may be used in its stead, such as a conditional waiver\u2014for example, for an emergency meeting\u2014or a limited waiver that only applies to certain issues.\n\nUpcounsel Technologies. \"Waiver of Notice: Uses, Risks, and Legal Requirements.\"\n\nBashian PC. \"Revoking a Waiver and Consent Is Not as Easy as You Think.\"",
