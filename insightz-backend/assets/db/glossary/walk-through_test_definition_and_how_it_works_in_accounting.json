  "term": "Walk-Through Test: Definition and How It Works in Accounting",
  "definition": "A walk-through test is performed by auditors to assess a company\u2019s accounting controls and its risk management measures.\n\nA walk-through test traces a transaction step-by-step through a company\u2019s accounting system from its inception to the final disposition of transactions. The intent is to ensure that the system is performing accurately. Walk-throughs aren\u2019t required for accountants but they can be instrumental in addressing weaknesses and problems.\n\nA walk-through test is only one of many tests performed byauditorsduring their evaluation of an organization'saccounting controlsand risk management measures. The test can reveal system deficiencies and material weaknesses that would need to be rectified by the organization as soon as possible.\n\nIn conducting a walk-through test, an auditor will study how a transaction is initiated and moves through a company or organization's accounting system to completion. This involves identifying how a transaction is authorized, recorded\u2014manually, by automated means, or both\u2014and then reported in thegeneral ledgerof the books. The auditor will want to know how controls for accuracy are applied at each step in the process and how follow-up steps are taken to improve controls.\n\nA good walk-through test will also document the personnel involved in transaction entries in the accounting system. Checklists and flowcharts help in conducting thorough walk-through tests. TheAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants(AICPA) recommends walk-through tests on an annual basis.\n\nWalk-through tests don\u2019t have to be a formal process, as many small businesses will perform a walk-through test without keeping detailed records or assessing a company\u2019s accounting records. That is, the auditor will observe and make inquiries without requesting detailed documentation or reviewing the paperwork or paper trail of the transaction.\n\nA walk-through test can be done by simply asking employee questions, although this isn\u2019t recommended. This is because an employee\u2019s description isn\u2019t always what happens in practice. The better method of a walk-through is observing employees\u2014how they process transactions, etc. As well, analyzing paperwork and documents is a step further in analyzing the company\u2019s accounting process.\n\nA walk-through will look different depending on the company and auditor, but broadly, the process should include a visual assessment of how the staff operates when recording a transaction. Next, the auditor will talk with anyone who handles the transaction and then review the documents related to the transaction. An auditor may also test the accounting controls if any are in place.\n\nAt the end of the walk-through, the auditor will outline the weaknesses in how the transaction was handled. The idea is that these weak points can then be corrected to improve a company\u2019s accounting system.",
