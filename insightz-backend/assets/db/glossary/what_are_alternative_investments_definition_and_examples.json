  "term": "What Are Alternative Investments? Definition and Examples",
  "definition": "Alternative investments comprise financial assets besides stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and exchange-traded funds.\n\nAn alternative investment is a financial asset that doesn't fall into one of the conventional investment categories. Conventional categories include stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments can include private equity or venture capital, hedge funds, managed futures, art and antiques, commodities, and derivatives contracts. Real estate is also often classified as an alternative investment.\n\nMost alternative investment assets are held byinstitutional investorsor accredited, high-net-worth individuals because of their complex nature, lack of regulation, and risk. Many alternative investments have high minimum investments and fee structures, especially when compared with mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThese investments also have fewer opportunities to publish verifiable performance data and advertise to potential investors. Although alternative assets may have high initial minimums and upfront investment fees, transaction costs are typically lower than those of conventional assets because of lower levels of turnover.\n\nMost alternative assets are fairly illiquid, especially compared with their conventional counterparts. For example, investors are likely to find it considerably more challenging to sell an 80-year-old bottle of wine than 1,000 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) because of the limited number of buyers.\n\nInvestors may have difficulty valuing alternative investments since the assets and transactions involving them are often rare. For example, a seller of a 1933 Saint-Gaudens Double Eagle $20 gold coin may have difficulty determining its value, as only 11 are known to exist, and only one can be legally owned.\n\nReal estate as a financial product includes investing in physical properties or property-based securities, real estate crowdfunding platforms,real estate investment trusts(REITs), andreal estate mutual funds. In addition tocapital appreciationof tangible assets, investors strive for operating income to potentially provide ongoing, stable cash flow.\n\nCommoditiesare raw materials such as gold, silver, oil, or agricultural products. Investors can invest in these tangible goods that have real-world uses and often perpetual demand due to the underlying characteristics of what they are. For example, gold's price is arguably more stable because it is used in a variety of industries and is considered astore of value.\n\nA blend of real estate and commodities, investors can turn to farmland as an alternative investment. In addition to the benefits of physical land, farm owners may also receive ongoing cash proceeds should operations and sales of commodities yield positive results.\n\nSome investments may double as a hobby, with art, sports memorabilia, entertainment memorabilia, high-end watches, or other collectibles acting as alternative investments. These items may have historical worth or develop worth over time as related parties (i.e. the artist, the associated movie star, or the associated athlete) become more historic.\n\nThe emerging form of digital currency, cryptocurrency is seen as an alternative investment as it is outside the traditional scope of stocks and bonds. Though some may claim cryptocurrency does not offer a strong hedge against other risk-on investments, it may provide capital appreciation or passive income due to staking rewards.\n\nBlurring the lines of an alternative investment,venture capital, or private equity is simply a refined branch of stock investments. Instead of trading shares of public companies in an open market, investors may seek alternative avenues toput capital into private companiesor start-ups.\n\nInvesting inpeer-to-peer lendingtranslates to making loans to individuals or businesses through online platforms that connect borrowers with investors. Peer-to-peer lending takes a very similar form to investing in bonds, though it is done on more private markets and often entails transacting with riskier clients, and thus is a risky investment.\n\nEven when they don't involve unique items like coins or art, alternative investments are prone to investment scams and fraud due to the lack of regulations.\n\nAlternative investments are often subject to a less clear legal structure than conventional investments. They do fall under the purview of theDodd-FrankWall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and their practices are subject to examination by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nHowever, they usually don't have to register with the SEC. As such, they are not overseen or regulated by the SEC as are mutual funds\u00a0and ETFs.\n\nSo, investors must conduct extensive due diligence when considering alternative investments. In some cases,\u00a0only accredited investors may invest in alternative offerings.\n\nAccredited investors are those with a net worth exceeding $1 million\u2014not counting their primary residence\u2014or with an annual income of at least $200,000 (or $300,000 combined with a spousal income) in each of the two previous years. Financial professionals who hold FINRA Series 7, 65, or 82 licenses may also qualify as accredited investors.\n\nMay offer diversification benefits\n\nOften have higher return potential than traditional investments\n\nMay offer protection against inflation\n\nMay offer investors more specialty investment options\n\nMay be less liquid and more difficult to sell in a hurry\n\nOften associated with higher fees and transaction costs\n\nOften have higher risk than traditional investments\n\nOften lacks transparency and may have reduced regulation\n\nMay not be right for novice investors due to their complexity\n\nBecause of their unique nature and differences from traditional markets, alternative investments may have low correlations to traditional investments such as stocks and bonds. Therefore, investors most often turn to alternatives to potentially help diversify an investment portfolio and reduce overall portfolio risk.\n\nAlternatives are considered riskier investments, and they often have the potential for higher returns compared to traditional investments.\n\nIn addition, alternative investments come in different forms and structures, giving investors the flexibility to choose the investment that best suits their preferences, risk appetite, and investment goals. For instance, investors may favor certain cryptocurrencies based onpassive incomeopportunities.\n\nAlternative investments may provide access to markets that are not available through traditional investments. Not only may investors find this more interesting (i.e. a baseball enthusiast may attach more passion to buying an autographed baseball), but that investor may find it more difficult to sell that collectible because there are likely to be fewer buyers, making the market less liquid.\n\nThis may be perceived as a benefit as this may enhance the price stability amongst investors as there is less of an opportunity to panic sell: transacting quickly based on emotion.\n\nBecause of their limited accessibility, alternative investments often have higher fees and expenses compared to traditional investments.\n\nFor example, private equity and hedge funds typically charge high management and performance fees, which can significantly reduce investors' returns. Whereas many brokers offer free trades of a number of stocks and bonds, many alternative investment products come at a cost.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, alternative investments are often illiquid which may be a benefit. However, consider the situation where an investor needs to quickly sell a rare piece of movie memorabilia because they need the cash. Because there may not be an active or large market, they may not be able to easily or quickly sell the item without incurring significant transaction costs or loss of value.\n\nBecause alternative investments may not bepublicly traded, obtaining market data on historical trends or pricing may be more difficult.\n\nWhereas public companies must comply with many reporting rules, some alternative investments may be subject to less regulatory oversight and have a higher risk of fraud, misconduct, and other abuses. As mentioned above, alternative investments tend to carry higher returns, though this is a function of their riskier nature.\n\nAlternative investments are also more often complex. Some may have complex structures and terms that can be difficult for investors to understand, increasing the risk of making uninformed or inappropriate investment decisions. Others may have no readily available market prices, making it difficult to determine their true value.\n\nGetting started with investing in alternative investments is very different based on the asset you're working with. Some may require substantial capital and research; others may simply require a few clicks of a mouse button. Very broadly speaking, here's how to get started with several types of alternatives.\n\nAs most alternative investments incur a transaction or processing fee, be mindful of maintenance or one-time fees when pursuing alternatives.\n\nBecause they represent an entirely different asset class compared to stocks and bonds, many alternative investment industries have different tax rules. In addition, consider how different alternatives may have different income streams (i.e. capital gain on the sale of a rental property in addition to rent revenue).\n\nSome alternative investments such as collectibles and art may not offer the same tax deductions as traditional investments like stocks and bonds. In addition, collectibles such as art or coins are explicitly defined by the IRS as a collectible, and net capital gains are subject to a maximum 28% tax rate.\n\nThe alternative investment industry is expected to grow to $24.5 trillion in assets under management by 2028.\n\nCryptocurrency and otherdigital asset tax rulescontinue to evolve. Digital assets such as virtual currency, cryptocurrency,stablecoins, and non-fungible tokens may incur taxable transactions when selling the asset for fiat, exchanging the asset for goods or services, or exchanging the asset for another digital asset. In addition, whereas fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar would not incur a taxable event, fluctuations in the value of digital assets often result in capital gains or losses.\n\nSome alternative investments such as real estate and certain types of energy investments may offer tax-deferred or tax-free investing options. This may include1031 exchangesand Opportunity Zone investments where investors can use proceeds from the sale of an alternative asset to invest in a similar or specific asset with those proceeds to avoid taxes.\n\nAs you embark on your alternative investment journey, consider talking with a financial advisor in addition to a tax advisor to best understand how to protect your asset and ensure maximum efficiency in protecting returns.\n\nRead about Investopedia's10 Rules of Investingby picking up a copy of our special issue print edition.\n\nAlternative investments tend to have high fees and minimum investment requirements, compared to retail-oriented mutual funds and ETFs. They also tend to have lower transaction costs, and it can be harder to get verifiable financial data for these assets. Alternative investments also tend to be less liquid than conventional securities, meaning that it may be difficult to value some of the more unique assets because they are so thinly traded.\n\nSomeinvestors seek out alternative investmentsbecause they have a low correlation with the stock and bond markets, meaning that they may maintain their values in a market downturn. Also, hard assets such as gold, oil, and real property are effective hedges against inflation. For these reasons, many large institutions such as pension funds and family offices seek to diversify some of their holdings into alternative investment vehicles.\n\nRegulations for alternative investments are less clear than they are for more traditional securities. Although alternative investment vehicles are regulated by the SEC, their securities do not have to be registered. As a result, most of these investment vehicles are only available to institutions or wealthy accredited investors.\n\nAlternative investments are investment options outside of traditional investments such as stocks, bonds, and cash. Alternative investments may include a wide range of assets such as real estate, commodities, private equity, hedge funds, art, collectibles, or cryptocurrencies. These investments are generally less liquid than traditional investments, though they may boast diversification and higher returns compared to more popular forms of investing.\n\nU.S. Mint. \"United States Mint Makes History With Display of Ten 1933 Double Eagles.\"\n\nU.S. Mint. \"The United States Government to Sell the Famed 1933 Double Eagle, the Most Valuable Gold Coin in the World.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"H.R.4173 - Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: Summary.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Mutual Funds and ETFs: A Guide for Investors,\" Page 8.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Accredited Investors \u2013 Updated Investor Bulletin.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Prepared Remarks At the Institutional Limited Partners Association Summit: Chair, Gary Gensler.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 409, Capital Gains and Losses.\"\n\nInvestmentNews. \"Global Alternatives Market Set to Reach $24.5T, Private Credit AUM to Double.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Digital Assets.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Opportunity Zones.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Like-Kind Exchanges Under IRS Section 1031.\"",
