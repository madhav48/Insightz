  "definition": "The infant-industry theory states that new industries in developing countries need protection against competitive pressures until they mature and developeconomies of scalethat can rival their competitors'. The infant industry argument is often cited as a rationale forprotectionismand was developed by Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List.\n\nThe infant-industry theory is the supposition that emerging domesticindustriesneed protection against international competition until they become mature and stable. In economics, an infant-industry is one that is new and in its early stages of development and, thus, not yet capable of competing against established industry competitors.\n\nThe infant-industry theory, first developed in the early 19th century by Alexander Hamilton and Friedrich List,\u00a0is often a justification for protectionist trade policies.The basic idea is that young,emerging industriesin underdeveloped nations need protection from more established industries, usually from foreign nations.\n\nIn response to these arguments, governments may enactimport duties, tariffs, quotas, andexchange rate controlsto prevent international competitors from matching or beating the prices of an infant industry, thereby giving the infant industry time to develop and stabilize.\n\nAccording to a paper in theJournal of International\u00a0Economics,titled \"When and how should infant industries be protected?\"\u00a0the infant-industry theory was later improved on by the economist and philosopherJohn Stuart Mill, who said that infant industries should only be protected if they can mature and then become viable without protection.\u00a0Charles Francis Bastable then added a simple condition that the cumulative net benefits provided by the protected industry must exceed the cumulative costs of protecting the industry.\n\nInfant-industry theorists\u00a0argue that industries in developing sectors of the economy need to be protected to keep international competitors from damaging or destroying the domestic infant industry. Infant industries, they argue, don't have the economies\u00a0of scale that older competitors in other countries may have and should be protected, just until they have built an economy of similar scale.\n\nThe infant-industry theory holds that once the emerging industry is stable enough to compete internationally, any protective measures introduced, such astariffs, are intended to be removed. In practice, this is not always the case because the various protections that were imposed may be difficult to remove.\n\nMelitz, Marc J. \"When and How Should Infant Industries Be Protected?\"Journal of International Economics, vol. 66, 2005, pp. 178.",
