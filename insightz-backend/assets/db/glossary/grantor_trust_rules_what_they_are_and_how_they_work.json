State laws determine if a trust is revocable or irrevocable.\n\nTrusts are designed as separate legal entities as part ofestate planningto protect the grantor's or originator's assets and the income generated from them so beneficiaries can receive them. A grantor trust allows the grantor or owner to retain the power to control or direct the income or assets within the trust.\n\nGrantor trusts were originally used as tax shelters. Tax rates for trusts once graduated along with income tax rates. The income was taxed at the personal income tax rates. The grantor reaped the benefits, shielding money taxed as an individual account not a separate legal entity.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) established grantor trust rules to thwart misuse. In 2024, the income generated from trusts graduates to a highertax bracketmore quickly than the individual marginal income tax rates. Any trust income over $15,200 in 2024 is taxed at the highest tax rate of 37%.Before grantor trust rules, the trust income wouldn't be taxed at the highest rate of 37% until it earned $609,350 in 2024 or $626,350 in 2025 if taxed at the individual tax rate.\n\nA trust may be exempt from grantor trust rules if it has a single beneficiary who is paid principal and income from the trust or has multiple beneficiaries who receive the principal and income by their shareholding in the trust.\n\nGrantor trust rules outline certain conditions under which an irrevocable trust can receive some of the same treatments by the IRS as a revocable trust. These situations sometimes lead to the creation of what are known as intentionally defective grantor trusts.\n\nA grantor\u00a0is\u00a0responsible for paying taxes on the income the trust generates in this case but assets aren't included in the owner's\u00a0estate. Assets would apply to a grantor's estate if the individual runs a revocable trust because they would effectively own property held by the trust.\n\nThe property is transferred out of the grantor's estate and into a trust with an irrevocable trust, which would then effectively own that property. Individuals often do this to ensure property is passed down to family members. A gift tax may be levied on the grantor based on the property's value when it's transferred into the trust but no estate tax would be due upon the grantor's death.\n\nGrantor trust rules state that a trust becomes a grantor trust if the creator has a reversionary interest greater than 5% of trust assets when the transfer of assets to the trust is made.\n\nSome grantor trust rules outlined by the IRS include the power to add beneficiaries, borrow from the trust, and use income to pay life insurance premiums.\n\nA tax shelter is an arrangement that holds assets or money in such a way as to reduce or avoid taxation on their value. Some employer-sponsored retirement plans are considered to be tax shelters as are financial accounts held and maintained in other countries. Grantor trusts once served as a form of legal tax shelter.\n\nIn some cases, yes. The trust must be revocable because the law allows this type of trust to be changed or undone after formation. The grantor/trustee names a successor trustee to take over at the time of their death or in the event of incapacitation that prevents them from managing the trust themselves.\n\nThe grantor of a personal trust is typically its creator. The grantor transfers their assets, money, and property into trust ownership except in a grantor trust. The creator is still considered the owner for income and estate tax purposes and can dissolve or change the trust\u2019s terms in the case of a revocable trust.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Abusive Trust Tax Evasion Schemes - Questions and Answers.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1041-ES.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Part III Administrative, Procedural, and Miscellaneous, 26 CFR 601.601, p.8.\" Page 8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"5.5.7 Collection Estate and Gift Tax Accounts.\" Section 5.5.7.32(09-16-2013)\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"2021 Instructions for Form 1041 and Schedules A, B, G, J, and K-1.\" Page 18.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"LB&I International Practice Service Process Unit - Audit.\" Page 20.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Number 201919003.\" Page 2.\n\nTax Policy Center. \"Briefing Book/What Is a Tax Shelter?\"\n\nVail Gardner Law. \"Learn Trust Basics: Who Is the Grantor vs. Trustee?\"",
