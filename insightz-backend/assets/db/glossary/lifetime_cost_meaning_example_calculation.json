  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nWhen you're considering buying something, you may know what the price tag says, but do you know what it truly costs? Taking into account the cost of maintaining something like a car, house, or boat can add up to a much higher number than just the purchase price. This total number is known as the lifetime cost.\n\nLifetime cost is an estimate of how much an item, such as a car, a home, or a piece of industrial machinery, will cost to own over the expected useful life of that item. It also includes cost of purchasing the item in the first place.\n\nBusinesses will frequently calculate lifetime costs before making large expenditures, upgrades, or renovations. For example, if they are buying a new piece of machinery, they will not only consider what it costs to buy initially but also what it's likely to cost to operate and maintain over its expected lifetime. Lifetime cost may also be referred to aswhole-life cost, life cycle cost, ortotal cost of ownership.\n\nIndividual consumers can also find it useful to calculate the lifetime cost before buying a home, boat, automobile, or other expensive item. Besides the initial purchase price, lifetime costs can include:\n\nAs a simple example, if a person bought a fur coat, the lifetime cost would include the purchase price as well as the expense of cleaning, storing, insuring, and otherwise maintaining the coat.\n\nOften, the lifetime cost of an item may be far greater than the initial purchase price. Many boat owners, for example, will recognize the truth of the old saying that the definition of a boat is a hole in the water into which you throw money.\n\nIn addition to lifetime cost, it can also be useful to look at theopportunity costof a particular expenditure. That refers to the potential benefits of spending the same amount of money in a different manner, such as investing it.\n\nLifetime costs can also include debt repayments. For example, the lifetime cost of an item financed through a credit card orline of credit (LOC)can be much greater than the purchase would have cost had it been paid for with cash. Unless the debt is paid off right away, the interest and fees on the credit card or credit line will add to the lifetime cost of the item.\n\nThe most dramatic example for most consumers would be the purchase of a home. For example, consider a $300,000 home purchased with a 20% down payment and a 30-year mortgage with an annual percentage rate of 7%.\n\nAssuming the homeowner keeps that home and mortgage for the next 30 years, by the time it is fully paid off, they will have paid about $335,445 in interest on the $240,000 they borrowed. Together with the $60,000 they put down initially, the repayment of the loan's $240,000 principal, and the $335,445 in interest, the $300,000 home will have cost them $635,445\u2014more than twice the original purchase price.\n\nAnd that, of course, doesn't include all the other lifetime costs associated with a home, such as property taxes, homeowners insurance, and routine maintenance. Nor does it include the opportunity cost of using that money differently.\n\nThat's the total amount that Americans pay in credit card interest and fees each year, as estimated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Using credit cards to purchase items can add to their lifetime cost unless the consumer pays their monthly balance in full.\n\nA car buyer will often compare makes and models, prices, desired features, and different dealers' financing offers before making their purchase. However, the cost of the vehicle does not end at the car lot.\n\nConsider the costs involved with weekly gas fill-ups, periodic oil changes, auto insurance, as well as licensing and vehicle inspection fees.\u00a0Other expenses may include a roadside assistance plan, car washes, and parking or garage rent.\n\nSo, for budgeting purposes, it makes sense to look not just at the vehicle's initial price but at what it will cost on an ongoing basis. Not only are some cars cheaper than others, but some may also be less expensive to maintain. It can also be the case that a car that's initially more expensive will be less costly on an annual basis, making it a better buy in the long run. The U.S. Department of Energy has an onlineVehicle Cost Calculatorthat allows users to compare the operating costs of up to eight different makes and models based on how much they drive.\n\nAccording to the American Automobile Association, the average new car costs $10,728 to own and operate. That includes loan finance charges, gasoline, maintenance, insurance, license and registration fees, and depreciation.\n\nDepreciationis an accounting method that is used to allocate the cost of a particular item over its useful lifetime. For example, a piece of office equipment that is expected to last for five years would lose 20% of its value every year until it has been fully depreciated. Depreciation is often taken into account in estimating the lifetime cost of an item.\n\nHow fast a car depreciates can vary greatly from model to model. As a general rule, the lender Capital One says that a new car may lose 20% of its value in the first year and another 10% to 15% each year over the next five years.\n\nResidual valuerefers to what an asset is worth after it has been fully depreciated for accounting purposes. The item may still be saleable to another buyer, in which case the seller will recoup some of the item's expected lifetime cost. A car, for example, may still have some resale or trade-in value even if you've driven it for quite a few years.\n\nLifetime cost is a useful way to estimate how much a particular item will cost to own and can be especially important in high-ticket purchasing decisions.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"CFPB Report Finds Credit Card Companies Charged Consumers Record-High $130 Billion in Interest and Fees in 2022.\"\n\nAmerican Automobile Association. \"Your Driving Costs 2022,\" Page 1.\n\nCapitol One. \"Is There a Standard Car Depreciation Formula?\"",
