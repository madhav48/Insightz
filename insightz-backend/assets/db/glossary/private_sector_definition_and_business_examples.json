  "definition": "The privatesectoris the part of the economy run by individuals and companies for profit and is not state-controlled. Therefore, it encompasses all for-profit businesses not owned or operated by the government. Government-run companies and corporations are part of what is known as the public sector, while charities and othernonprofit organizationsare part of the voluntary sector.\n\nThe private sector is the segment of a national economy that is owned, controlled, and managed by private individuals or enterprises. The private sector has a goal of making money and employs more workers than the public sector.\n\nA private-sector organization is created by forming a new enterprise or privatizing a public-sector organization. A large private-sector corporation may be privately orpublicly traded. Businesses in the private sector drive down prices for goods and services while competing for consumers\u2019 money; in theory, customers do not want to pay more for something when they can buy the same item elsewhere at a lower cost.\n\nIn mostfree economies, the private sector makes up a big portion of the economy, as opposed to nations that have more state control over their economies, which have a larger public sector. For example, the United States has a strong private sector because it has a free economy, while China, where the state controls many of its corporations, has a larger public sector.\n\nThe private sector is very diverse and makes up a big part of many economies. It is based on many different individuals, partnerships, and groups. The entities that form the private sector include:\n\nEven though the private sector is not directly controlled by any government entity, the government does legally regulate it. Any business or corporate entity must operate under the laws of the country it is based in.\n\nThe private sector employs workers through individual business owners, corporations, or other nongovernment agencies. Jobs include those in manufacturing, financial services, professions, hospitality, or other nongovernment positions. Workers are paid with part of the company\u2019srevenues.\n\nPrivate-sector workers tend to have more pay increases, more career choices, greater opportunities for promotions, less job security, and less comprehensive benefit plans than public-sector workers. Working in a more competitive marketplace often means longer hours in a more demanding environment than working for the government.\n\nThe public sector employs workers through the federal, state, or local government. Typical civil service jobs are inhealthcare, teaching, emergency services, armed forces, and various regulatory and administrative agencies.\n\nWorkers are paid through a portion of the government\u2019s tax dollars. Public-sector workers tend to have more comprehensive benefit plans and more job security than private-sector workers; once a probationary period concludes, many government positions become permanent appointments.\n\nMoving among public-sector positions while retaining the same benefits, holiday entitlements, and sick pay is relatively easy, while receiving pay increases and promotions is difficult. Working with a public agency provides a more stable work environment free of market pressures, unlike working in the private sector.\n\nTheBureau of Labor Statisticstracks and reports both private and public employment in the United States.\n\nThe private and public sectors sometimes work together while promoting common interests. Private-sector businesses leverage governmental assets and resources while developing, financing, owning, and operating public facilities or services. For example, aprivate companymight pay a state a one-time fee to operate a specific length of freeway for a set time in exchange for revenue from tolls.\n\nIn addition to generating profits, the private sector provides employment opportunities, delivers specific goods and services, helps develop industries or technologies, enables the functioning of a diverse group of businesses, and adds to the national income.\n\nThere are many types of companies or entities that constitute the private sector. They include sole proprietorships, partnerships,\u00a0and privately owned corporations.\n\nThe public sector consists of all companies or agencies that are government-owned or -associated. Examples include federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of Labor, state services such as police and fire departments, and a variety of additional organizations that provide services to the public overall.\n\nThe private sector is the part of the economy not run by the government. It comprises the businesses and enterprises that are controlled by private individuals and groups for the purpose of making a profit.\n\nCompanies and organizations run by the stateare considered to be the public sector. In free-market, capitalist-based societies, the private sector tends to make up a considerably larger portion of the economy than the public sector.\n\nCorrection\u2014Sept. 7, 2024:This article has been corrected to state that private-sector workers are paid with part of the company\u2019s revenues, not profits.",
