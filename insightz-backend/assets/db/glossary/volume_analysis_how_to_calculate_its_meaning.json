  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nVolume analysis is the examination of the number of shares or contracts of asecuritythat have been traded in a given period. Volume analysis is used by technical analysts as one of many factors that inform their trading decisions. By analyzing trends in volume in conjunction with price movements, investors can determine the significance of changes in a security's price.\n\nVolume analysis is done by all types of analysts following specific securities in the financial markets. Generally,volumerefers to the number of shares transacted per day. Having an understanding of the entire market\u2019s trading volume versus the volume of a single holding can be one important comparison that helps analysts todiscern volume trends.\n\nOftentimes, high volumes of trading can infer a lot about investors\u2019 outlook on a market or security. A significant price increase along with a significant volume increase, for example, could be a credible sign of a continued bullish trend or a bullish reversal. Adversely, a significant price decrease with a significant volume increase can point to a continued bearish trend or a bearish trend reversal.\n\nIn general, it can be important for technical analysts to include volume charts in daily charting diagrams. Volume charts are usually available below a standardcandlestickgraph. These charts will also usually display moving average trendlines.\n\nIncorporating volume into a trading decisioncan help an investor to have a more balanced view of all the broad market factors that could be influencing a security\u2019s price which helps an investor to make a more informed decision.\n\nIn technical analysis, there are two popular indicators designed specifically to support investors that incorporate volume into their trading decisions. ThePositive Volume Index (PVI)and Negative Volume Index (NVI) were developed by Paul Dysart in the 1930s. These indexes increased in popularity in 1975 when they were discussed in a 1976 book titled \"Stock Market Logic\" by Norman Fosback.\n\nThe PVI and NVI are both based on the previous day\u2019s trading volume and a security\u2019s market price. When trading volume increases from the previous day the PVI is adjusted. When trading volume decreases from the previous day the NVI is adjusted. These basic index calculations show how volume is affecting price.\n\nWhen PVI increases or decreases, it means that price changes are being driven by high volumes. Conversely, when NVI increases or decreases it means that prices are fluctuating with little effect from volume.\n\nIf current volume is greater than the previous day's volume:\n\nIf current volume is lower than the previous day's volume, PVI is unchanged.\n\nIf the current volume is less than the previous day\u2019s volume:\n\nIf the current volume is higher than the previous day's volume, NVI is unchanged. Many investors believe thatnoise tradingis a significant factor in the Positive Volume Index. Therefore, the Negative Volume Index is often followed for its insight into professional traders' market activity.\n\nInvestopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice.
