International finance research is conducted by large institutions such as theInternational Finance Corp.(IFC), and theNational Bureau of Economic Research(NBER). Furthermore, the U.S. Federal Reserve has a division dedicated to analyzing policies germane to U.S. capital flow, external trade, and the development of global markets.\n\nInternational finance analyzes the following specific areas of study:\n\nTheBretton Woods systemwas created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944, where the 40 participating countries agreed to establish a fixed exchange rate system. The collective goal of this initiative was to standardize international monetary exchanges and policies in a broader effort to create post World War II stability.\n\nThe Bretton Woods conference catalyzed the development of international institutions that play a foundational role in the global economy. These include theInternational Monetary Fund(IMF), a consortium of 189 countries dedicated to creating global monetary cooperation, and theInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which later became known as the World Bank.\n\nInternational trade is arguably the most important influencer of global prosperity and growth. But there are worries related to the fact the United States has shifted from being the largest international creditor, to becoming the world's largest international debtor, absorbing excess amounts of funding from organizations and countries on a global basis. This may affect international finance in unforeseen ways.\n\nInternational finance involves measuring the political and foreign exchange risk associated with managing multinational corporations.",
