  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nRunoff insurance is an insurance policy provision that covers claims made against companies that have been acquired, merged, or have ceased operations.\u00a0Runoff insurance, also known as closeout insurance, is purchased by the company being acquired andindemnifies\u2014exempts from liability\u2014the acquiring company from lawsuits against the directors and officers of the acquired company.\n\nAcquiring a company means taking possession\u00a0of its assets, but also its liabilities, including those\u00a0only be discovered in the future. Obligations arise for many reasons. Third\u00a0parties may feel that they were not treated fairly in contracts.\u00a0Investors may feel upset with how the previous directors and officers ran the business. Competitors may claim infringement of intellectual property rights. An acquiring company might demand that the company being acquired purchase runoff insurance to protect itself from these liabilities.\n\nA runoff policy is a type ofclaims-made policyrather than an occurrence policy. The difference in policy type is because the claim may be made several years after the incident that caused damage or loss, and occurrence policies provide coverage only during the period that the policy was active. The length of the runoff policy, referred to simply as the \u201crunoff,\u201d\u00a0is typically set for several years after the policy becomes active. The provision is purchased by the acquiring company, and the purchase funds are often included in the acquisition price.\n\nProfessionals may also purchase runoff insurance to cover professional liabilities that occur after a business has closed. For example, a physician who closes their private practice may purchase runoff insurance to protect themselves from claims filed by previous patients. This type of policy is typically renewed until the statute of limitations on filing a claim has passed. If the business continues to offer services, its policies typically extend indemnification making the purchase of a runoff provision unnecessary.\n\nThe following insurance policies should have a runoff provision: directors and officers (D&O) insurance, fiduciary liability insurance, professional liability (E&O) insurance, and employment practices liability (EPL) insurance.\n\nConsider a hypothetical runoff\u00a0policy written for a term between\u00a0Jan.\u00a01, 2017, and Jan.\u00a01,\u00a02018. In this situation, coverage will apply\u00a0to all claims caused by wrongful acts committed between Jan.\u00a01, 2017, and\u00a0Jan.\u00a01,\u00a02018, that are\u00a0reported to the insurer from Jan. 1, 2018, to Jan. 1, 2023. That is, the five years immediately following the end of the policy term.\n\nThe North American runoff reserve in 2021, per PricewaterhouseCoopers' Global Insurance Runoff Survey 2021\u2014compared to $302 billion for the U.K. and Continental Europe Markets.\n\nAlthough runoff insurance provisions function similarly toextended reporting period(ERP) provisions, there are several differences. First, ERPs are typically only for one-year terms, whereas runoff provisions normally encompass multi-year periods. Second, ERPs are frequently\u00a0purchased when the insured individual switches from one claims-made insurer to another, whereas runoff provisions are used when one insured is acquired by or merges with another.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers. \"Global Insurance Run-off Survey 2021.\" Accessed Sept. 5, 2021.",
