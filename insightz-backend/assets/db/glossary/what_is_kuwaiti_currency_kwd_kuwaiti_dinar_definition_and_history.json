  "term": "What Is Kuwaiti Currency? KWD (Kuwaiti Dinar) Definition and History",
  "definition": "The Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) is the national currency of the State of Kuwait, which is located in the Middle East on the Arabian Peninsula right on the Persian Gulf.\u00a0The dinar name derives from the Roman denarius. The KWD, which is the dinar\u2019sforexacronym, subdivides\u00a0into 1000 fils, which is a coin used in many Arab countries.\n\nKuwait\u2019s economy is heavily reliant on oil, making it one of the wealthiest nations in the world as measured by gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.\n\nThe introduction of the Kuwaiti dinar (KWD) in 1961 was a replacement for the Gulf rupee. The Gulf rupee was a currency\u00a0peggedat parityto the Indian rupee. Issued in 1959 by the Indian government, the Gulf rupee was\u00a0for use outside of India, particularly in the Persian Gulf region. Like the\u00a0Indian rupee, the Gulf rupee was pegged to theBritish pound sterling (GBP).\n\nIn\u00a01961, Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom with the end of treaties put in place after the defeat of the Ottoman Empire.\n\nKuwaiti Currency Law created the Kuwaiti Currency Board, which later became the Central Bank of Kuwait, with the purpose of establishing a Kuwaiti currency. The Central Bank of Kuwait introduced the Kuwaiti dinar as a replacement for the Gulf rupee. Until 1966, both currencies circulated, but the use of the rupee ended after itsdevaluation.\n\nFrom 1975 to 2003, the Kuwaiti dinar waspeggedto a weighted currency basket. The content of the currency basket was mandated by the Central Bank of Kuwait. In 2003, the KWD was pegged to theU.S.\u00a0dollar (USD)at 0.29963 dinars to the dollar. This valuation continued until 2007, when it was formally re-pegged to an undisclosed basket of currencies.\n\nAs of July 2024, one Kuwaiti dinar is worth about $3.27, making it one of the most valuable currencies in the world.\n\nThe State of Kuwait has a petroleum product-based economy, with 90% of government revenues coming from the oil industry. The State of Kuwait is a tax-free country, with one of thelowest unemployment ratesin the world.\n\nTheKuwait Investment Authority (KIA)is the oldest sovereign wealth fund in the world, and the investment industry of the country manages more assets than any other member of the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC), a regional economic and political union.\n\nThere have been six official issues of the Kuwaiti dinar banknotes since the first circulation in 1961. There have also been two\u00a0commemorative sets circulated.\n\nThe third series, released in 1980 upon the crowning of Emir Jaber al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, was in use until Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Upon invasion, the Iraqi government installed the Iraqi dinar as the official currency for the area.\n\nThe GDP of Kuwait in 2023, which fell from to $182.81 billion in 2022.\n\nThe\u00a0invading Iraqi forces stole\u00a0an enormous number of Kuwaiti dinar banknotes. With the liberation of Kuwait, the invalidation of the third dinar issue forced the replacement of the fourth issue of the currency in 1991.\n\nThe 1994 series implemented enhanced security features.\n\nThe sixth series came in 2014 with bills specially textured so blind and vision-impaired people can identify them\u00a0by touch.\n\nBetween July 2014 and July 2024, the Kuwaiti dinar fluctuated between $3.17 and $3.54. That means that it costs between $3.17 and $3.54 to buy one Kuwaiti dinar.\n\nThe higherrate, $3.54, means that the Kuwaiti dinar appreciated in value, or the U.S. dollar had fallen in value relative to the dinar. If the rate falls, that means that the Kuwaiti dinar is losing value, or that the U.S. dollar is gaining value relative to it.\n\nDue to its relatively low volatility, and limited global trade, the Kuwaiti dinar is not typically used as a speculative trading instrument. If it were, a trader would attempt to buy near the lower end of its historical range, and try to sell near the top of it. Buying at $3.17 and selling at $3.54\u2014the price range over 10 years\u2014represents an 11.67% profit, not including fees and commissions.\n\nThis is why most traders and investors stay away from trading this currency unless they feel a major fundamental shift may be forthcoming that could cause a major shift in the value of the currency.\n\nThe Kuwaiti currency is pegged to a basket of currencies as opposed to one currency. The basket of currencies is not disclosed but is expected to be heavily weighted toward the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe KWD is so valuable because the demand for the currency is very high. The economy of Kuwait is primarily dependent on oil, but not only that, it is a stable country that uses its oil revenue efficiently, unlike many oil-rich countries. In addition, it is a large exporter of oil. Because the demand for global oil is high, the demand to pay for it in Kuwaiti currency is also high, making the KWD a very valuable currency.\n\nYes, Kuwait\u2019s currency is more valuable than the U.S. dollar because the demand for the KWD is high due to Kuwait being a large producer of oil. That being said, the U.S. dollar is the world\u2019s reserve currency and is accepted more widely.\n\nThe Kuwaiti dinar is the most valuable currency in the world due to Kuwait\u2019s strong and stable economy, whose strength comes from its vast oil reserves and tax-free economy. This creates a high demand for the Kuwaiti dinar.\n\nThe CIA World Factbook. \u201cKuwait: Economy.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank, World Bank Open Data. \u201cGDP per Capita (Current US$)\u2014Kuwait, World.\u201d\n\nXe. \u201c1 KWD to USD\u2014Convert Kuwaiti Dinars to U.S. Dollars.\u201d\n\nHoward M.
