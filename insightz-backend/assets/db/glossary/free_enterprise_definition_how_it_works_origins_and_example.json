  "term": "Free Enterprise: Definition, How It Works, Origins, and Example",
  "definition": "Free enterprise describes an economic system in which prices, products, and services are determined by market forces rather than government intervention. In such a system, businesses operate independently with minimal regulatory control. Key features include private property rights and voluntary exchanges.\n\nFree enterprise is a system wherein market forces determine the production, supplies, and prices of goods and services. As such, it is also referred to as afree market. Free markets are, in principle and practice, defined by private property rights, voluntary contracts, and competitive bidding for goods and services in the marketplace. This is contrasted with public ownership of property, coercive activity, and fixed or controlled distribution of goods and services.\n\nAnother definition of free enterprise is in terms of economics and was offered by the Nobel-winning economistFriedrich Hayek. Hayek described\u00a0such systems as spontaneous order. Hayek's point was that free enterprise is not unplanned or unregulated. Instead, he said that planning and regulation arise from\u00a0the coordination of decentralized knowledge among innumerable specialists, not bureaucrats.\n\nA free enterprise legal system tends to producecapitalismin the absence ofcentral planning. This may lead to voluntary socialism or even agrarianism. In capitalist economic systems (think of the United States), consumers and producers determine which goods and services to produce and which to purchase. Contracts are entered into voluntarily and may even be enforced privately. Competitive bidding determines market prices.\n\nIn Western countries, free enterprise is associated withlaissez-faire economiesand philosophical libertarianism. However, free enterprise is distinct from capitalism. Capitalism refers to a method by which scarce resources are\u00a0produced and distributed. Free enterprise refers to a set of legal rules regarding commercial interaction.\n\nFree enterprise may also be referred to as free trade or free market.\n\nA free enterprise society hopes to achieve different goals. When a free enterprise society is fully operational, consumers often have freedom, efficiency, stability, security, growth opportunities, and justice.\n\nThe first written intellectual reference to\u00a0free enterprise systems may have emerged in China in the fourth or fifth century BC when Laozi (or Lao-tzu) argued that governments hampered growth and happiness by interfering with individuals.\n\nLegal codes resemblingfree enterprise systemswere not common until much later. The original home of contemporary free markets was England between the 16th and 18th centuries. This growth coincided with and probably contributed to the firstindustrial revolutionand the birth of modern capitalism. At one time, the English legal code was completely free of international trade barriers, tariffs,barriers to entryin most industries, and limitations on private business contracts.\n\nThe United States also used a largely free-market legal approach during the 18th and 19th centuries. In modern times, however, both the United States and the United Kingdom are better classified asmixed economies. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, and Switzerland are more reflective\u00a0of free enterprise.\n\nThe opposite of a free enterprise economy is a planned, controlled, or command economy.\n\nThe U.S. economic system of free enterprise has five main principles: the freedom for individuals to choose businesses, the right to private property, profits as an incentive, competition, and consumer sovereignty.\n\nIn a free enterprise, the market faces nobureaucracy. Processes are theoretically more efficient and may be administratively less expensive to operate a business and interact with consumers. This is especially true in highlyregulated markets, though increased competition may shift costs elsewhere.\n\nMarket participants are usually allowed greater expression and flexibility. Entrepreneurs aren't constrained by public policy or dictated on what goods need to be produced. A cornerstone theory of free enterprise is that the best companies will innovate to continue to meet marketdemand, while companies that fail\u00a0will cease to exist as they no longer have a place in the market.\n\nInstead of government policy deciding how resources are allowed, a free enterprise's large benefit is that consumers have a greater voice in the economy. The consumer determines the ultimate prices of a good, which products are needed in a market, and what goods fail or succeed. It is up to a firm in a free enterprise to understand these consumer preferences and adjust their operations accordingly.\n\nGoods that are generally not profitable to manufacture will not be produced in a free enterprise. This is because there is no economic incentive for a firm to produce these goods\u2014unless there is government aid or astipend. This may also include limitations on where goods are delivered. For example, government funds may partially pay for telecommunication services to be distributed to rural areas. Without this funding, those communities may not receive service.\n\nA free enterprise may also spur unfavorable activity due to the prioritization of profits. ConsiderEnron, which didn't follow public financial reporting regulations resulting in financial ruin. When there are little to no rules to follow, entities within a free enterprise may sacrifice worker safety, environmental standards, or ethical behavior in favor of making more money.\n\nA free enterprise doesn't come withbailouts. This means economic downturns are theoretically more severe, as public funds can't be used to aid failing institutions that would cause major ripple effects by dissolving. This is especially true in today's interconnected society where one largebankruptcycould negatively financially impact firms around the world.\n\nMay be less expensive to operate a business\n\nAllows for greater entrepreneurial freedom\n\nPrioritizes consumer demand and preferences\n\nMay result in unprofitable products being dissolved\n\nMay restrict where goods are distributed to\n\nMay entice illicit behavior due to prioritizing profits\n\nMay result in greater market crashes due to no bailouts\n\nConsider the differences between two companies: Apple (AAPL), a public company, and SunGard Data Systems, aprivate company. Because both companies transact within the United States, neither is truly in a free enterprise environment.\n\nImagine each company wants toraise capital. TheSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC)has outlined regulations that public companies like Apple must meet to sell additional shares and be listed on public exchanges. This also includes meeting public reporting and filing requirements.With fewer restrictions in place as a private company, SunGard Data Systems may raise capital more freely\u00a0as it does not experience as many government restrictions.\n\nAnother example of free enterprise (or lack thereof) is the financial crisis that led to theGreat Recession. In response to the economic calamity, Congress authorized the use of theTrouble Assets Relief Program (TARP)emergency funds for distressed financial institutions.In a truly free enterprise, governments would not intervene to aid struggling businesses. Instead, these companies would be allowed to fail, allowing for the market to resolve itself with new market participants entering the space to claim the newly vacated market opportunity.\n\nThe main goal of free enterprise is to allow citizens to dictate market and decide the value of trade. Instead of relying on government intervention or public policy, free enterprise's main goal is to allow markets to move themselves without constraint, self-discovering efficiencies and inaccuracies.\n\nSome may argue the main benefit of free enterprise is freedom. In one sense, individuals may transact with little to no restricting barriers, especially those set by policy or trade regulation. In another sense, individuals are allowed to creatively express and transact based on a seemingly endless range of consumer choices.\n\nFree enterprise and capitalism are related, though the two terms are different. Free enterprise refers to how a free market system has minimal barriers regarding the exchange of wealth or transacting of goods and services. On the other hand, capitalism is primarily centered on the creation of that wealth or production of those goods. Both relate to an individual initiating their own decisions with fewer market mechanisms governing the control of their resources.\n\nWhereas free enterprise is the notion around letting goods and services freely generate market results on their own, socialism is focused on governing how resources are distributed. These government policies may dictate how resources are used, who receives goods, or what pricing mechanisms certain market participants may face.\n\nFree enterprise refers to an economic concept where markets are not governed by policy. Instead, market participants set pricing, do not face export or regulation requirements, and have more freedom in choosing how they transact. Though free enterprise is rooted in granting individuals more freedom, market failures may be more devastating without government intervention.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. \"Hayek's Legacy of the Spontaneous Order.\"\n\nMises Institute. \"The Ancient Chinese Libertarian Tradition.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Going Public.\"\n\nU.S. Department of the Treasury. \"Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP).\"",
