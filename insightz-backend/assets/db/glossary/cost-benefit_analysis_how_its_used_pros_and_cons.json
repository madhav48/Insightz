  "definition": "A cost-benefit analysis (CBA) is a process of comparing the projected costs and benefits of a decision to determine its feasibility.\u00a0Businesses can determine whether a decision is worthwhile by summing up the potential rewards expected from an action and subtracting the associated costs.\u00a0If the benefits outweigh the costs, the decision is likely worthwhile for the business.\n\nA cost-benefit analysis doesn't always involve concrete numbers or measurements. Consultants oranalysts, for example, could create models to assign a dollar value to intangible factors, such as the benefits and costs of living in a particular town.\n\nMichela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nCost-benefit analysis (CBA) estimates and assesses the value of a project's benefits and costs to determine whether or not it's worth pursuing. Originating from the work of Jules Dupuit and Alfred Marshall and developed further by the U.S. Corps of Engineers in the 1930s, CBA involves comparing all current and projected costs and benefits of a project, both monetary and intangible.\n\nBefore taking on a new project, prudent managers perform a CBA to evaluate all the potential costs and\u00a0revenues\u00a0it might generate. The analysis's outcome determines whether the project is financially viable or whether a company should consider other alternatives.\n\nMany CBA models also factoropportunity costinto the decision-making process. Opportunity cost represents the potential benefits a business misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. It accounts for the value of the next best option that isn't selected, highlighting the trade-offs involved in any decision.Evaluating opportunity cost can make the decision-making process more comprehensive and effective.\n\nFinally,\u00a0a manager will compare the total costs and benefits to determine if the benefits outweigh the costs. If they do, the rational decision is to proceed with the project. If not, the business reviews the project to see if adjustments can be made to increase benefits or decrease costs to make it viable. Otherwise, the project should likely be avoided.\n\nWith cost-benefit analysis, a degree of forecasting is built into the process. If any of the forecasts are inaccurate, the results may not be reliable.\n\nThere is no single, universally accepted method of performing a cost-benefit analysis. However, the process usually has some variation of the following five steps.\n\nThe first step in a cost-benefit analysis is understanding the current situation, identifying goals, and establishing a framework to define the project scope.\u00a0Begin by determining the purpose of the cost-benefit analysis. For example, the purpose might be \"to decide whether to expand to increasemarket share\" or \"to evaluate the benefits of overhauling the company website.\"\n\nIn this initial stage, the project planning takes place. This includes:\n\nA company must assess whether it's equipped to perform an accurate cost-benefit analysis. If the business doesn't have the technical staff needed for an adequate assessment, it may need to hire outside professionals.\n\nDuring this phase, the business should identify key stakeholders who will be impacted by the analysis and give them a chance to provide input on the process. For example, if the outcome would be to renovate a company's website, the IT department may be required to hire multiple additional staff or take on extra work. They should be consulted about the impact this will have on their department, workflow, and other projects.\n\nWith the framework behind you, it's time to start looking at numbers. The second step of a cost-benefit analysis is to determine the project costs.\n\n\"Costs\" can be financial, such as expenses recorded on an income statement, or non-financial, such as negative repercussions on the community. These costs can be categorized as follows:\n\nWhen determining costs, consider if they're recurring or one-time expenses. Additionally, evaluate whether costs are variable or fixed. For fixed costs, consider step costs and relevant ranges that could impact those expenses.\n\nUsingnet present value (NPV)in project decisions offers the benefit of considering an alternative rate of return that could be earned if the project weren't undertaken. A positive NPV indicates that the projected earnings exceed the anticipated costs, making the project a worthwhile investment, while a negative NPV suggests the opposite.\n\nEvery project will have different underlying principles, and the benefits might be tangible or intangible. These could include:\n\nIn this stage, the project manager or analyst performing the cost-benefit analysis will need to determine both explicit and implicit benefits. Explicit benefits require future assumptions about market conditions, sales volumes, customer demand, and product expectations. Implicit benefits, such as the impact of increased employee satisfaction, may be difficult to quantify as there's no straightforward formula to calculate the financial effect of happier workers.\n\nFor the analysis to work, each type of benefit will need a monetary value assigned to it.\n\nBe careful not to underestimate costs or overestimate benefits. A conservative approach that avoids subjective tendencies when calculating estimates is best for assigning value to both costs and benefits.\n\nWith the cost and benefit figures in hand, it's time to perform the analysis. This involves concisely summarizing the costs, benefits, net impact, and how the findings support the original purpose of the analysis.\n\nHowever, some cost-benefit analyses require more detailed examination. This may include:\n\nIf a cost-benefit analysis is positive, the project offers more benefits than costs. However, a company must consider its limited resources, which may force it to make mutually exclusive decisions. For example, a company with limited capital might find positive cost-benefit analyses for upgrading its warehouse, website, and equipment, but it may not have enough funds to pursue all three projects at the same time.\n\nNot all cost-benefit analyses that result in net benefit should be accepted. For example, a company must consider the project's risk, alignment with its company image, and capital limitations.\n\nThere are many reasons to perform a cost-benefit analysis. The technique relies on data-driven decision-making with recommendations based on quantifiable information. It also keeps that information specific to a single problem, rather than over-complicating the decision that needs to be made by considering too many factors at once.\n\nA cost-benefit analysis requires substantial research across all costs, including unpredictable ones, and a thorough understanding of expense types and characteristics. This extensive research strengthens the findings and supportsstrategic planningefforts.\n\nA cost-benefit analysis also requires quantifying non-financial metrics, such as the financial benefit of increased employee satisfaction. Although challenging to assess, this process forces the analyst to consider aspects of the project that are harder to measure. The ultimate goal is to deliver a straightforward report that simplifies decision-making.\n\nAccurately performing a detailed cost-benefit analysis requires capital and resources, such as personnel and dedicated time. For smaller decisions, this may be more expensive than is worthwhile for the project.\n\nA cost-benefit analysis relies heavily on estimates and forecasts. It may be possible to make accurate forecasts for mid-level capital expenditures over short or intermediate periods of time. However, for large projects with a long-term time horizon, a cost-benefit analysis might overlook critical factors, such as inflation, interest rates, varying cash flows, and thepresent valueof money.\n\nIf these factors are either over- or underestimated, the entire cost-benefit analysis becomes unreliable.\n\nAvoids considering too many options at once\n\nDeeper, potentially more reliable findings\n\nInsights to financial and non-financial outcomes\n\nMay be unnecessary for smaller projects\n\nRelies heavily on forecasted figures\n\nOver or underestimating can make findings inaccurate\n\nThe broad process of a cost-benefit analysis is to set the analysis plan, determine your costs, determine your benefits, perform an analysis of both costs and benefits, and make a final recommendation. These steps may vary from one project to another.\n\nThe main goal of cost-benefit analysis is to determine whether it is worth undertaking a project or task. This decision is made by gathering information on the costs and benefits of that project. Management leverages the findings of a cost-benefit analysis to decide whether it is in the best interest of a company to pursue a new project or to find an alternative.\n\nCost-benefit analysis is a systematic method for quantifying and then comparing the total costs to the total expected rewards of undertaking a project or making an investment. Each cost and benefit, whether tangible or intangible, is assigned a numerical cost. This can require estimating and forecasting, which should be done as accurately as possible. If the benefits greatly outweigh the costs, the decision should go ahead; otherwise, it should probably not. A cost-benefit analysis should also include the opportunity costs of missed or skipped projects.\n\nDepending on the specific investment or project being evaluated, a cost-benefit analysis may require discounting the time value of cash flows using net present value calculations. Abenefit-cost ratio (BCR)may also be computed to summarize the overall relationship between the relative costs and benefits of a proposed project. Other tools may includeregressionmodeling, valuation, andforecastingtechniques.\n\nThe process of doing a cost-benefit analysis itself has its own inherent costs and benefits. The costs involve the time needed to carefully understand and estimate all of the potential rewards and costs. This may also involve money paid to an analyst or consultant to carry out the work. One other potential downside is that various estimates and forecasts are required to build the cost-benefit analysis, and these assumptions may prove to be wrong or even biased.\n\nThe benefits of a cost-benefit analysis, if done correctly and with accurate assumptions, are to provide a good guide for decision-making that can be standardized and quantified.\n\nSome complex problems require deeper analysis, and a company can use cost-benefit analysis when it isn't immediately clear whether or not to pursue a new project, expansion, or other undertaking. By determining the expenses and identifying what will be favorable, a company can simplify decision-making by synthesizing a cost-benefit analysis.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to be aware of the limitations and challenges of CBA. Although it provides a structured method for decision-making, its accuracy relies heavily on the precision of forecasts and assumptions. Incorrect estimates of future costs or benefits can result in faulty conclusions. Despite these challenges, when performed with careful consideration and accurate data, CBA is a valuable tool for strategic planning and resource allocation.\n\nHarvard Business School. \"How to Do a Cost-Benefit Analysis and Why It's Important.\"\n\nSan Jose State University. \"An Introduction to Cost Benefit Analysis.\"\n\nMercatus Center at George Mason University. \"Accounting for the Opportunity Cost of Capital in Cost-Benefit Analysis: Public Interest Comment on the Marginal Excess Tax Burden as a Potential Cost under Executive Order 13771.\"",
