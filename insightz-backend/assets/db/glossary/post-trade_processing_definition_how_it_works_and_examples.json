  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nPost-trade processing occurs after a trade is complete. At this point, the buyer and thesellercompare trade details, approve the transaction, change records of ownership, and arrange for the transfer ofsecuritiesand cash. Post-trade processing is especially important in markets that are not standardized, such as the over-the-counter (OTC) markets.\n\nPost-trade processing is important in that it verifies the details of a transaction. Markets and prices move fast;transactionsare executed quickly, often instantaneously. Many securitiestradesare done over the phone; the ability for mistakes is inherent, despite traders\u2019 skill. Increasingly trades are executed at high frequency by computers only. The chance for small mistakes to compound remains high.\n\nPost-trade processing allows the buyer and seller of securities to root out and rectify these errors. In addition to matching the details of the buy and sell orders, post-trade processing includes shifting records of ownership and authorizing payment.\n\nAfter a trade is executed, the transaction enters what is known as thesettlement period.\u00a0During settlement, the buyer must make payment for the securities they purchased while the seller must deliver the security that was acquired. Depending on the type of security, settlement dates will vary. As an example of how settlement dates work, let's say that an investor buys shares of Amazon (AMZN) on Monday, June 3, 2024. Thebrokerwill debit the investor's account for the total cost of the order immediately after it's filled, but the status as a shareholder of Amazon will not be settled in the company's record books for the investor until Tuesday, June 4. At that time, theinvestorwould become ashareholderof record.\n\nOnce the trade has settled, and the funds in any sale of stock or another type of security have been credited to your account, the investor may choose to withdraw the funds, reinvest in new security, or hold the amount in cash within the account. For those looking to cash out some of the profits (or what's left from a loss), check to see if your broker offers transfers to your bank account using the Automated Clearing House (ACH) or by using a wire transfer.\n\nThe settlement period for post-trade processing of stocks and several other exchange-traded assets. Effective May 28, 2024, the SEC shortened the settlement period fromT+2 to T+1 daysto\u00a0reflect improvements in technology, increased trading volumes, and changes in investment products and the trading landscape.\n\nClearingis the process of reconciling purchases and sales of various\u00a0options, futures, or\u00a0securities, as well as the direct transfer of funds from one financial institution to another. The process validates the availability of the appropriate funds, records the transfer, and in the case of securities\u00a0ensures the delivery of the security\u00a0to the buyer. Non-cleared trades can result insettlement risk, and if trades do not clear accounting errors will arise where real money can be lost.\n\nAnout tradeis a trade that cannot be placed because it was received by anexchangewith conflicting information. The associated\u00a0clearinghouse\u00a0cannot settle the trade because the data submitted\u00a0by parties on both sides of thetransaction is inconsistent or contradictory.\n\nOn the NYSE Bonds Platform, following trade completions, all Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) / National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) Regional Interface Organization (RIO) eligible bond trades are sent to NSCC in order to match trade details of both buyers and respective sellers. Details are transmitted through the RIO.\n\nPost-trade services have come to the forefront as a means for financial firms to diversify their revenue streams. Due to a combination of heightened regulations, standardization of derivatives, and increasingly complex processing measures to accommodate the growth of alternative assets, post-trade services are an area\u00a0in which some firms have a chance to outstrip competitors.\n\nYes. In May 2024, the SEC shortened the clearing time for most stock trades to T+1. It is exploring the feasibility of same-day settlement, or T+0.\n\nIf you buy or sell shares of stock or other securities, the settlement date will typically be one day after the actual trade date. This is because it takes time for the post-trade processing, clearing, and settlement of the trade. Barriers to same-day settlement include older systems still in place to reconcile asset ownership and payment between exchanges, clearing firms, and brokerages.\n\nMost stocks, ETFs, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, listed options, and government securities clear T+1.Spot FX trades typically settle T+2 (T+1 for USD/CAD).Certificates of deposit (CDs) and commercial paper settle T+0.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cNew \u2018T+1\u2019 Settlement Cycle \u2013 What Investors Need To Know: Investor Bulletin.\u201d\n\nNew York Stock Exchange. \"Market Information.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cShortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle.\u201d Pages 45-47, 178-181.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \u201cShortening the Securities Transaction Settlement Cycle.\u201d Pages 21-25.\n\nFINRA. \u201cUnderstanding Settlement Cycles: What Does T+1 Mean for You?\u201d\n\nChicago Mercantile Exchange. \u201cCME Rulebook: Chapter 13 Spot FX Transactions.\u201d Page 5.",
