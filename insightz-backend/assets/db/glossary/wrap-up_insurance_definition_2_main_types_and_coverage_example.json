  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nInvestopedia / Paige McLaughlin\n\nWrap-up insurance is a liability policy that serves as an all-encompassinginsurancethat\u00a0protects all contractors and subcontractors working on\u00a0large projects\u00a0costing over $10 million. The two types of wrap-up insurance are owner-controlled and contractor-controlled.\n\nOwner-controlled insurance\u00a0is set up by the owner of a\u00a0project for the benefit of the builder or contractor to cover all listed contractors.\u00a0The general contractor, meanwhile, may use a contractor-controlled insurance program\u00a0to extend coverage to all the contractors and subcontractors signed up on the project.\n\nThe intent of a wrap-up insurance policy is to provide\u00a0peace of mind that\u00a0everyone involved in a\u00a0project is insured properly. Wrap-up insurance\u00a0is sweepingblanket coveragethat protects the owner, contractors, and subcontractors.Wrap-up insurance is important because it avoids the need for every contractor and subcontractor to obtain their ownliability insurance. If there were several policies, there might be gaps in the coverage or insufficient limits. Instead, wrap-up insurance is more effective at making sure that all of the liability risks are covered adequately.\n\nFor example, consider an\u00a0owner-controlled insurance program purchased by the owner on behalf of the builder or contractor. Counting\u00a0add-ons,\u00a0the insurance\u00a0includes workers' compensation, general liability, excess liability, pollution liability, professional liability, builder's risk,\u00a0and railroad protective liability. While the cost of wrap-up insurance can be expensive, the cost can be\u00a0divided among the general contractors and sub-contractors.\n\nWrap insurance covers a number of risks\u00a0for you, your project, and your workers. Policies can vary, but may include:\n\nThis covers all liabilities\u00a0for a\u00a0project, including bodily injury coverage\u00a0against third-party injuries that occur on the site or if those injuries are the result of work-related activities by the contractor, subcontractor, or owner. Also, it protects third-party property against damage\u00a0caused by anyone covered under the\u00a0policy.\n\nBuilders risk covers for any water, weather, and fire damages to a building under construction. In other words, builders risk is essentially the same asproperty insuranceexcept this covers buildings under construction.\n\nUmbrella insurance provides coverage beyond the coverage limit for a general liability policy.For example, let's say a general liability policy covers up to $2 million in damages and the umbrella liability policy provides $10 million in coverage. If there was a $8 million dollar claim, the general policy would cover first $2 million while the remaining $6 million from the claim would be covered by the umbrella policy.\n\nWorkers' compensationprovides coverage for workers' compensation insurance to all of the enrolled contractors or subcontractors on the project.\n\nCommercial vehicle insurance covers\u00a0cars, vans, trucks, or specialty vehicles used on the construction project against liability claims and property damage.\n\nThis covers\u00a0property damage\u00a0of all the parties named on your policy. Also, equipment floaters for specialized equipment and tools can be added as well as inland marine insurance for tools and equipment that have been transported to and from the job site.\n\nWrap-up insurance policies may have specific exclusions; be aware that any of the items mentioned above may be explicitly disallowed from coverage.\n\nThere are specific steps that often must be taken in sequential order for wrap-up insurance coverage to be secured. First, the development team must examine the project's scope, size, and length to determine whether wrap-up insurance is appropriate. Think about things like the project's type, projected costs, schedule for completion, and any potential risks.\n\nTo discuss the project and the potential inclusion of a wrap-up insurance program, holdpre-bid meetingswith prospective contractors, subcontractors, and insurance providers. This enables stakeholders to know what to expect and what is expected of them right away. This will also flag limitations early in the construction schedule process.\n\nThe project owner often chooses whether to undertake a wrap-up insurance program based on the advice and evaluation given by insurance experts. It is up to the project owner to select an insurance provider or underwriter. The choice is made based on the provider's qualifications, standing, financial stability, scope of coverage, and cost.\n\nThe terms and conditions of wrap-up insurance may be negotiated, though be mindful that underwritten calculations have often been substantiated and approved by the issuing company. You must also be mindful of specific terms such as coverage limits, the length of the insurance, the precise coverages included, thedeductibles, the exclusions, and any further endorsements necessary.\n\nAfter acquiring the wrap-up insurance policy, inform all contractors and subcontractors participating in the project of the coverage. Make sure they are aware of the policy's roles, obligations, and responsibilities. Establish processes for reporting, documenting, and addressing claims as well as ongoing oversight and policy compliance with each impacted party.\n\nWhen development ends, your wrap-up insurance coverage will need to transition to coverage for operations. At this time, coverage will likely move to an individual, as-need basis.\n\nWrap-up insurance has some restrictions. Wrap-up insurance policies are intricate and call for careful planning and coordinating. They require input from the project owner, general contractors, subcontractors, and insurance firms; therefore, coverage requires substantial collaboration as it can be difficult to coordinate coverage, secure suitable restrictions, and manage the different stakeholders.\n\nGiven the size and high value of the projects it covers, wrap-up insurance can be pricey.The premiums, deductibles, and other expenses related to obtaining and managing the insurance, as well as anyadministrative fees, may be substantial. Due due to complexity and uncertainty with long-term projects, the project budget may need to account for these higher expenses.\n\nWrap-up insurance frequently offers protection for particular projects or construction phases but may not cover all facets of a project. A wrap-up policy may not cover some risks such as professional responsibility, design flaws, or pollution liabilities. Project leads must be mindful of these gaps that may call for additional insurance coverage.\n\nOn a related note, wrap-up insurance contracts frequently contain a number of exclusions, limitations, and conditions even in the realms they do cover. For instance, these might restrict coverage for particular types of claims or losses. For example, the Office of General Counsel for New York has set forth restrictions for wrap-up insurance for public development projects.\n\nLast, wrap-up insurance may not always be easily accessible or reasonably priced, depending on the location and nature of the project. Insurance companies may have special requirements or limits before selling them. In addition, the inherent risk of a specific build may be so large that it is cost prohibit or administratively not feasible for any third-party insurer to agree to take on the risk.\n\nOCIP (Owner Controlled Insurance Program) and wrap-up Insurance are both types of insurance policies used in construction projects. The main difference lies in who obtains and controls the insurance coverage. In an OCIP, the project owner purchases and manages the insurance, while with wrap-up coverage, the general contractor or project sponsor obtains and oversees the policy.The coverage provided and the parties covered may vary in each type of insurance.\n\nThe primary benefit of wrap-up insurance coverage is that itconsolidates insurance coverage for all contractors and subcontractorsinvolved in a construction project under a single policy. This streamlines the insurance process, reduces administrative burdens, and can lead to cost savings for project stakeholders.\n\nA wrap-up insurance exclusion refers to specific risks or coverages that are explicitly excluded from the coverage provided by a wrap-up insurance policy. These exclusions outline the risks or situations that are not protected under the policy and may require separate insurance arrangements or endorsements to address those excluded risks.\n\nWrap-up insurance is a comprehensive insurance policy used in construction projects. It provides coverage for all contractors and subcontractors involved in the project under a single policy. It simplifies the insurance process, reduces administrative costs, and offers potentially significant cost savings. The policy typically includes general liability, workers' compensation, and excess liability coverage for the duration of the project.\n\nAmerican Subcontractors Association. \"Wrap-Up Insurance Program Considerations.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). \"Construction Program Guide.\"\n\nSoutheastern Louisiana University. \"Comprehensive General Liability Insurance and Broad-Form Comprehensive General Liability.\"\n\nInsureon. \"Builder's Risk Insurance.\"\n\nGEICO. \"Umbrella Insurance - How it Works & What it Covers.\"\n\nThe Hartford. \"What Does Workers\u2019 Compensation Cover?\"\n\nAllstate. \"Property Damage Liability Coverage \u2014 What Is It?\"\n\nAmerican Family Insurance. \"Construction Wrap-Up Insurance.\"\n\nEmbroker. \"Wrap-Up Insurance Packages.\"\n\nNew York Department of Financial Services. \"Wrap-Up Insurance.\"",
