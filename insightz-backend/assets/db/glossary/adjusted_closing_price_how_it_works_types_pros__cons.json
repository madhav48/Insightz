  "term": "Adjusted Closing Price: How It Works, Types, Pros & Cons",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe adjusted closing price amends a stock'sclosing priceto reflect that stock's value after accounting for any corporate actions. It is often used when examininghistorical returnsor doing a detailed analysis of past performance.\n\nStock values are stated in terms of the closing price and the adjusted closing price. The closing price is the raw price, which is just the cash value of the last transacted price before the market closes. The adjusted closing price factors in anything that mightaffect the stock price after the market closes.\n\nA stock's price is typically affected by the supply and demand of market participants. However, somecorporate actions, such asstock splits,dividends, andrights offerings, affect a stock's price. Adjustments allow investors to obtain an accurate record of the stock's performance. Investors should understand how corporate actions are accounted for in a stock's adjusted closing price. It is especially useful when examining historical returns because it gives analysts an accurate representation of the firm's equity value.\n\nA stock split is a corporate action intended to make the firm\u2019s shares more affordable for average investors. A stock split does not change a company's totalmarket capitalization, but it does affect the company's stock price.\n\nFor example, a company's board of directors may decide to split the company's stock 3-for-1. Therefore, the company's shares outstanding increase by a multiple of three, while its share price is divided by three. Suppose a stock closed at $300 the day before its stock split. In this case, the closing price is adjusted to $100 ($300 divided by 3) per share to maintain a consistent standard of comparison. Similarly, all other previous closing prices for that company would be divided by three to obtain the adjusted closing prices.\n\nCommon distributions that affect a stock's price include cash dividends and stock dividends. The difference between cash dividends and stock dividends is that shareholders are entitled to a predetermined price per share and additional shares, respectively.\n\nFor example, assume a company declared a $1 cash dividend and was trading at $51 per share before then. All other things being equal, the stock price would fall to $50 because that $1 per share is no longer part of the company's assets. However, the dividends are still part of the investor's returns. By subtracting dividends from previous stock prices, we obtain the adjusted closing prices and a better picture of returns.\n\nA stock's adjusted closing price also reflects rights offerings that may occur. A rights offering is an issue of rights given to existing shareholders, which entitles the shareholders to subscribe to the rights issue in proportion to their shares. That will lower the value of existing shares because supply increases have adilutiveeffect on the existing shares.\n\nFor example, assume a company declares a rights offering, in which existingshareholdersare entitled to one additional share for every two shares owned. Assume the stock is trading at $50, and existing shareholders can purchase additional shares at a subscription price of $45. After the rights offering, the adjusted closing price is calculated based on the adjusting factor and the closing price.\n\nThe main advantage of adjusted closing prices is that they make it easier to evaluate stock performance. Firstly, the adjusted closing price helps investors understand how much they would have made by investing in a given asset. Most obviously, a 2-for-1 stock split does not cause investors to lose half their money. Since successful stocks often split repeatedly, graphs of their performance would be hard to interpret without adjusted closing prices.\n\nSecondly, the adjusted closing price allows investors to compare the performance of two or more assets. Aside from the clear issues with stock splits, failing to account for dividends tends to understate the profitability ofvalue stocksanddividend growthstocks. Using the adjusted closing price is also essential when comparing the returns of differentasset classesover the long term. For example, the prices ofhigh-yield bondstend to fall in the long run. That does not mean these bonds are necessarily poor investments. Their high yields offset the losses and more, which can be seen by looking at the adjusted closing prices of high-yield bond funds.\n\nThe adjusted closing price provides the most accurate record of returns for long-term investors looking to designasset allocations.\n\nThenominalclosing price of a stock or other asset can convey useful information. This information is destroyed by converting that price into an adjusted closing price. In actual practice, manyspeculatorsplace buy and sell orders at certain prices, such as $100. As a result, a sort of tug of war can take place betweenbullsandbearsat these key prices. If the bulls win, abreakoutmay occur and send the asset price soaring. Similarly, a win for the bears can lead to abreakdownand further losses. The adjusted close stock price obscures these events.\n\nBy looking at the actual closing price at the time, investors can get a better idea of what was going on and understand contemporary accounts. If investors look at historical records, they will find many examples of tremendous public interest in nominal levels. Perhaps the most famous is the role that Dow 1,000 played in the 1966 to 1982secular bear market. During that period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) repeatedly hit 1,000, only to fall back shortly after that. The breakout finally took place in 1982, and the Dow never dropped below 1,000 again.\ufeff\ufeff This phenomenon is covered up somewhat by adding dividends to obtain the adjusted closing prices.\n\nIn general, adjusted closing prices are less useful for more speculative stocks.Jesse Livermoreprovided an excellent account of the impact of key nominal prices, such as $100 and $300, on Anaconda Copper in the early 20th century. In the early 21st century, similar patterns occurred with Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla (TSLA).William J. O'Neilgave examples where stock splits, far from being irrelevant, marked the beginnings of real declines in the stock price.\ufeff\ufeff While arguably irrational, the impact of nominal prices on stocks could be an example of aself-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Dow Jones Industrial Average.\" Download required.
