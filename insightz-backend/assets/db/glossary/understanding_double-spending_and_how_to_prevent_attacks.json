  "term": "Understanding Double-Spending and How to Prevent Attacks",
  "definition": "Double-spending is spending the same cryptocurrency or blockchain token more than once. Cryptocurrency is a token that represents value on a distributed ledger, so without proper mechanisms in place it, would be easy to change a ledger entry and give yourself back the amount you had spent.\n\nDouble-spending is not limited only to cryptocurrency; it is a problem in all blockchain designs. Here's more about this issue, how it's done, and some steps to take to keep from being a victim.\n\nCryptocurrencies andblockchainhad been under development for many years before Bitcoin was introduced. One of the many reasons they didn't work until Bitcoin was that an issue needed to be resolved\u2014one where a user could alter the information on a distributed ledger to give themselves back any tokens they had spent.\n\nThis is a weakness in anydigital moneysystem, which is why third-party auditors have traditionally been involved. These auditors must spend time, which equates to money, verifying transactions and amounts between parties. For this system to work, there must be trust between all parties involved that the auditors, ledger maintainers, or other parties would not alter entries to benefit themselves or others.\n\nThe solution presented bySatoshi Nakamoto, which involved timestamping transactions and chaining them together using cryptographic techniques, solved the double-spending problem. However, for this solution to work, a large and fast distributed network is needed to keep ill-intentioned actors from altering the transactions. Popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum are large enough to prevent double-spending attacks against the network, but individuals should still be cautious.\n\nPeople who use or invest in cryptocurrency should ensure that they do not accept unconfirmed transactions. Due to awareness of these attempts, many wallet creators program wallets that do not allow unconfirmed transactions to be accepted. However, it's best to check and make sure yourwalletdisplays this information or prevents you from accepting one.\n\nThe most significant double-spending risk for blockchains is a51% attack, which can occur if an entity controls more than 50% of the hashing power or validation mechanisms on a network.\n\nIf this user\u2014or users\u2014assumes a majority of the network, the network's stake, or any other mechanism used, they will be able to dictate transaction consensus and control the award of currency. New or forked cryptocurrencies with smaller networks are susceptible to this attack. In cryptocurrency networks such as Bitcoin, this is very unlikely due to the number of network participants and the speed at which the network operates.\n\nEthereum uses astaking mechanic, where only those users who have locked large amounts of ether in smart contracts can become validators and propose blocks. To attempt this attack, a group or entity would need to control more than 50% of the staked ether on the network\u2014a very costly effort because 32 ETH (about $95,200 at the May 15, 2024 price) is required to establish a node, and there is also a mechanism that burns the tokens of dishonest validators.\n\nRace attacks, also called unconfirmed transaction, are where a malicious user attempts to send two quick transactions, one to a recipient and one to the blockchain. The one to a recipient might transfer a token to them, but the transaction sent to the network would keep it in the sender's possession. This is an attempt to exploit network lag, with the sender's transaction establishing ownership being confirmed first.\n\nThis is easily prevented by not accepting unconfirmed transactions.\n\nA finney attack, named after Hal Finney, the developer who pointed out the weakness, is a type of unconfirmed transaction attack. However, this attack requires a miner, who creates a block and sends an amount to two addresses they own. Another transaction is sent to another party in the same block. If the recipient accepts it before it is confirmed by the network, the sender can essentially return the amount sent and spend it again.\n\nThis attack is very rare on large blockchains but can be prevented by not accepting unconfirmed transactions or using a wallet that doesn't let you accept them.\n\nA Sybil attack is when multiple nodes are created in an attempt to gain influence over a network. This sounds like a 51% attack, but it is at a lower scale. Sybil attacks can be viewed as precursors to 51% attacks.\n\nWhether double-spending is illegal depends on the circumstances. With regards to a cryptocurrency with a market value, it is illegal because it is committing fraud.\n\nHowever, double spending is not limited to cryptocurrency. For example, imagine a gaming community has created a blockchain to facilitate its voting processes, where one blockchain token represents one vote. The token has no monetary value and is not a cryptocurrency.\n\nThe gamers want to hold an event but are divided on where to do it. A vote seems the best way to resolve the division, so they vote. If someone initiated a double-spend attack and changed peoples' votes, those members' tokens would be spent twice, and the result wouldn't be representative of the true outcome of the vote. This is generally not illegal, but it is unethical within the gaming community and might violate their conditions of membership.\n\nDouble spending is the act of using the same digital currency or token more than once.\n\nDouble spending is altering a transaction on a blockchain or distributed ledger so that a spent token can be spent again.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin solution was to use an encryption algorithm, distributed consensus, proof that work was done to validate transactions, and timestamps on a large, fast network.\n\nA double-spending attack is an alteration in a blockchain's operation that allows the attacker to use a token more than once. It is most often thought to be a cryptocurrency problem, but it can happen on blockchains and distributed ledgers.\n\nUsers can prevent a double-spend attack by not accepting unconfirmed transactions. Smaller networks are prone to double-spending attacks, so it's best to use cryptocurrencies and blockchains with larger networks.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
