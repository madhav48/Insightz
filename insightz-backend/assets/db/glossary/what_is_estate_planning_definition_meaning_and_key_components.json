  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nEstate planning refers to the preparation of tasks that manage an individual's financial situation in the event of their incapacitation or death. This planning includes the bequest of assets to heirs and the settlement ofestate taxesand debts, along with other considerations like the guardianship of minor children and pets.\n\nMost estate plans are set up with thehelp of an attorneyexperienced in estate law. Some of the steps include listing assets and debts, reviewing accounts, and writing a will.\n\nEstate planning involves determininghow an individual\u2019s assets will be preserved, managed, and distributed after death. It also takes into account the management of an individual\u2019s properties and financial obligations in the event that they become incapacitated. Assets that could make up an estate include houses, vehicles, stocks, art, collectibles, life insurance, pensions, debt, and more.\n\nContrary to what you might think, this isn't a tool meant just for the ultra-wealthy. Anyone can\u2014and should\u2014consider estate planning. There are various reasons why you might begin estate planning, such aspreserving family wealth, providing for a surviving spouse and children, funding children's or grandchildren\u2019s education, and leaving your legacy for a charitable cause.\n\nWriting a will is one of the most important steps. But there's so much more to do. Other major estate planning tasks include the following:\n\nThe following table serves as achecklistwhen it comes to planning your estate:\n\nA will is a legal document that provides instructions about how an individual\u2019s property and custody of minor children (if any) should be handled after death. The individual expresses their wishes and names a trustee or executor whom they trust to fulfill their stated intentions.\n\nThe will also indicates whether a trust should be created after death. Depending on the estate owner\u2019s intentions, a trust can go into effect during their lifetime through aliving trustor with atestamentary trustafter their death.\n\nThe authenticity of a will is determined through a legal process known asprobate. Probate is the first step taken in administering the estate of a deceased person and distributing assets to the beneficiaries. When an individual dies, the custodian of the will must take the will to the probate court or to the executor named in the will, typically within 10 to 30 days of the death of the individual (who is also called a testator).\n\nThe probate process is a court-supervised procedure in which the authenticity of the will left behind is proved to be valid and accepted as the true last testament of the deceased. The court officially appoints the executor named in the will, which, in turn, gives the executor the legal power to act on behalf of the deceased.\n\nEstate planning is an action plan you can use to determine what happens to your assets and obligations while you're alive and after you die.\n\nA will, on the other hand, is a legal document that outlines how assets are distributed, who takes care of children and pets, and any other wishes after you die.\n\nThe legal personal representative or executor approved by the court is responsible for resolving the financial affairs of the deceased, including locating and overseeing all assets.\n\nThe executor has to estimate the value of the estate by using either the date of death value or the alternative valuation date, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).\n\nAssets that need to be assessed during probate include:\n\nMost assets that are subject to probate administration come under the supervision of the probate court in the place where the decedent lived at death. The exception is real estate, which may need to be probated in the county in which it is located.\n\nThe executor also has to pay off any taxes and debts owed by the deceased from the estate. Creditors usually have a limited amount of time from the date they were notified of the testator\u2019s death to make claims against the estate for money owed to them.\n\nClaims that are rejected by the executor can be taken to court, where a probate judge will have the final say as to whether or not the claim is valid.\n\nThe executor is also responsible for filing the final personal income tax returns on behalf of the deceased. After the inventory of the estate has been taken, the value of assets calculated, and taxes and debt paid off, the executor will then seek authorization from the court to distribute whatever is left of the estate to the beneficiaries.\n\nAny estate taxes that are pending will come due within nine months of the date of death.\n\nFederal and state taxes applied to an estate can reduce its value considerably before assets are distributed to beneficiaries.\n\nDeath can result in large liabilities for the family, necessitating generational transfer strategies that can reduce, eliminate, or postpone tax payments. There are significant steps in the estate planning process that individuals and married couples can take toreduce the impact of these taxes.\n\nMarried couples, for example, can set up an A-B trust that divides into two after the death of the first spouse. Trust A is the survivor's trust while trust B becomes the decedent's trust, typically for the beneficiaries, such as the couple's children.\n\nEach individual places their assets in the trust and names someone other than their spouse as the beneficiary. However,A-B trusts have become less popularas the estate tax exemption works well for most estates.\n\nGrandparents may transfer assets to an entity, such as a529 plan, to support grandchildren's education.\n\nThat may be a more tax-efficient move than having those assets transferred after death to fund college or other schooling when the beneficiaries are of age. The latter may trigger multiple tax events that can limit the amount of funding available to grandchildren.\n\nAnother strategy an estate planner can take to minimize the estate\u2019s tax liability after death is giving to charitable organizations while alive. The gifts reduce the financial size of the estate since they are excluded from the taxable estate, thus lowering the estate tax bill.\n\nAs a result, the individual has a lower effective cost of giving, which provides additional incentive to make those gifts. Estate planners can work with the donor in order to reduce taxable income as a result of those contributions or formulate strategies that maximize the effect of those donations.\n\nThis is another strategy that can be used to limitdeath taxes. It involves an individual locking in the current value, and thus tax liability, of their property, while attributing the value of future growth of that capital to another person. Any increase that occurs in the value of the assets in the future is transferred to the benefit of another person, such as a spouse, child, or grandchild.\n\nThis method involves freezing the value of an asset at its value on the date of transfer. Accordingly, the amount of potential capital gain at death is also frozen, allowing the estate planner to estimate their potential tax liability upon death and better plan for the payment of income taxes.\n\nLife insurance serves as a source to pay death taxes and expenses, fundbusiness buy-sell agreements, and fund retirement plans.\n\nIf sufficient insurance proceeds are available and the policies are properly structured, any income tax on the deemeddispositions of assetsfollowing the death of an individual can be paid without resorting to the sale of assets. Proceeds from life insurance that are received by the beneficiaries upon the death of the insured are generally income tax-free.\n\nEstate planning is a broad term that is used to describe the process that individuals go through to plan the administration of their assets and liabilities before and after they die. This process also includes writing a will, reviewing accounts and assets, creating joint accounts, preparing other legal documents, and appointing an executor, among other things.\n\nEstate planning costs vary based on the steps you take and how you undergo the process. For instance, using an estate planner or lawyer may require you to pay an hourly fee for their services. Keep in mind that you may be able to secure a flat fee for services rendered. Other fees associated with estate planning include the preparation of a will, which can be as low as a few hundred dollars if you use one of thebest online will makers.\n\nThere are certain documents you'll need as part of the estate planning process. Some of the most common ones include wills, powers of attorney (POAs), guardianship designations, and living wills. Other paperwork you'll need and will find useful includes bank account statements, full lists of your holdings (assets and liabilities), and beneficiary designations.\n\nThere is a myth that estate planning is only for high-net-worth individuals. But that's not true. In fact, estate planning is a tool that everyone can use. Estate planning makes it easier for individuals to determine their wishes before and after they die.\n\nContrary to what most people believe, it extends beyond what to do with assets and liabilities. In fact, estate planning can also answer questions about the guardianship of minor children and pets, what to do when it comes time for your funeral, and what charities you want to support after you die.\n\nYou should start planning for your estate as soon as you have any measurable asset base. It's an ongoing process: as life progresses, your estate plan should shift to match your circumstances, in line with your new goals. And keep at it. Not doing your estate planning can cause undue financial burdens to loved ones. (Estate taxes can run as high as 40%.) So, at the very least, set up a will\u2014even if the taxable estate is not large.\n\nEstate planning is often thought of as a tool for the wealthy. But that isn't the case. It can be a useful way for you to deal with your assets and liabilities before and after you die. Estate planning is also a great way for you to lay out plans for the care of your minor children and pets and to outline your wishes for your funeral and favorite charities.\n\nBut don't confuse writing a will with estate planning\u2014the former is just one of the steps you'll need to take in the estate planning process. While you're at it, make sure you appoint a responsible executor and review your accounts on a regular basis to ensure you're getting the most bang for your buck.\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Revocable Trusts.\"\n\nJustia. \"An Executor's Legal Duties.\"\n\nAmerican College of Trust and Estate Counsel. \"What Is Probate?\"\n\nOhio State Bar Association. \"Law Facts: Administering an Estate Without a Will.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Introduction to Wills.\"\n\nWashington State Department of Revenue. \"Estate Tax Alternate Valuation.\"\n\nGovernment Printing Office. \"Title 26: Internal Revenue Code: Sec. 2032.
