  "term": "What Is Green Marketing? Definition, Example and How It Works",
  "definition": "Green marketing refers to the practice of developing and advertising products based on their real or perceived environmental sustainability.\n\nExamples of green marketing include advertising the reduced emissions associated with a product\u2019s manufacturing process, or the use of post-consumer recycled materials for a product's packaging. Some companies also may market themselves as being environmentally-conscious companies bydonatinga portion of their sales proceeds to environmental initiatives, such as tree planting.\n\nGreen marketing is one component of a broader movement toward socially and environmentally conscious business practices. Increasingly, consumers have come to expect companies to demonstrate their commitment to improving their operations alongside variousenvironmental, social, and governance (ESG)criteria. To that end, many companies will distributesocial impact statementson an ongoing basis, in which they periodically self-report their progress toward these goals.\n\nTypical examples of ESG-related improvements include the reduction of carbon emissions involved in a company\u2019s operations, the maintenance of high labor standards both domestically and throughout internationalsupply chains, and philanthropic programs designed to support the communities in which the company operates. Although green marketing refers specifically to environmental initiatives, these efforts are increasingly presented alongside social and corporate governance policies as well.\n\nWhen a company\u2019s green marketing activities are not substantiated by significant investments or operational changes, it may be criticized for false or misleading advertising. This practice is also sometimes referred to asgreenwashing, and the fines and negative press can be tremendous. For example, on April 8, 2022, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made a public announcement that it was issuing a $5.5 million penalty via its Penalty Offense Authority to Kohl's Inc. ($2.5 million) and Walmart, Inc. ($3 million) due to their deceptive environmental claims about rayon products. This is the largest civil penalty in FTC history.\n\nThere are many incentives for companies that choose to engage in green marketing. To begin with, a companies\u2019 perceived commitment to environmental causes is an increasingly important factor influencing many consumers' spending habits.\n\nStarbucks is often cited as a leader in green marketing practices. The company has invested heavily in various social and environmental initiatives in recent years. For example, in a 2018 report, Starbucks reported that it had committed over $140 million to the development ofrenewable energy sources.The company purchases enough renewable energy to power all of its company-operated stores throughout North America and the United Kingdom.\n\nSimilarly, the company has made investments in social impact projects through initiatives such as the Starbucks College Achievement Plan. Through this project, many U.S.-based Starbucks employees who work more than 20 hours a week on average are eligible to receive fully-paidtuitionto the online undergraduate degree program offered by Arizona State University.This project, as well as similar commitments in areas related to the employment of veterans, have formed an important part of Starbucks\u2019 green marketing initiatives.\n\nFrom an investor's point of view, these kinds of green marketing initiatives can prove essential in building and maintaining a valuable brand, particularly for consumer-facing companies such as Starbucks. However, some critics argue that green marketing can exacerbate the existing advantages of larger companies at the expense of their small or mid-sized competitors.\n\nAfter all, implementing robust social or environmental programs often involves additionaloverhead costs. For large companies, these costs can easily be borne and may even form part of the company\u2019s existing marketing budget. For smaller companies, however, the addition of these costs may significantly impair the profitability or viability of the business.\n\nGreenwashing is when a company makes claims about its positive environmental endeavors but is misleading the public about them, or outright lying. If a company's green marketing activities are found to be false, the company may be hit with heavy penalties and bad press.\n\nStarbucks, Patagonia, and Burts Bees are all active in green marketing due to the high level of positive ecological and social programs that these companies support.\n\nGreen marketing focuses on myriad environmentally friendly policies and initiatives that illuminate products and services that are more beneficial (or at least less harmful) to the environment than other products.\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"FTC Uses Penalty Offense Authority to Seek Largest-Ever Civil Penalty for Bogus Bamboo Marketing from Kohl\u2019s and Walmart.\"\n\nStarbucks. \"This Store Is Powered by Sunshine\u2019: Solar and Wind Power Fuel Starbucks Stores.\"\n\nStarbucks. \"Starbucks 2019: Global Social Impact Report,\" Page 7.\n\nStarbucks. \"Education: Careers, Future Leaders Start Here.\"",
