  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\n\"The Greatest Generation\" is a term used to describe those Americans who grew up during theGreat Depressionand fought in World War II, or whose labor helped win it.\n\nIt is thought to have been coined by former NBC Nightly News anchor and author Tom Brokaw in his book of the same name.\n\nThe Greatest Generation is also known as the \"G.I. Generation\" or the \"WWII Generation.\"\n\nThere are no precise dates that define when members of the Greatest Generation were born, though the early 1900s to the mid-1920s is often seen.\n\nThe common characteristic of Greatest Generation members is that they lived through the hardships of the Great Depression and later either fought in World War II or worked in the industries that contributed to winning the war.\n\nNewsman Tom Brokaw is often credited with popularizing the term through his book \"The Greatest Generation,\"which profiled people who came of age during World War II.\n\nIt was inspired by Brokaw's attendance at the 40th-anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion of mainland Europe.\n\nBrokaw's profiles focused on the soldiers who fought the war, as well as the workers whose labor provided the essential material and services in support of them.\n\nThe youngest members of the Greatest Generation, if using 1924 as the last year they were born, hit 100 years of age in 2024. Around 101,000 centenarians were living in the United States in 2024.\n\nAs for WWII veterans, there were only about 66,000 left in the U.S. as of early 2025.\n\nIn 2023, the Department of Veterans Affairs estimated that around 130 Greatest Generation veterans were thought to be lost every day.\n\nAccording to research by theWashington Post, the final member of the Greatest Generation should die around the year 2046 if they can reach age 120 given advances in health care and improvements in life expectancy.\n\nSome well-known members of the Greatest Generation include President John F. Kennedy, Queen Elizabeth II, Jesse Owens, Alan Turing, Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Pope John Paul II, and Malcolm X.\n\nWhile every individual is unique, demographers and sociologists have identified some common characteristics that oftenvary from generation to generation.\n\nAmong the Greatest Generation, individuals tend to have the following characteristics:\n\nMany of these are thought to stem from living through World War I (if born early enough) and the Great Depression as children, and then fighting in or living through World War II after that.\n\nGenerally speaking, the Greatest Generation are the parents of the \"baby boomers\" and are the children of the \"Lost Generation\" (those who grew up or came of age during World War I).\n\nThey preceded what is known as the \"Silent Generation,\" a cohort born between the mid-1920s and the early-to-mid 1940s. Broadly speaking, the grandchildren of the Greatest Generation are members ofGeneration X, and their great-grandchildren tend to bemillennialsand Gen Zers.\n\nMembers of the Greatest Generation now fall into the \"retirees\" demographic and are collectingSocial Security benefits.\n\nThe differences between generations have been studied extensively. Socio-economic models have been created to help plan for future government expenditures and programs to address changes in existing demographics.\n\n\"The Greatest Generation\" is a term popularized by former NBC Nightly News anchor and author Tom Brokaw in his book of the same name. It was meant as a tribute to the resilience and patriotic spirit of those who lived through the Great Depression and then fought in World War II.\n\nThe youngest members of the Greatest Generation, if using 1925 as the last year they were born, would be reaching their 100s in the year 2025. As of 2024, there were estimated to be around 101,000 centenarians living in the United States.\n\nThe Greatest Generation refers to those Americans born from 1900 through 1925, many of whom fought during World War II.\n\nDepending on their age, some members of this generation grew up during WWI, lived through the Great Depression and are or were the parents of the baby boomer generation.\n\nThey are characterized as being very patriotic, committed to work, family, and frugal lifestyles, and being motivated to work hard to succeed.\n\nThe term itself came from a book by newsman Tom Brokaw, entitled \"The Greatest Generation,\"which was first published in 1998.\n\nBritannica. \"Greatest Generation.\"\n\nThe Normandy Institute. \u201cTom Brokaw \u2013 Greatest Generation \u2013 Legion of Honor.\u201d\n\nCNBC. \"By 2054, There Will Be 422,000 Americans Over Age 100.
