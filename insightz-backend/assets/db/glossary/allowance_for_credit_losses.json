  "term": "Allowance For Credit Losses",
  "definition": "Allowance for credit losses is an estimate\u00a0of thedebtthat a company is unlikely to recover.\u00a0It is taken from the perspective of the selling company that extendscreditto its buyers.\n\nMost businesses conduct transactions with each other on credit, meaning they do not have to pay cash at the time purchases from another entity is made. The credit results in anaccounts receivableon thebalance sheetof the selling company. Accounts receivable is recorded as acurrent assetand describes the amount that is due for providing services or goods.\n\nOne of the main risks of selling goods on credit is that not all payments are guaranteed to be collected. To factor in this possibility, companies create an allowance for credit losses entry.\n\nSince current assets by definition are expected to turn to cash within one year, a company's balance sheet could overstate its accounts receivable and, therefore, itsworking capitalandshareholders' equityif any part of its accounts receivable is not collectible.\n\nThe allowance for credit losses is an accounting technique that enables companies to take these anticipated losses into consideration in itsfinancial statementsto limit overstatement of potential income. To avoid an account overstatement, a company will estimate how much of its receivables it expects will be delinquent.\n\nSince a certain amount of credit losses can be anticipated, these expected losses are included in a balance sheetcontra asset account. The line item can be called allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncollectible accounts, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for losses on customer financing receivables\u00a0or provision for doubtful accounts.\n\nAny increase to allowance for credit losses is also recorded in theincome statementasbad debt expenses. Companies may have abad debt reserveto offset credit losses.\n\nA company can use statistical modeling such asdefault probabilityto determine its expected losses to delinquent and bad debt. The statistical calculations can utilize historical data from the business as well as from the industry as a whole.\n\nCompanies regularly make changes to the allowance for credit losses entry to correlate with the current statistical modeling allowances. When accounting for allowance for credit losses, a company does not need to know specifically which customer will not pay, nor does it need to know the exact amount. An approximate amount that is uncollectible can be used.\n\nIn its10-Kfiling covering the 2018fiscal year, Boeing Co. (BA) explained how it calculates its allowance for credit losses. The manufacturer of airplanes, rotorcraft, rockets, satellites, and missiles said it reviews customercredit ratings, published historical creditdefault ratesfor different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications every quarter to determine which customers might not pay up what they owe.\n\nThe company also disclosed that there are no guarantees that its estimates will be correct, adding that actual losses on receivables could easily be higher or lower than forecast. In 2018, Boeing\u2019s allowance as a percentage of gross customer financing was 0.31%.\n\nSay a company has $40,000 worth of accounts receivable on September 30. It estimates 10% of its accounts receivable will be uncollected\u00a0and proceeds to create a credit entry of 10% x $40,000 = $4,000 in allowance for credit losses. In order to adjust this balance, a debit entry will be made in the bad debts expense for $4,000.\n\nEven though the accounts receivable is not due in September, the company still has to report credit losses of $4,000 as bad debts expense in its income statement for the month. If accounts receivable is $40,000 and allowance for credit losses is $4,000, the net amount reported on the balance sheet will be $36,000.\n\nThis same process is used by banks to report uncollectible payments from borrowers who default on their loan payments.",
