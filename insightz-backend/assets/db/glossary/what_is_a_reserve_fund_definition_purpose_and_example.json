  "term": "What Is a Reserve Fund? Definition, Purpose, and Example",
  "definition": "A reserve fund is a savings account or other highlyliquid assetset aside by an individual or business to meet\u00a0any future costs or financial obligations, especially those arising unexpectedly. If the fund is set up to meet the costs of scheduled upgrades, less liquid assets may be used. For example, ahomeowner's\u00a0associationoften manages a reserve fund to help maintain the community\u00a0and its amenities using the dues paid by homeowners.\n\nA reserve fund sets aside money for covering scheduled, routine and unscheduled expenses that would otherwise be drawn from a general fund. Governments, financial institutions, and private households may establish reserve funds.\n\nAlthough the fund size may vary, the typical goal is to deposit funds regularly in an account that accrues interest, thereby\u00a0increasing\u00a0the fund's value while not in use. Because expenses may arise unexpectedly, a reserve fund is typically kept in a highly liquid account, such as asavings account.\n\nIn pension funds, for example, money is invested on behalf of a fund's members and later paid out during retirement. When working employees sign up for a\u00a0pension fund, they put money into a reserve fund that is used to ensure money is available for other\u00a0employees who signed up to receive a payout when they retire.\n\nHomeowners' associations and condominiums often use reserve funds in the event of large-scale maintenance or renovation projects, as well as for any costly community emergencies. Reserve funds are typically managed in tandem with operating funds, which more commonly fund the community's day-to-day expenses or recurring costs, such as housekeeping, taxes, insurance, and utilities.\n\nCondo communities and HOAs\u00a0typically establish and maintain the funds using the dues, orHOA fees, paid by owners to\u00a0cover maintenance, repairs, and other expenses incurred by the community. The community association's board usually oversees the funds and decides how to allocate its use. For example, rather than tapping into the operating fund, the board may use part of the reserve fund money to cover biannual insurance payments.\n\nIf a condominium incurs a large expense that the reserve fund cannot cover, each member or owner may pay\u00a0anassessmentto cover the cost. For example, when a condominium's parking garage needs emergency repairs, unit owners may be asked for additional funds beyond their regular association dues.\n\nThe best way to avoid\u00a0a special assessment is to ensure the building\u2019s reserve fund is well-equipped with enough money to handle expenses, including those that are unexpected. Often, HOA boards\u00a0determine how much money should go into their reserve fund supply via\u00a0a reserve study, where independent consultants assess the state of a\u00a0property and make recommendations for the reserve fund based on\u00a0physical and financial analysis.\n\nThe experts consider the age of the property, its current state, and the amenities it provides, as well as project maintenance costs that may be needed in the future. Because condominiums or HOAs\u00a0do not always fully fund their reserves, the final figure determined by a reserve study is only a recommendation.\n\nThe implications of a poorly managed reserve fund can translate to higher dues or assessments for members of a community association; so, potential buyers should investigate the efficacy of a particular HOA, or condominium community, before purchasing a home under its jurisdiction.",
