  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nA proxy fight refers to the act of a group of shareholders joining forces and attempting to gather enough shareholder proxy votes to win a corporate vote. Sometimes referred to as a \"proxy battle,\u201d this action is mainly used in corporate takeovers.\n\nIn the process of a corporate takeover\u2013particularly ahostile takeover\u2013outside acquirers may attempt to convince existing shareholders to vote out some (or all) of a company\u2019s senior management to make it easier to seize control over the organization.\n\nShareholders may appeal to a company\u2019s board of directors if they\u2019re dissatisfied with a specific management decision. But if board members refuse to listen, disgruntled shareholders may\u00a0attempt to persuade other shareholders to let them use theirproxy votesin a campaign to replace unyielding board members with candidates more receptive to implementing the shareholders' proposed changes.\n\nIn this scenario, the acquirer and the target company typically use various solicitation methods to influence shareholder votes for replacement board members. Shareholders may be sent a Form DEF 14A\u2013also called aproxy statement\u2013which contains financial information and other data on the target company. If the proxy fight involves the sale of the company, the proxy statement will also include a more granular version of the proposed acquisition.\n\nThe acquiring company usually contacts shareholders through a third-party proxy solicitor, who compiles a list of stakeholders. In a further attempt to influence their voting positions, the proxy solicitor may reach out to each stakeholder individually and state the acquirer's case. If shares are registered in the names of stock brokerage firms, proxy solicitors consult with shareholders of that firm in order to influence their voting positions.\n\nIn either case, individual shareholders or stock brokerages then submit their votes to a designated entity, such as astock transfer agent, who aggregates the information. In most cases, proxy solicitors may scrutinize or challenge unclear votes, and they may flag situations where shareholders voted multiple times or neglected to sign their votes.\n\nThe acquiring\u00a0company\u00a0then forwards the results to the target company's corporate secretary\u00a0before the shareholders' meeting. Finally, prospective board members are approved or rejected based on the final vote count.\n\nSometimesshareholdersare uninterested or apathetic about reviewing options for new senior management positions, and it can be difficult to arouse their interest in these matters. Shareholders often absently go along with the recommendations mailed to them, without examining the potential director's qualifications or the takeover's key underlying issues.\n\nWhile the same level of disinterest often applies to acquisition votes, a proxy fight may favor the acquirer, if the target company\u2019s poor financial results negatively impact shareholders\u2014especially if the acquirer has strong ideas for making the company profitable to shareholders. For example, the acquirer may propose selling off some of the business\u2019 underperforming assets or increasing stock dividends.\n\nIn February 2008, Microsoft Corporation made anunsolicited offer to buy Yahoo for $31 per share.\u00a0The board of directors at Yahoo believed the offer by Microsoft under-valued the company, and, consequently, the board stalled any negotiations between Microsoft and Yahoo executives.\n\nOn May 3, 2008, Microsoft withdrew its offer, and less than two weeks later, billionaire Carl Icahn launched an effort to replace Yahoo\u2019s board of directors through a proxy contest.",
