  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA last will and testament is a legal document that communicates a person's final wishes pertaining to theirassets. It provides specific instructions about what to do with their possessions. It will indicate whether the deceased leaves them to another person, a group, or wishes todonate\u00a0them to charity.\n\nAlast will and testamentcan also handle matters involving dependents, the management of accounts, and financial\u00a0interests.\n\nSome states allow for non-standard or unusual wills, such as aholographic will, while others do not.\n\nA will and last testament directs thedispositionof your assets, such as bank balances, property, or prized possessions. It will detail who is to receive property and in what amount. It can establish guardian arrangements for survivingdependents.\n\nIf you have a business or investments, your will can specify who will receive those assets and when. A will also allows you to direct assets to a charity (or charities), or to an institution or an organization.\n\nA person writes a will while living. Its instructions are only carried out once the individual dies. A will names anexecutorof the will. That person is responsible for administering the estate. Aprobate courtusually supervises the executor to ensure that the wishes specified in the will are carried out.\n\nA will and last testament can form thefoundation of an estate planand is the key instrument used to ensure that the estate is settled in the manner desired by the deceased.\n\nWhile there can be more to an estate plan than just a will, the will is the presiding document that aprobatecourt\u00a0uses to guide the settling of an estate.\n\nAny assets that havedesignated beneficiaries, such as alife insurancepolicy,qualified retirement plan, orbrokerage account, are not included as probate assets and pass directly to the beneficiaries.\n\nWhile many people obtain assistance with their wills from a lawyer, this is not necessary to make most wills legal and binding.\n\nThere are several situations after death for which a will isn't useful.\n\nWhile some wills do avoid probate, property that your will directs should go to certain beneficiaries (whether people or organizations) may still betied up in probate court for months before it can be distributedaccording to your wishes.\n\nIn addition to time and effort, the probate process involves legal fees relating to a lawyer, the executor, and the court.\n\nA will shouldn't contain directions for funeral arrangements. That's because, normally, it won't be reviewed for some time after death. Be sure to leave instructions for funeral arrangements in a separate document that's easily accessed by the executor or a family member.\n\nGifts that you bestow through a will can't come with certain conditions attached. For instance, they can't be contingent on the marriage of a recipient, the divorce, or their religion. However, some conditions may be permitted.\n\nA will doesn't allow you to reduce or avoidtaxes that will be owed on your estate.\n\nPets can't own property, so if your dog, cat or other pet is important to you, you can consider leaving them to a trusted individual who will provide them with a loving home or find one for them. Your will can provide that person with money to help them care for your pet(s).\n\nTo provide long-term care for a loved one with special needs, it's best to set up aspecial needs trust. The trust can direct the care and provide ongoing income, without affecting the benefits they can also receive through government programs.\n\nAddenda to the will, such as apower of attorneyor amedical directive, can direct the court on how to handle matters if a person becomes physically or mentally incapacitated.\n\nA valid will requires that you be over the age of majority, understand what property you have, and what it means to leave property to others after your death.\n\nA will requires you to identify the assets and property that are to be bequeathed as well as the identities of the intended recipients (known asnamed beneficiaries).\n\nA will shoulddesignate an executorto carry out the will's instructions according to the wishes of the deceased.\n\nFor a will to be considered valid, it must be signed. Many jurisdictions also require that the signing of a will be witnessed by at least two unrelated individuals, age 18 or over.Check your state laws for this information.\n\nThe four main types of wills are the simple will, the joint will, the testamentary trust will, and the living will.\n\nUse a simple will to list your assets and the beneficiaries who should receive them. You can also designate the executor and a guardian for any minor children.\n\nA simple will is one that can be done easily online using one of various templates. Be sure to get any legal advice you feel you need.\n\nA joint will is one document that involves two people, generally spouses.\u00a0When one dies, the will is executed in favor of the other spouse, as defined in the will. The provisions can't be changed by the surviving spouse, which can be a problem if that spouse's circumstances change.\n\nJoint wills aren't as common as they once were because of this inflexibility.\n\nThis will contains one or more testamentary trusts that take effect after your death and the probate process (unlike, for example, a living trust which takes effect during your lifetime). It is used in instances where beneficiaries, such as minor children and/or those with special needs, need specific care over a long period of time. The trust distributes all or a portion of your assets after you pass.\n\nThis type of will only concerns your medical care and decision-making should you become incapacitated. It is a legal document that provides instructions for your care and, among other things, the termination of medical support.\n\nIt does not deal with a distribution of your property to beneficiaries or other such final wishes.\n\nYou don't need a lawyer to create a legally recognized and accepted living will. In fact, medical facilities or your state government can provide living will forms to you. Each state has specific legal requirements for valid living wills. Be sure that you understand them before creating one.\n\nWills and trusts are both important estate-planning tools, but they differ in important ways.Trustsare legal entities created by individuals known asgrantors(also known as trustors orsettlors) that are assigned assets and instruct in the disposition of those assets. Atrusteeis designated by the trust document to manage and distribute those assets to beneficiaries, according to the wishes of the grantor as detailed in the document.\n\nA trust can be created for a variety of functions, and there are many\u00a0types of trusts. Overall, there are two categories: living and testamentary.\u00a0A will can be used to create atestamentary trust.\u00a0You can also\u00a0create arevocable living trustfor the primary purpose\u00a0of avoiding\u00a0probate court.\n\nA will becomes active only after one's death. A trust, on the other hand, becomes active the day you create it. Trusts tend to be more expensive to create and maintain than wills.\n\nImportantly, unlike wills, trusts do not go through a probate process and are not usually a matter of public record. A trust, however, can only deal with property or assets that are assigned to it.\n\nHere are the steps to take to create a will.\n\nCreating a will can often be a simple and inexpensive process where you fill out a form online without the help of anestate planning attorney. Online will makers allow you to draft, print, and sign your last will and testament via an online or downloaded document creator.\n\nThis is a morecost-effective way to establish willand trust documents compared to going to an attorney or in-person legal service. Most online will makers walk users through a series of questions to populate the required fields.\n\nThere are important distinctions between a will and a trust. Unlike a will, which can sometimes be written on one's own or using an online will maker, trusts normally are created with the assistance of a qualified attorney, but it isn't legally required.\n\nWhen a person dies without a valid will, it is said that they have diedintestate. This means that the state becomes the executor of the estate. It decides how to distribute the property and who receives payment first, without consideration for a family\u2019s circumstances. The court can even establish guardianship arrangements based on its determination of the best interests of the children.\n\nThe probate laws in most states divide property among the surviving spouse and children of the deceased. For example, a resident of Arizona, New Mexico, California, Texas, Idaho, Nevada, Washington, Louisiana, or Wisconsin who dies without a valid will must have their estate divided according to thecommunity propertylaws of the state. Community property laws recognize both spouses asjoint property owners.\n\nIn effect, the distribution hierarchy starts with the surviving spouse, who almost invariably receives at least half the decedent's estate. They may receive the entire estate if the decedent leaves no living children or grandchildren.\n\nIf the decedent is unmarried or widowed at the time of death, assets will be divided among any surviving children before any other relative. If nonext of kincan be located, the assets in the estate will become the property of the state.\n\nInvestopedia has reviewed several top online will makers. To suggest the best, we've taken into consideration ease of use, availability in all states, and the ability to update information easily.\n\nAcodicilis anaddendumof a will. It is a separate document that references and amends the will. Codicils allow one to change, add to, or remove provisions in a will. These changes can be made to keep a will and testament up to date, especially as personal circumstances change over time. Codicils can only be created by the original creator of the will.\n\nA living will does not have anything to do with the transfer of assets upon death. Also known as a healthcare directive, this legal document allows an individual (while they are alive and mentally capable) to empower another person to make decisions about their medical care if the person signing the living will becomes incapacitated. Healthcare proxies can communicate with the patient's doctors to prevent unwanted treatments and make sound decisions on their behalf.\n\nCost depends on the nature of one's estate and how complex the process of designating beneficiaries may be. A basic will can be drafted for free by an individual on their own. Online will makers range from tens to hundreds of dollars depending on scope. Hiring a lawyer can cost hundreds to thousands of dollars.\n\nA last will and testament is a fundamental legal document in an individual's estate plan. It lays out a person's final wishes pertaining to their assets. It provides specific instructions about how to distribute their possessions.\n\nThere are certain things a will cannot accomplish for a person, such as reduce estate taxes or help a family entirely avoid probate court.\n\nWills can be simple to create but have requirements that must be addressed in order for them to be considered valid. Please check your state laws regarding a last will and testament to be sure you take the right steps when creating yours.\n\nNOLO. \"Special Needs Trusts\u2014The Basics.\"\n\nFreeWill. \"Witness Requirements: Who Can (and Can\u2019t) Witness a Will?\"\n\nNational Cancer Institute. \"Living Will.\"\n\nMayo Clinic. \"Living Wills and Advance Directives for Medical Decisions.\"\n\nNolo. \"Marriage & Property Ownership: Who Owns What?\"",
