  "term": "Real Estate Limited Partnership (RELP): Definition and Roles",
  "definition": "A real estate limited partnership (RELP) is a group of investors who pool their money to invest in property purchasing, development, or leasing. It is one of several forms ofreal estate investment group(REIG). Under itslimited partnership(LP) status, a RELP has ageneral partnerwho assumes full liability and one or morelimited partnerswho are liable only up to the amount they contribute.\n\nThe general partner is usually a corporation, an experienced property manager, or a real estate development firm. The limited partners are outside investors who provide financing in exchange for an investment return.\n\nUnder U.S. tax code, partnerships are not taxed. Rather, partnerships do a so-calledpass-through, sending all of their income to the partners and reporting on formK-1. Partners receiving a K-1 must individually file their partnership income on Form 1040 if they are an individual or on Form 1120 if they are a corporation.\n\nA RELP provides individuals with the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate investments. RELPs are but one of several options available to those looking for real estate investment exposure. They also includereal estate investment trusts(REITs), managed real estate-focused investment funds, and other real estate portfolio options. A RELP may provide returns that beat other options, while simultaneously carrying comparably higher risk.\n\nDepending on the structure of the LP, partners may or may not be involved in the management of the business. Partnership agreements detail the full provisions of the business, including minimum investments, fees, distributions, partner voting, and more. Some partnerships employ a collaborative-forum type of structure for investment decisions, while others leave the core management of the business to a few executives. Generally, the management team sources and identifies deals before investing any of the group's capital.\n\nRELPs are marketed with detailed partnership agreements that define the terms of the entity and the investment opportunity overall. They generally target high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors. Some requireaccredited investorstatus for limited partnership status.\n\nMany RELPs have a narrowly defined focus: they may provide the business structure for construction of a residential neighborhood, a shopping center, or a business plaza. They often specialize in a real estate niche like retirement developments or high-value commercial properties. Some real estate investment partnerships accept investments of $5,000 to $50,000. That's not enough to purchase a unit, but the partnership will pool money from several investors to fund a property that is shared and co-owned\n\nRELPs may have high returns and high risks, makingdue diligenceimportant for prospective investors. The terms of the agreement may require the limited partner to commit to a lump sum contribution, a contribution schedule over time, or to contributions as called upon.\n\nNotably, funds invested in a limited partnership are usually illiquid. The investor can't cash out at any time.\n\nThere may be flexibility for various business activities within the portfolio. A RELP might directly invest in real estate properties, issue credit for real estate borrowers, or participate in a collaborative business deal.\n\nThe general partner usually has a vested interest in the partnership overall and provides a portion of the capital. General partners have a direct role in the management of the business with designees often serving on theboard of directorsand involved in the day-to-day management of the business. Overall, general partners hold active decision-making authority.\n\nLPs have limited liability, and it usually comes with limited influence and involvement in the entity\u2019s governance. Some entities set up advisory boards or other means of communication to encourage the insights and participation of limited partners. Generally, limited partners are hands-off investors.\n\nLimited partners receive dividend distributions along with pass-through income annually which constitutes part of their return. Many limited partnerships have a fixed-term lifespan so that partners receive their principal at a specified maturity date.\n\nAs with any partnership, a RELP is not required to pay taxes. The net income or losses are passed through to the partners annually.\n\nThis requires the partnership to file aForm 1065informational return with the Internal Revenue Service and to report all distributions of income through individual partner K-1s. All of the partners in the business receive distributions throughout the year and a distribution of income annually.\n\nThe RELP is responsible for providing each partner with a K-1 which details the income they have received for the year. Partners are then required to report their income individually as appropriate.\n\nRELPs do not pay taxes directly. Net income or losses are passed along to investors, who are responsible for tax reporting.",
