  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA drawing account is an accounting record maintained to track money and other assets withdrawn from a business by its owners. A drawing account is used primarily for businesses that are taxed assole proprietorshipsorpartnerships. Owner withdrawals from businesses that are taxed as separate entities must be accounted for generally as either compensation or dividends.\n\nAn owner\u2019s draw occurs when the owner of an unincorporated business such as a sole proprietorship, partnership, orlimited liability company (LLC)takes an asset such as money from their business for their own personal use.\n\nOwners of such businesses are free to take money from their business bank accounts and deposit it in their personal accounts to pay personal expenses as and when they choose\u2014provided, of course, that they play by the rules.\n\nA drawing account covers all assets, not just cash. For example, this means that equipment withdrawn from the business for the owner\u2019s personal use would also count as a drawing.\n\nA drawing account is acontra accountto the owner\u2019s equity. The drawing account\u2019s debit balance is contrary to the expected credit balance of an owner\u2019s equity account because owner withdrawals represent a reduction of the owner\u2019s equity in a business.\n\nIn keeping withdouble-entrybookkeeping, every journal entry requires both a debit and a credit. Because a cash withdrawal requires a credit to the cash account, an entry that debits the drawing account will have an offsetting credit to the cash account for the same amount.\n\nSince the drawing account tracks distributions to owners in a given year, it must be closed out at the end of the year with a credit (representing the total withdrawn), and the balance is transferred to the main owner\u2019s equity account with a debit. The drawing account is then reopened and used again the following year for tracking distributions.\n\nCreating a schedule from the drawing account shows the details for and summary of distributions made to each business partner. The appropriate final distributions may be made at year-end, ensuring that each partner receives the correct share of the company\u2019s earnings, according to thepartnership agreement.\n\nBecause taxes on withdrawals are paid by the individual partners, there is no tax impact on the business associated with the withdrawn funds.\n\nA journal entry to the drawing account consists of a debit to the drawing account and a credit to the cash account. Ajournal entry closingthe drawing account of a sole proprietorship includes a debit to the owner\u2019s capital account and a credit to the drawing account.\n\nFor example, at the end of an accounting year, Eve Smith\u2019s drawing account has accumulated a debit balance of $24,000. Eve withdrew $2,000 per month for personal use, recording each transaction as a debit to her drawing account and a credit to her cash account.\n\nThe journal entry closing the drawing account requires a credit to Eve\u2019s drawing account for $24,000 and a debit of $24,000 to her capital account.\n\nThe accounting entry typically would be a debit to the drawing account and a credit to the cash account\u2014or whatever asset is withdrawn.\n\nThe drawing account represents a reduction of the business\u2019s assets, as the assets in question are withdrawn and transferred to the owner for personal use.\n\nNo. Owner draws are for personal use and do not constitute a business expense. This means, among other things, that they are not tax deductible.\n\nSmall business owners should be aware of the rules before withdrawing cash or other assets from their business. Owner draws can be helpful and function as a method for a business owner to pay themselves.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that they are not considered business expenses, must be recorded in the correct way, and can weaken the company financially if made excessively.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 334, Tax Guide for Small Business.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cPublication 541, Partnerships.\u201d",
