  "term": "V-Shaped Recovery: Definition, Characteristics, and Examples",
  "definition": "Casey Murphy has fanned his passion for finance through years of writing about active trading, technical analysis, market commentary, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), commodities, futures, options, and forex (FX).\n\nA V-shaped recovery is the best case scenario after a recession: it's a quick and sustained recovery after a sharp economic decline.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is a type of economicrecessionand recovery that resembles a \"V\" shape when charting certain economic measures. There's a sharp decline, then a sharp rise back to a peak.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is one of countless shapes a recession and recovery chart can take. Others include L-shaped,W-shaped,U-shaped, and J-shaped. Each type of recovery represents the general shape of the chart of economic metrics that gauge the health of the economy. Economists develop these charts by examining the relevant measures of economic health, such as employment rates,gross domestic product (GDP), andindustrial productionindexes.\n\nIn a V-shaped recovery, an economy that has suffered a sharp economicdeclineexperiences a fast and strong rebound. Such recoveries are generally spurred by a significant shift in economic activity caused by rapid readjustment of consumer demand and business investment spending.\n\nTwo periods of recession and recovery in the U.S. stand out as examples of V-shaped recoveries.\n\nIn 1920, the U.S. entered a steep recession that some feared had the potential to become a majordepression. The U.S. economy was still adjusting from large shifts in government spending, industrial activity, and inflationarymonetary policythat had been directed to the war effort during the World War I. It was also reeling from the impact of the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918\u20131920.\n\nBy 1919, World War I had ended, and more than 1.5 million soldiers returned home from the war, flooding the economy with new workers. Simultaneously, the federal government slashed spending by 65%, including closing munitions factories that were no longer needed for the war effort. TheFederal Reserve'smonetary policy didn't help because it hiked thediscount rate, its main policy tool at the time, by 244 basis points (or 2.44%). Interest rates in the economy rose to 7% by the mid-1920s.\n\nAs a result, the postwar economy of 1920 experienced a decline in production of more than 32%, and unemployment surged to 12% as some businesses failed and many others saw a 75% drop in profits. The impact on the financial markets was devastating as theDow Jones Industrial Averageplummeted by 47% that year.\n\nBy modern standards, the monetary andfiscal policyresponses were wholly inadequate to address the deep downturn.Unemployment insuranceas we know it did not yet exist, though state and local committees that provided some relief were set up late in the recession.\n\nThe federal government's cut in spending throughout the 1920 recession, which would today be calledcontractionary fiscal policy, very likely made the recession worse.\n\nOn the monetary policy front, the Federal Reserve increased rates in 1919 and early 1920, which is contractionary because it leads to fewer loans, reducing themoney supplyin the economy. The Fed then lowered interest rates late as the economy recovered in 1921, and by 1923, interest rates were 3%. The 1919\u20131923 monetary policy would be the opposite of what policymakers would likely do today.\n\nThese apparent policy missteps resulted in a sharp, V-shaped recovery as failing businesses were quicklyliquidatedand their assets reallocated to new uses, businesses, and industries. Prices and wages fell and adjusted to reflect the new structure of production and consumption in the post-war, post-pandemic, and increasingly urbanizing society.\n\nWorkers found new jobs in the new businesses and industries, and the economy quickly recovered and entered a renewed period of expansion known as the Roaring Twenties.\u00a0As a result, theunemployment ratefell to 2.4% and gross national product rose 4.2% per year through 1929.\n\nThe recession of 1953 in the U.S. is another clear example of a V-shaped recovery. This recession was relatively brief and mild, with only a 2.2% decline in GDP and an unemployment rate that peaked at 6.1%.Growth began to slow in the third quarter of 1953, but by the fourth quarter of 1954 was back at a pace well above the trend.Therefore, the chart for this recession and recovery would represent a V-shape.\n\nAs in 1920-21, an important factor contributing to the quick recovery was the (by modern standards wholly inappropriate) policy response, or rather the lack thereof.\u00a0The Fed's monetary policy response was underwhelming, with a half-percentage-point drop in the discount rate and a three-quarters point drop in thefed funds ratelate in the recession.This represents the weakest monetary policy response in the post-World War II era. In terms of fiscal policy, the federal government took no steps to increase spending and overall tightened fiscal policy during the recession and recovery as measured by the high-employment budget surplus, an indicator of the direction of fiscal policy popular among economists.\n\nOnce again, a restrained approach to monetary and fiscal policy in the face of recession facilitated the V-shaped recovery that followed. Marring the recovery was the fact that unemployment continued to rise even after the end of the declared recession, peaking in September 1954, possibly due to the Fed's policy shift to interest rate cuts in 1954, which may have slowed the recovery.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02022\n\nEconomic recoveries can last for many years. The shapes of the chart patterns that typically form range from sharp bounces to gradual curves. There are many factors that influence economic recoveries. Traders will often look to common formations such as a double bottom, V-shape, or U-shape when planning how to position themselves during these important inflection points.\n\nA double-dip recession occurs when there is a short-term recovery followed by another recession. Sometimes, traders will use a V-, W-, or U-shaped chart pattern to mark the reversal in a primary trend. It is worth noting that a double-dip recession can lead to severe losses for those who rely on reversal patterns for trying to time a market or economic reversal.\n\nAdouble bottomis a reversal pattern that is used by followers of technical analysis to mark a major shift in the price of a security. More broadly, traders also use chart patterns such as a double bottom, or V-shape, to mark major shifts in broad market indexes and changes in economic sentiment.\n\nA reversal pattern is a chart pattern used by followers of technical analysis to mark the shift in the direction of the predominant trend. Common examples include double top, double bottom, triple top, and triple bottom. Broadly speaking, reversal patterns often follow a V-, W-, or U-shape, depending on the conviction of market participants.\n\nA V-shaped recovery is a type of economic recession and recovery that resembles a \"V\" shape in economists' and traders' charting. This type of recovery involves a sharp rise back to a previous peak after a sharp decline in these measurements.\n\nSuch recoveries are usually powered by a significant shift in economic activity caused by a rapid readjustment of consumer demand and spending on business investments.\n\nHistory. \"When WWI, Pandemic and Slump Ended, Americans Sprang Into the Roaring Twenties.\"\n\nBerkeley Economic Review. \"In the Shadow of the Slump: The Depression of 1920-1921.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED. \"Discount Rates, Federal Reserve Bank of New York for United States.\"\n\nThe Economic History Association. \"The U.S. Economy in the 1920s.\"\n\nThe Foundation for Economic Education. \"The Depression You've Never Heard Of: 1920-1921.\"\n\nHistory. \"How the U.S. Got Out of 13 Recessions Since World War II.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED. \"Real Gross Domestic Product.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Federal Reserve Policy and Economic Stability 1951-57 Report,\" Pages 19-40.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, FRED. \"Unemployment Rate.\"",
