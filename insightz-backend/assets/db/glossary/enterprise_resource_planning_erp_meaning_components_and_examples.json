  "term": "Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Meaning, Components, and Examples",
  "definition": "Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a platform companies use to manage and integrate the essential parts of their businesses. Many ERP software applications are critical to companies because they help them implement resource planning by integrating all the processes needed to run their companies with a single system.\n\nAn ERP software system can also integrate planning, purchasing inventory, sales, marketing, finance, human resources, and more.\n\nYou can think of an enterprise resource planning system as the\u00a0glue that binds together\u00a0the different computer systems for a large organization. Without an ERP application, each department would have its system optimized for its specific tasks. With ERP software, each department still has its system, but all of the systems can be accessed through one application with one interface.\n\nERP applications also allow the different departments to communicate and share information more easily with the rest of the company. It collects information about the activity and state of different divisions, making this information available to other parts, where it can be used productively.\n\nERP applications can help a corporation become more self-aware by linking information about production, finance, distribution, and human resources together. Because it connects different technologies used by each part of a business, an ERP application can eliminate costly duplicates and incompatible technology. The process often integrates accounts payable, stock control systems, order-monitoring systems, and customer databases into one system.\n\nERP has evolved over the years from traditional software models that made use of physical client servers and manual entry systems to cloud-based software with remote, web-based access. The platform is generally maintained by the company that created it, with client companies renting services provided by the platform.\n\nBusinesses select the applications they want to use. Then, the hosting company loads the applications onto the server the client is renting, and both parties begin working to integrate the client's processes and data into the platform.\n\nOnce all departments are tied into the system, all data is collected on the server and becomes instantly available to those with permission to use it. Reports can be generated with metrics, graphs, or other visuals and aids a client might need to determine how the business and its departments are performing.\n\nA company could experience cost overruns if its ERP system is not implemented carefully.\n\nThere's a number of different ERP solutions that can meet a variety of business needs. This list is not meant to list every single type of ERP, though the list is pretty comprehensive. Any business considering implementing an ERP system should be able to find value in some of these types of systems, and multiple systems may be relevant in any given situation.\n\nOn-premises ERP systems involve purchasing the software licenses and installing the ERP system directly onto a company's own servers. Companies have full control over the system and data, as it resides within their premises. Customization and integration with existing systems can be more extensive, and this type of ERP usually requires dedicated IT resources for maintenance, updates, and security.\n\nCloud ERP systems are hosted on remote servers and accessed through the internet. Cloud ERPs likeSaaS productsoffer better scalability, allowing businesses to easily adjust resources and features as needed without significant upfront investment in hardware. Cloud ERP systems typically have a subscription-based pricing model, and updates/maintenance are managed by the ERP provider (not the company itself).\n\nIndustry-specific ERP systems are tailored to meet the unique needs and requirements of particular industries. These systems often include industry-specific modules, functionalities, and best practices to address the complexities of the industry. For example, consider a manufacturing firm that is heavily reliant on inventory, supply chain management, and distribution of goods. That type of ERP will be vastly different than a client-based ERP such as a financial institution's ERP.\n\nAnopen-sourceERP system (or any open-source software, for that matter) provides users with access to the source code. This means a company can customize, modify, or redistribute the ERP to better meet the company's needs. Implementing and maintaining open-source ERP systems may require more technical expertise and resources compared to commercial ERP solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, small business ERP systems are designed specifically for the needs of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). These types of ERP systems try to offer balance between being slightly niche while offering essential functionalities at a more affordable price point. Because they are less robust, small business ERP solutions are often easier to implement and require less customization compared to enterprise-level ERP systems.\n\nTiered ERP systems offer different levels of functionality and scalability to cater to businesses of varying sizes and complexity. Companies can choose the tier that best matches their current needs and budget, with the option to upgrade or customize as their requirements evolve. This would entail adding on modules as they become relevant (i.e. a company that is scaling to international operations may wait to implement foreign current modules).\n\nBusinesses employ enterprise resource planning (ERP) for various reasons, such as expanding, reducing costs, and improving operations. The benefits sought and realized between companies may differ; however, some are worth noting.\n\nIntegrating and automating business processes eliminates redundancies and improves accuracy and productivity. In addition, departments with interconnected processes can synchronize work to achieve faster and better outcomes.\n\nSome businesses benefit from enhanced real-time data reporting from a single source system. Accurate and complete reporting help companies adequately plan, budget, forecast, and communicate the state of operations to the organization and interested parties, such as shareholders.\n\nERPs allow businesses to quickly access needed information for clients, vendors, and business partners. This contributes to improved customer and employee satisfaction, quicker response rates, and increased accuracy rates. In addition, associated costs often decrease as the company operates more efficiently.\n\nERP software also provides total visibility, allowing management to access real-time data fordecision-making.\n\nDepartments are better able to collaborate and share knowledge; a newly synergized workforce can improve productivity and employee satisfaction as employees are better able to see how each functional group contributes to the mission and vision of the company. Also, menial and manual tasks are eliminated, allowing employees to allocate their time to more meaningful work.\n\nAn ERP system doesn't always eliminate inefficiencies within a business or improve everything. The company might need to rethink how it's organized or risk ending up with incompatible technology.\n\nERP systems usually fail to achieve the objectives that influenced their installation because of a company's reluctance to abandon old working processes. Some companies may also be reluctant to let go of old software that worked well in the past. The key is to prevent\u00a0ERP projects from being split into smaller projects, which can result in cost overruns.\n\nEmploying change management principles throughout the ERP life cycle can prevent or reduce failures that compromise full implementation.\n\nERP andcustomer relationship management (CRM)platforms are two different types of software systems used in business. At their core, ERP focuses on internal business processes and operations, while CRM is centered around managing interactions with customers and prospects.\n\nERP systems are designed to integrate and automate core business functions. In contrast, CRM systems are dedicated to managing customer relationships and interactions. This can range from things like sales leads, marketing campaigns, customer service inquiries, and contact management. While the goal of ERPs is to streamline processes, the goal of CRMs is to enhance customer engagement, satisfaction, and loyalty.\n\nDespite their distinct focus areas, ERP and CRM systems often overlap in certain areas. Many modern ERP systems include CRM functionalities. This integration enables businesses to synchronize customer information, such as contact details, purchase history, and communication logs, between ERP and CRM systems. For example, a CRM would traditionally host a customer's purchase history. By looping that into a broader ERP system, a company can predict when the customer will re-order, make sure it has sufficient quantity on hand at a specific time, and make sure it has enough personnel on hand at a specific time to fulfill the potential order.\n\nSome familiar names are leaders in ERP software. Oracle Corp. (ORCL) originally supplied a relational database that integrated with ERP software developed by SAP (SAP) before launching their own ERP.Microsoft (MSFT) has long been an industry leader, with many customers using multiple software applications from the company.\n\nAs cloud-based solutions have grown in popularity in recent years, the traditional ERP industry leaders have seen challenges from upstarts such as Bizowie and Workwise.\n\nAs of 2013, New York gallery Ronin Gallery still used paper for inventory and a standalone software for accounting. After moving the whole business to Oracle NetSuite products, including NetSuite ERP, the productivity of its employees doubled. All inventory and consignment information are now in one place and accessible to the right employees, and the gallery can make tailored recommendations to more than 30,000 customers.\n\nN&N moving supplies moved to NetSuite after adding locations. The company had been having trouble keeping track of business and accounting data as it was in multiple places. With NetSuite the company reduced payroll processing time by 84%. The company also improved the accuracy of time tracking and could see data from across its locations.\n\nGreen Rabbit, a perishable goods logistics company, was running off of standalone accounting software, spreadsheets, and email. On this system communication was poor, and data was not synched, hurting efficiency. ERP software help cut inventory errors, increase order fulfillment without delays, The company now also has error free synchronized data, and tripled its order volume.\n\nWhen selecting an ERP system, there's many things for you to consider. Here are some key features to consider during your decision-making process:\n\nEnterprise resource planning, or ERP, is an interconnected system that aggregates and distributes information across a company. The goal of an ERP system is to communicate relevant information from one area of a business to another. For example, an ERP system could automatically notify the purchasing department when the manufacturing department begins to run low on a specific type of raw material.\n\nEnterprise resource planning software offers single-system solutions that integrate processes across the business. These applications allow users to interact within a single interface, share information, and enable cross-functional collaboration. They increase productivity, collaboration, and efficiency.\n\nThe components of an ERP system depend on the organization's needs. However, there are key features that each ERP should include. Generally, packages include finance, human resource, logistics and manufacturing, supply chain management, and customer relationship management.\n\nWhich ones are the main applications depends on the business and the industry it operates in. Most companies can benefit from supply chain management, logistics, and financial applications to help them streamline their operations and expenses.\n\nEnterprise resource planning manages and integrates business processes through a single system. With a better line of sight, companies can better plan and allocate resources. Without ERP, companies tend to operate in silos, with each department using its own disconnected system.\n\nERP systems promote the free flow of communication and sharing of knowledge across an organization, the integration of systems for improved productivity and efficiencies, and increased synergies across teams and departments. However, moving to an ERP system will be counterproductive if the company's culture does not adjust to the change and the company does not review how the structure of its organization can support it.\n\nOracle. \"Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP).\"\n\nOracle. \"Oracle for SAP Cloud and Infrastructure Update.\"\n\nOracle NetSuite. \"3 Successful ERP Implementation Case Studies.\"",
