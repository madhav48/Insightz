  "term": "Leading Indicators: Definition and How They\u2019re Used by Investors",
  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nA leading indicator is a measurable set of data that may help to forecast future economic activity. Leading economic indicators can be used to predict changes in theeconomybefore the economy begins to shift in a particular direction. They have the potential to be useful for businesses, investors, and policy makers.\n\nLeading indicators are one of three main types of indicators. The other two arelagging indicatorsandcoincident indicators.\n\nLeading indicators must be measurable to be useful as predictors of where the economy may be headed. Policy makers andcentral bankersuse leading indicators when settingfiscalormonetary policy.Businesses study them to anticipate the effect of future economic conditions and then make strategic decisions regarding markets and revenue.\n\nAll businesses track their ownbottom linesandbalance sheets, but such data are lagging indicators, meaning they're produced by events that have already happened. Importantly, a business\u2019 past performance does not necessarily indicate how it will do in the future.\n\nInvestors use leading indicators to guide theirinvestment strategiesas they try to anticipate market conditions. Many focus on those indicators directly related to thestock market.\u00a0These can include the housing market, retail sales, building permits, business startups, and more.\n\nEconomists closely watch thePurchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI). The PMI reflects trends in the manufacturing and service sectors and can be a useful signal of growth in a nation\u2019sgross domestic product (GDP)due to changes in the demand for materials from corporations.\n\nDurable goods ordersis a monthly survey of manufacturers that is produced by the U.S.Census Bureau. It measures industrial activity in the durable goods sector and the state of thesupply chain.\n\nAlong with durable goods orders, many people consider theConsumer Confidence Index (CCI)to be one of the most accurate leading indicators. This index surveys consumers about their attitudes toward the economy and their perceptions of economic activity going forward.\n\nThe U.S.Department of Laborprovides a weekly report on the number ofjobless claimsas an indicator of the economy\u2019s health.A rise in jobless claims indicates a weakening economy, which could have a negative effect on the stock market. A drop in jobless claims may indicate that companies are growing (and hiring), which can be positive for the stock market.\n\nMany market participants consider theyield curveto be a leading indicator. Of particular interest is the spread between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields. This is because two-year yields in excess of 10-year yields have been correlated to both recession and short-term marketvolatility. If such aninverted yield curveoccurs, it may signal that arecessionis approaching.\n\nWhile not a metric issued by economists or government agencies, customer complaints or negative online reviews can be seen as a leading indicator of customer dissatisfaction that may signal problems with a business\u2019 product quality or service failures. These can point to lower futurerevenue,growth, orprofits. Conversely, positive customer satisfaction data may suggest that these factors will trend upward in the future.\n\nLeading indicators often present tradeoffs among accuracy, precision, and lead time in predicting future events.\n\nLeading indicators are not always accurate. However, looking at several leading indicators in conjunction with other types of data may provide actionable information about the future health of an economy.\n\nAn ideal leading indicator would predict changes in economic trends or business performance accurately, within a narrow range of estimates, and over a major time horizon. However, in practice, all leading indicators show variable performance along these lines.\n\nFor example, the advance warning of economic downturns provided bycapital goodsnew orders data can offer a long lead time for action. However, the historical lead time between turning points in capital goods and a specific target indicator such as changing stock prices or GDP may range from 12 to 24 months. You end up with data indicating a long lead time for action but low precision about when to take it.\n\nWhat's more, the magnitude of changes in capital goods new orders might not bear any consistent relationship with the size of changes in GDP, making it inaccurate except as an indicator of timing. Therefore, this indicator would be useful as a long-term warning sign, but it would not support a precise estimate of the timing or size of futuretrends.\n\nOn the other hand, a leading indicator might give highly accurate and precise information about a turning point or trend in the market or the economy, but only over a few months or quarters. Such an indicator could provide detailed input forestimating the trends that affect your business or investments. But it might not provide that information in sufficient time to take full advantage of the insight gained.\n\nBy themselves, both types of leading indicators might be helpful. Yet neither provides the full picture needed to maximize performance. In practice, this means that using a range of different leading indicators that are more or less accurate, precise, and forward-looking can provide the best opportunity to capitalize on future trends.\n\nWhile leading indicators can provide insight into the advisability of taking actions as a government, a business, or an investor, they have nothing to do with the impact that results from taking those actions.\n\nLeading indicators are used to predict future economic performance. Lagging indicators are data that reflect past economic performance. They're used to confirm economic change and financial market patterns.\n\nLeading indicators are measurable pieces or sets of data that may suggest future economic, business, or investment trends. A lagging indicator is a measurable figure or set of data that changes at some point after an economic or business trend occurs.\n\nLeading indicators are one of the three main types of broader economic indicators. The others are lagging indicators (which reflect past activity) and coincident indicators (which reflect current activity).\n\nThe reports are issued by various government agencies and other organizations. Certain business publications (e.g., theWall Street Journal) will publish a calendar of upcoming announcements as well as the actual data. Some of the entities responsible for the data include the The Conference Board (Consumer Confidence Index), the U.S. Department of Labor (jobless claims), and the U.S. Census Bureau (durable goods orders).\n\nOne of the most famous examples is the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI). This is a survey regularly performed by The Conference Board to determine how optimistic or pessimistic consumers are about their expected future financial situation.\n\nLeading indicators have the potential to be a highly valuable tool for economists, investors, business owners, and consumers. When used properly, they can signal upcoming changes and broad trends in the economy.\n\nHowever, the economy is not guaranteed to behave in the way that leading indicators suggest, and it is crucial that you know which indicators are most appropriate to evaluate and how to properly make use of them.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of Chicago. \u201cWhich Leading Indicators Have Done Better at Signaling Past Recessions?\u201d\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics. \u201cUnited States\u2014Purchasing Managers Index.\u201d\n\nU.S. Census Bureau. \u201cWhy New Data on Durable Goods Matter.\u201d\n\nThe Conference Board. \u201cU.S. Consumer Confidence.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cHow the Government Measures Unemployment.\u201d\n\nForex.com. \u201cTreasury Yields Explained: What Does the Yield Curve Tell Us?\u201d",
