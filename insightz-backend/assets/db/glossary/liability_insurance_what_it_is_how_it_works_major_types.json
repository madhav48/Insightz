Intentional damage and contractual liabilities are generally not covered in liability insurance policies.\n\nUnlike other types of insurance, liability insurance policies pay third parties, and not policyholders.\n\nLiability insurance is critical for those who are liable and at fault for injuries sustained by other people or in the event that the insured party damages someone else'sproperty. As such, liability insurance is also calledthird-party insurance. Liability insurance does not cover intentional or criminal acts even if the insured party is found legally responsible. Policies are taken out by anyone who owns a business, drives a car, practices medicine or law\u2014basically anyone who can be sued for damages and/or injuries. Policies protect both the insured and third parties who may be injured as a result of the policyholder's unintentional negligence.\n\nLiability insurance is also called third-party insurance.\n\nFor instance, most states require that vehicle owners have liability insurance under their automotive insurance policies to cover injury to other people and property in the event of accidents. A product manufacturer may purchase product liability insurance to cover them if a product is faulty and causes damage to the purchasers or another third party. Business owners may purchase liability insurance that covers them if an employee is injured during business operations. The decisions doctors and surgeons make while on the job also require liability insurance policies.\n\nPersonal liability insurance policies are purchased primarily byhigh-net-worth individuals(HNWIs) or those with sizeable assets, but this type of coverage is recommended\u00a0to anyone with anet worththat exceeds the combined coverage limits of other personal insurance policies, such as home and auto coverage. The cost of an additional insurance policy doesn't appeal to everyone, although most carriers offer reduced rates for bundled coverage packages. Personal liability insurance is considered a secondary policy and may require policyholders to carry certain limits on their home and auto policies, which may result in additional expenses.\n\nThe global liability insurance market size was valued at more than $25 billion in 2021, and is expected to reach $433 billion by 2031.\n\nAlthough commercial general liability insurance protects against most legal hassles, it doesn't protect directors and officers from being sued, and it doesn't protect the insured against errors and omissions. Companies require special policies for these cases including:\n\nBusiness owners are exposed to a range of liabilities, any of which can subject their assets to substantial claims. All business owners need to have anasset protection planin place that's built around available liability insurance coverage.\n\nHere are the main types of liability insurance:\n\nPersonal liability insurance covers individuals against claims resulting from injuries or damage to other people or property experienced on the insured's property or as a result of the insured's actions.Business liability insuranceinstead protects the financial interests of companies and business owners from lawsuits or damages resulting from similar accidents but also extending to product defects, recalls, and so on.\n\nAn umbrella insurance policy is additional liability insurance\u00a0coverage that is purchased and goes beyond the dollar limits of the insured's existing homeowners, auto, orwatercraft insurance. Umbrella policies tend to be affordable and offered in increments of $500,000 or $1 million.\n\nUsually, you must have liability coverage in place when an event happens that results in a claim.Backdated liability insurance, however, is insurance that provides coverage for a claim that occurred before the insurance policy was purchased. These policies are uncommon and usually available only to businesses.\n\nAllied Market Research. \"Liability Insurance.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"Workers Compensation.\"",
