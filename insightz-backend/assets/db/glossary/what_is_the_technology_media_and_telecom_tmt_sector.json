Big tech companies increasingly dominate the TMT sector. Investors target the TMT sector and find companies like Meta (META) and Netflix (NFLX) in investment vehicles like the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC).\n\nSector companies focus on hardware, software, servers, mobile devices, tablets, and storage. Within hardware,semiconductormanufacturers develop and produce integrated circuits and microchips used in all sorts of applications. Software companies produce computer or mobile applications for both individuals and enterprises.\n\nMedia firms develop, produce, and distribute multimedia content on TV, print, and online. Television networks, cable TV providers, production studios, and social media companies are all in this subsector. Telecom focuses on communications-related businesses such as phone, TV, andinternet service providers.\n\nMarket participants may categorize TMT companies into different subsectors, so there are many examples of companies in multiple TMT subsectors. Meta may be viewed as either an internet company or a media company. Apple can be placed in the internet, hardware, software, or media category. Other examples that cross subsectors are Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. Sometimes, companies in one subsector of TMT will merge or acquire another toconsolidate, diversify, and broaden product offerings.\n\nIn 2024, leading American companies in the TMT Sector include Apple, AT&T, Microsoft, Verizon, and Comcast.\n\nThe TMT sector includes companies that depend on research & development (R&D).

New technologies are continually developed in the TMT sector, and some companies may eventually become household names.\n\nBecause this industry segment covers a broad range, it is often helpful to divide TMT into subsectors, such as hardware, semiconductors, software, media, and telecommunications. The TMT sector contains new and hi-tech firms, so it experiences many mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs). Each subsector also has different growth metrics and prospects.\n\nAccording to a survey by PwC in 2024, 72% of CEOs in the technology, media, and telecommunications segments think technology improvements will change how their companies create, deliver, or earn value through 2027.\n\nIn 2024, more than half of all TMT companies use Generative Artificial Intelligence to amplify the consumer experience. AI helps companies personalize services and boost content recommendation engines.\n\nInvestors may choose funds that hold technology, media, and telecommunication stocks. Examples include the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), the Vanguard Communication Services ETF (VOX), and the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC).\n\nNew or changing technologies often spark companies to merge or acquire others. In 2024, software is the leading subsector within TMT experiencing the most M&A activity.\n\nThe TMT sector includes companies focused on new technologies and commonly represented by entities that provide hardware, semiconductors, software, media, and telecommunications.
