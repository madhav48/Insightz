  "term": "Off-The-Run Treasuries: What They are, How They Work",
  "definition": "Off-the-run treasuries are all Treasury bonds and notes issued before the most recently issued bond or note of a particular maturity.\n\nOff-the-run treasuries can be contrasted withon-the-run treasuries, which refer to the newest issues only.\n\nWhen theU.S. Treasuryissues securities \u2013 Treasury notes, and bonds \u2013 it does so through anauction processto determine the price at which these debt instruments will be offered. Based on the bids received and the level of interest shown for the security, the U.S. Treasury is able to set a price for its debt securities. The new issues presented after the auction is closed are referred to as on-the-run Treasuries. Once a new Treasury security of any maturity is issued, the previously issued security with the same maturity becomes the off-the-run bond or note.\n\nFor example, if the U.S. Treasury newly issued 5-year notes in February, these notes are on-the-run and replace the previously issued 5-year notes, which become off-the-run. In March, if another batch of 5-year bonds is issued, these March notes are on-the-run Treasuries and the February notes are now off-the-run. And so on.\n\nWhile on-the-run Treasuries are available to be purchased fromTreasury Direct, off-the-run securities can only be obtained from other investors through thesecondary market. When Treasuries move to the secondary over-the-counter market, they become less frequently traded as investors prefer to go for more liquid securities (which are a characteristic of on-the-run Treasuries). To encourage investors to purchase these debt securities readily in the market, off-the-run Treasuries are typically less expensive and carry a slightly greater yield.\n\nSince off-the-run Treasuries have a higher yield and lower price than on-the-run Treasuries, there is a notableyield spreadbetween both offerings. One reason for the yield spread is the concept of supply. On-the-run Treasuries are typically issued with a fixed supply. The high demand for the limited securities pushes up their prices and, in turn, lowers the yield, causing a difference to ensue between the yields for on-the-run and off-the-run securities. In addition, off-the-run securities are mostly held to maturity in an asset manager\u2019s portfolio as there\u2019s not much reason to trade them. On the other hand, when portfolio managers need to shift their exposure tointerest rate riskand findarbitrageopportunities, they trade on-the-run Treasuries, creating liquidity for these securities.\n\nAlthough on-the-run treasury yield can be used to construct aninterpolated yield curve, which is used to determine the price of debt securities, some analysts prefer to use the yield of off-the-run Treasuries to draw theyield curve. Off-the-run yields are used in cases where the demand for on-the-run Treasuries are inconsistent, thereby, causing price distortions caused by the fluctuating current demand. By deriving yield curve figures from theoff-the-run Treasury rates, financial analysts can ensure that temporary fluctuations in demand do not skew the yield curve calculations or the pricing of fixed income investments.",
