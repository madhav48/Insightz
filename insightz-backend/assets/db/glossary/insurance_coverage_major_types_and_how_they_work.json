  "term": "Insurance Coverage: Major Types and How They Work",
  "definition": "Insurance coverage is the amount of risk orliabilitythat is covered for an individual or entity by way of insurance services. Insurance coverage, such as auto insurance,life insurance\u2014or more exotic forms, such as hole-in-one insurance\u2014is issued by an insurer in the event of unforeseen occurrences.\n\nInsurance coverage helps consumers recover financially from unexpected events, such as car accidents or the loss of an income-producing adult supporting a family. In exchange for this coverage, the insured person pays apremiumto the insurance company. Insurance coverage and its costs are often determined by multiple factors.\n\nPremiums are a way for the insurance company to manage risk. When there's an increased possibility that an insurance company may have to pay out money toward a claim, they can offset that risk by charging a higher premium.\n\nFor example, most insurers charge higher premiums for young male drivers, as insurers deem the probability of young men being involved in an accident to be higher than, say, a middle-aged married man with years of driving experience.\n\nInsurance companies use theunderwriting processto evaluate you for risk and use the information they collect to set your premiums.\n\nThere are different types of insurance coverage someone may need. Here are some of the most common options for insuring yourself and your property.\n\nAuto insurance can protect you in the event of an accident. In all 50 states, excluding New Hampshire, drivers are required to have minimum amounts ofliability insurance coverage.This includes both bodily injury liability coverage and property damage liability coverage. Bodily injury liability coverage pays for the medical expenses of another person if they're injured in an accident for which you are at fault. Property damage liability coverage pays for damages to someone else's property when you're at fault in an accident.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may also be required to have:\n\nAuto insurance premiums\u00a0typically depend on the insured party's driving record. A record free of accidents or serious traffic violations may result in a lower premium. Drivers with histories of accidents or serious traffic violations may pay higher premiums. Likewise, because mature drivers tend to have fewer accidents than less-experienced drivers, insurers typically charge more for drivers below age 25.\n\nIf a person drives his car for work or typically drives long distances, he generally pays more forauto insurancepremiums, because his increased mileage likewise increases his chances for accidents. People who do not drive as much pay less.\n\nBecause of higher vandalism rates, thefts and accidents, urban drivers pay higher premiums than those living in small towns or rural areas. Other factors varying among states include the cost and frequency of litigation, medical care and repair costs, the prevalence of auto insurance fraud, and weather trends.\n\nOptions for saving money on auto insurance premiums include asking about safe driver discounts andbundlingcoverage with homeowners or other types of insurance.\n\nLife insurance is designed to provide a measure of financial security for your loved ones if you pass away. These policies allow you to name aprimary beneficiaryand one or morecontingent beneficiariesto receive a death benefit should you pass away.\n\nTerm life insurance coversyou for a set time period. For example, you may choose a 20- or 25-year term policy.Permanent life insurancecovers you as long as your premiums are paid, which can effectively translate to lifetime coverage. Permanent life insurance can also allow you to build cash value over time that you could borrow against if necessary.\n\nTypes of permanent life insurance include:\n\nWith either type of life insurance (i.e. term or permanent), you can choose thedeath benefitamount you would like your beneficiaries to receive, i.e. $500,000, $1 million or even more. Between term life and permanent life insurance, term life tends to offer lower premium costs since you're only covered for a set period of time.\n\nPremiums can depend on the age of the insured party and their gender. Because younger people are less likely to die than older people, younger people typically pay lower life insurance costs. And since women tend to live longer than men, women tend to pay lower premiums.\n\nEngaging in risky behaviors, such as a potentially dangerous hobby or using drugs and alcohol, could cause life insurance premiums to be higher.\n\nHealth is another important factor in determining life insurance costs. People in good health typically pay lower life insurance premiums. For example, the risk of dying for a person with a 30-year policy is greater than the risk of dying for a person with a 10-year policy.\n\nA history of chronic disease or other potential health issues with an individual or family, such as heart disease or cancer, may result in paying higher premiums. Obesity, alcohol consumption, or smoking can affect rates as well. An applicant typically goes through a medical exam to determine whether he has high blood pressure or other signs of potential health issues that may result in premature death for the applicant and increased risk for the insurance company.\n\nNo exam life insurance policies allow you to skip the medical exam but you may pay higher premium costs.\n\nHomeowner's insuranceis designed to protect against financial losses associated with covered incidents involving your home. For example, a typical homeowner's insurance policy covers both the home and its contents in the event of:\n\nYour policy can pay for repairs to your home or in extreme cases, to rebuild the home. Homeowner's insurance can also pay to replace lost or damaged belongings as well as replacement or repairs for associated structures, such as a garage or storage shed.\n\nHomeowner's insurance premiums can depend on the value of the home, policy coverage amounts and where the home is located. For example, you may pay more to insure a home that's located in an area prone to hurricanes or tornadoes.\n\nStandard homeowner's insurance policies typically do not cover events like earthquakes orflood-related damage. You'd need to purchase separate coverage to be protected against those scenarios.",
