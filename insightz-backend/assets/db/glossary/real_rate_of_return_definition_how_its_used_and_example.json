  "term": "Real Rate of Return: Definition, How It's Used, and Example",
  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe real rate of return is the annual percentage of profit earned on an investment, adjusted for inflation. Therefore, the real rate of return accurately indicates the actualpurchasing powerof a given amount of money over time.\n\nAdjusting the nominal return to compensate for inflation allows the investor to determine how much of a nominal return is real return.\n\nIn addition to adjusting for inflation, investors also must consider the impact of other factors, such as taxes and investing fees, to calculate real returns on their money or to choose among various investing options.\n\nThe real rate of return is calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the nominal interest rate.\n\nAssume a bond pays an interest rate of 5% per year. If the inflation rate is currently 3% per year, then the real return on your savings is only 2%.\n\nIn other words, even though the nominalrate of returnon your savings is 5%, the real rate of return is only 2%, which means thereal valueof your savings increases by only 2% in a year.\n\nConsidered another way, assume you have saved $10,000 to buy a car but decide to invest the money for a year before buying to ensure that you have a small cash cushion left over after getting the car. Earning 5% interest, you have $10,500 after 12 months. However, because prices increased by 3% during the same period due to inflation, the same car now costs $10,300.\n\nConsequently, the amount of money that remains after you buy the car\u2014which represents your increase in purchasing power\u2014is $200, or 2% of your initial investment. This is your real rate of return, as it represents the amount that you gained after accounting for the effects of inflation.\n\nInterest rates can be expressed in two ways: as nominal rates, or as real rates. The difference is that nominal rates are not adjusted for inflation, while real rates are.As a result, nominal rates are almost always higher, except during those rare periods when deflation, or negative inflation, takes hold.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, the profits from double-digit interest rates were eaten up by the effects of double-digit inflation.\n\nAn example of the potential gap between nominal and real rates of return occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Double-digit nominal interest rates on savings accounts were commonplace\u2014but so was double-digit inflation. Prices increased by 11.25% in 1979 and 13.55% in 1980.Therefore, real rates of return were significantly lower than their nominal-rate counterparts.\n\nSo should an investor rely on the nominal rate or the real rate? Real rates give an accurate historical picture of how an investment performed. But the nominal rates are what you\u2019ll see advertised on an investment product.\n\nThe problem with real rate of return is that you don\u2019t know what it is until it has already happened. That is, inflation for any given period is a trailing indicator, which can only be calculated after the relevant period has ended.\n\nIn addition, the real rate of return isn\u2019t entirely accurate until it also accounts for other costs, such as taxes and investing fees.\n\nTrailing refers to the property of a measurement, indicator, or data series that reflects a past event or observation. It is usually attached to a specified time interval by which the data trail or over which that data is aggregated, summed, or averaged. Trailing data and indicators are used to reveal underlying trends but can delay recognition of trend turning points. Trailing can also refer to a type of stop order used by traders.\n\nAreal interest rateis an interest rate that has been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation to reflect the realcost of fundsto the borrower and the real yield to the lender or to an investor.\u00a0Anominal interest raterefers to theinterest ratebefore takinginflationinto account.Nominalcan also refer to the advertised or stated interest rate on a loan, without taking into account any fees or compounding of interest.\n\nInflation is the decline ofpurchasing powerof a given currency over time. A quantitative estimate of the rate at which the decline in purchasing power occurs can be reflected in the increase of an average price level of abasket of selected goodsand services in an economy over some period of time. The rise in the general level of prices, often expressed as a percentage, means that a unit of currency effectively buys less than it did in prior periods.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \"Bond Yield and Return.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Getting Real About Interest Rates - The Economic Lowdown Podcast Series.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Federal Funds Effective Rate.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Inflation, Consumer Prices for the United States.\"",
