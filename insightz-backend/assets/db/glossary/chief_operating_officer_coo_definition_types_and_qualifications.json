  "term": "Chief Operating Officer (COO): Definition, Types, and Qualifications",
  "definition": "The chief operating officer (COO) is a senior executive tasked with overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business. The COO typically reports directly to thechief executive officer(CEO) and is considered to be second in the chain of command.\n\nIn some corporations, the COO is known by other terms, such as \"executive vice president of operations,\" \"chief operations officer,\" or \"operations director.\"\n\nTheCOOmainly focuses on executing the company\u2019sbusiness plan, according to the established business model, while the CEO is more concerned with long-term goals and the broader company outlook. In other words, the CEO devises plans, while the COO implements them.\n\nFor instance, when a company experiences a drop inmarket share, the CEO might call for increased quality control, in order to fortify its reputation among customers.\n\nIn this case, the COO might carry out the CEO's mandate by instructing the human resources department to hire morequality controlpersonnel. The COO may also initiate the rollout of new product lines, and may likewise be responsible for production, research and development, and marketing.\n\nA chief operating officer is responsible for the day-to-day operations of a company. Their responsibilities can include:\n\nKeep in mind that the role of a COO may vary from company to company according to each firm's needs.\n\nDepending on the CEO's preference, the COO often handles a company's internal affairs, while the CEO functions as the public face of the company, and thereby handles all outward-facing communication.\n\nInstead of having one or two skill sets, most successful COOs have multifaceted talents, enabling them to adapt to different tasks and solve a range of issues.\n\nIn many cases, a COO is specifically chosen to complement the skill sets of the sitting CEO. In an entrepreneurial situation, the COO often has more practical experience than the founding CEO, who may have come up with an excellent concept but lacks the start-up know-how to launch a company and manage its early stages of development.\n\nConsequently, COOs often design operations strategies, communicate policies to employees, and helphuman resources(HR) build core teams.\n\nEvery company is different and in a different stage of growth. A new company will have very different needs than a company that has been around for 100 years and has a large market share in its industry. Depending on the company, its needs, its cycle stage, and its unique characteristics, the specific type of COO required to help it realize its goals will vary.\n\nThere are generally seven types of COOs:\n\nA COO typically has extensive\u00a0experience in the field within which a given company operates. COOs often work for at least 15 years climbing the corporate ladder. This slow build helps prepare COOs for their roles, by letting them cultivate extensive experience in the practices, policies, and procedures of their chosen field.\n\nAlso, because they're traditionally responsible for directing multiple departments, COOs must be resourceful problem solvers and must possess strong leadership skills. Educationally, COOs typically hold bachelor's degrees at a minimum, while often also holding Master's in Business Administration (MBA) degrees and other certifications.\n\nThe path to becoming a COO can be a long one, just like for any C-suite role. It can take many years of learning on the job as well as in school. Others become COO much more quickly, such as by joining a startup or starting a business.\n\nTo develop your skills to become a chief operating officer, you'll likely focus on the following steps:\n\nThere are some basic similarities between these two roles. Both the CEO and COO are inside directors of a company. They both are tasked with participating in daily management activities to keep the company running smoothly.\n\nThe difference between a COO and a CEO starts with the organizational chart: the CEO is at the top of the chain of command, with the COO second in command, reporting to the CEO.\n\nWhere the CEO is typically outward-facing, the COO is typically inward-facing, in charge of internal operations and communications. And while the CEO devises business strategy, it is the COO who oversees its implementation.\n\nOracle is a technology firm that began in 1977. It sells database software, cloud technology, management systems, and a variety of other products. Oracle had been performing well as a company but then hit a growth cap and couldn't increase annual revenue past $1 billion for a period of time.\n\nIn 1992, Larry Ellison, then CEO and now executive chair andchief technology officer (CTO), brought in Ray Lane to turn the company's fortunes around. Lane joined as Senior Vice President and President of Oracle USA. He became COO in 1996.\n\nWhen Lane came on board, he integrated packaged software and high-margin professional service. In this aspect, he was selling two products in one cycle, increasing revenues from one sale.\n\nAccording to him, because the people providing the professional service were experts on the product, the company could charge a high price for it, resulting in a highmargin.\n\nIn 1992, Oracle had sales of $1.8 billion and profits of $61.5 million. In 1997, it had $5.7 billion in sales and profits of $821.5 million.\n\nIn 1999, Lane received a salary of $1 million and a $2.25 million bonus. He was also given 1.125 million in stock options, at the time valued between $11.8 million and $30 million.\n\nThe history of Dell Computers is quite famous, with Michael Dell having started the company in his dorm room in 1984. It was the first company to sell personal computers directly to consumers. The company had been performing well until about 1993 when business started to flounder.\n\nThe company's stock fell from $49 to $16 and the CFO had resigned. The problems of the company were due to rapid growth that it could just not keep up with. It had a planned launch of notebook computers that was eventually stopped because of poor production planning. At the time, the company didn't know what product lines its profits and losses were coming from. In essence, its operations were a mess.\n\nWith the companyfalling apart, Dell decided to bring on people with experience. He chose people older than him who had the managerial chops to turn things around. The key hire was Mort Topfer. Though he did not have the title of COO (he was vice chair), he did the job of COO and was Dell's mentor and right-hand man.\n\nAs of Q1 2024, Dell was the second-largest computer company in the world, with a market share of 14.84%.\n\nWhen Topfer came on board he implemented multi-year planning, opened more affordable factories overseas, restructured management, and encouraged Dell to focus on strategy while Topfer would deal with day-to-day operations. The company turned around, becoming a powerhouse.\n\nTopfer joined Dell in 1994 and previously worked at Motorola, heading its land mobile products division. In 2000, his salary at Dell was $700,000 with a bonus of $1.2 million. He also received 290,910stock options.\n\nA CEO is the top-most ranking person at a firm, responsible for the long-term health and direction of the firm, while a COO is the second-highest individual in the firm, reporting to the CEO and responsible for the day-to-day operations of the firm.\n\nCOOs have a strong educational background combined with extensive work experience. A strong COO will have worked in a variety of positions, particularly in a specific organization, to understand all of the different parts of a business and how they work together. This allows them to pinpoint specific issues and gaps within the organization. Having experience managing people and teams is also imperative to be a COO. In addition, COOs should be great communicators, strong leaders, and flexible managers.\n\nThe salary of a COO will vary greatly depending on a variety of factors, including the company they work for, their experience, and their contract. According to PayScale, as of 2024, the average COO salary is $139,156. The base salary ranges from $69,000 to $249,000. On top of that, COOs are paid bonuses andprofit-sharingplans.\n\nA COO is the CEO's right-hand person and the second-highest in command at a firm. The COO is responsible for the day-to-day operations of a firm and for assisting the CEO in a variety of tasks. Not all firms require a COO; however, those that do often benefit from the specific skill set that a COO brings to a company, such as strong analytical, organizational, and communication skills.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \"Second in Command.
