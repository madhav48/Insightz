  "definition": "Madelyn Goodnight / Investopedia\n\nThe Situational Leadership Model suggests that no singleleadership styleis better than another. Instead of focusing on workplace factors, the model suggests that leaders should adjust their techniques to their employees' abilities.\n\nUnder this model, successful leadership is related to both tasks and relationships. It is an adaptive, flexible style in which leaders are encouraged to consider their followers\u2014individuals or a team\u2014and then consider the factors that impact the work environment before choosing how they will lead. This gives them a better chance of meeting their goals.\n\nThe Situational Leadership Model is also called the Hersey-Blanchard Model.\n\nThe situational leadership style was developed by author Paul Hersey and leadership expert Ken Blanchard, author of \u201cThe One Minute Manager.\u201d The model is not a staticleadership style. Instead, it is flexible; the manager adapts their management style to various factors in the workplace, including their relationship with employees.\n\nThat means managers who live by the model must choose aleadershipstyle related to their followers\u2019 maturity. For example, if an employee\u2019s maturity is high, the model suggests the leader provide minimal guidance. By contrast, if their maturity is low, the manager may need to provide explicit directions and supervise work closely to ensure the group has clarity on their goals\u2014and how they are expected to achieve them.\n\nThe maturity level of followers is divided into four categories:\n\nBecause the Situational Leadership Model depends on a leader\u2019s decision-making skills, it uses an individualistic rather than a group approach.\n\nHersey and Blanchard developed four types of leadership styles based on the tasks and relationships that leaders experience in the workplace. According to the model, the following are styles of leadership that managers can use:\n\nThis leadership method letsexecutives, managers, or people in other positions of authority take charge of their followers based on the acumen, understanding, and context of the group.\n\nBy considering how the employees\u2019 characteristics can affect a project\u2019s performance and outcomes, leaders can apply an appropriate structure and degree of control to achieve the desired result.\n\nThere are limitations to the model that may be beyond the leader\u2019s control. The position and authority of the leader may be restricted by the operational chain of command for an organization, which could force them to adopt rigid styles, rather than adapt to follower maturity.\n\nTime constraints, a narrow field of options, and limits on available assets can also force managers to act based on their circumstances, eliminating the possibility of enacting strategies built around follower maturity.\n\nAlthough this leadership model may be sound in theory, it may not necessarily apply in every situation. There are advantages and disadvantages to this approach.\n\nOne advantage of an adaptive leadership style is that leaders can change anytime. Second, employees may find a leader who adapts to shifts in the workforce as a desirable trait.\n\nIt is also a simple and easy-to-apply leadership style, meaning a manager can quickly evaluate a situation and decide how to act as they see fit.\n\nOn the downside, situational leadership may put too much responsibility on the manager, whose decisions may be flawed. Additionally, the model may not work well in certainwork cultures,industries, orsectors.\n\nLastly, there is a chance that this model might prioritize relationships and tasks instead of a company\u2019s long-term goals. A manager should be mindful of this when following this approach.\n\nThe Situational Leadership Model focuses on adapting your management style to the maturity level of the employees you\u2019re addressing. Most importantly, this model of leadership is relationship-oriented; leaders should understand their employees' state of mind, skills, and abilities to determine how best to direct them.\n\nThe four maturity levels are low, moderate low, moderate high, and high maturity. Depending on the employee\u2019s maturity, a manager can choose from among four styles of leadership\u2014telling, selling, participating, and delegating.\n\nSituational leadership is adapting your style of leadership based on who you manage and assign tasks to and the situation.\n\nThe Situational Leadership Model was proposed by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard in 1996 as a way to guide leaders to more effective leadership, based on situations and people. Because employees work and mature professionally\u2014or not\u2014the theory suggests that they may respond better to different levels of guidance, supervision, and instruction.\n\nThe theory behind the model is based on using different approaches with employees according to their abilities, willingness to work, knowledge, and experience.",
