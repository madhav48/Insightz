  "definition": "Erika Rasure is globally-recognized as a leading consumer economics subject matter expert, researcher, and educator. She is a financial therapist and transformational coach, with a special interest in helping women learn how to invest.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\n\"Homogeneous expectations\" refers to the assumption, expressed inHarry Markowitz'sModern Portfolio Theory(MPT), that all investors have the same expectations and make the same choices in a given situation.\n\nMPT, pioneered by\u00a0Harry Markowitz\u00a0in his 1952 paper \"Portfolio Selection,\" is a Nobel prize award-winning theory. It is an investment model designed to maximizereturnswhile taking the lowest possiblerisk\u2014MPT assumes that all investors arerisk-averseand that risk is an inherent part of higher reward.\n\nMarkowitz argued that the solution is constructing a portfolio of multiple assets.When assets considered to be high-risk, such as small-cap stocks, are placed alongside others, theirrisk profilechanges, balancing everything out because eachasset classacts differently during amarket cycle.\n\nAccording to the theory, there are four steps involved in the construction of a portfolio:\n\nHomogeneous expectations are a core principle of MPT. It basically assumes all investors have the same expectations regarding inputs used to developefficient portfolios, including asset returns,variances, andcovariances.\n\nAccording to homogeneous expectations, if investors are shown several investment plans with different returns at a particular risk, they will choose the plan that boasts the highest return. Alternatively, if investors are shown plans that have different risks but the same returns, they will choose the plan that has the lowest risk.\n\nAs you can see here, the homogeneous expectations assumption works on the theory that investors are rational actors. They all think alike and are not influenced by anything but the facts of the matter at hand. This is also an underlying assumption of manyclassical economictheories.\n\nMarkowitz\u2019s MPT and homogeneous expectations theory have revolutionized investing strategies, emphasizing the importance of investment portfolios, risk, and the relationships between securities anddiversification.\n\nMany investors avoid attempting totime the market, preferring instead to buy securities and then hold onto them over the long-term, known as thebuy and holdstrategy. The balanced asset allocation approach, championed for Markowitz, has helped guide them to build robust portfolios.\n\nMPT has also attracted plenty of backlashes. Making assumptions is always dangerous and homogeneous expectations make plenty of them.\n\nThe theory posits that markets are alwaysefficientand that investors all think alike. Studies inbehavioral financehave questioned that premise, arguing that people and investors are not always rational and have different perceptions and goals that impact their thought processes.\n\nMPT categorizes investors as the same, suggesting that all of them want to maximize returns without taking on unnecessary risk, understand expected returns, do not factor incommissionswhen making decisions, and have access to the same information. History has shown that this is not always the case, questioning the validity of MPT and its core tenet: the notion of homogeneous expectations.\n\nThe Nobel Prize. \"Prize in Economic Science 1990.\" Accessed May 5, 2021.",
