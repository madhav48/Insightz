  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nMichela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nThe designation of certified financial planner (CFP) is awarded by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards to recognize expertise in various fields of financial planning.\n\nIf you\u2019ve considered getting financial advice, you\u2019ve likely come across the acronym CFP. But what does it mean?\u00a0A certified financial planner (CFP) acts as your personal financial coach, and they have serious credentials to back up their expertise.\n\nTo become a CFP, a person has to complete a course of study and then pass a two-part, rigorous examination that covers wealth management,\u00a0tax planning, insurance, retirement planning, estate planning, and other crucial personal finance topics. Awarded by the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, the CFP designation also means holders must do a significant amount of continuing education each year to keep up their skills\u2014or they risk losing the certification.\n\nBelow, we\u2019ll unpack what it takes to earn the CFP designation, exploring the required education, experience, and ethical obligations.\n\nA CFP professional is a financial advisor who has earned certification to provide financial planning services to individuals. This can include creating personalized plans for investments, retirement, insurance, education financing, tax strategies, and estate planning. One of the most significant aspects of a CFP\u2019s role is their commitment to act as afiduciary, always prioritizing their client\u2019s best interests.\n\nCFPs are supposed to take a holistic approach to financial planning. They begin by thoroughly evaluating a client\u2019s entire financial picture. This includes assessing income, assets (such as investments and property), and liabilities (like mortgages or student loans). Based on this detailed assessment and the client\u2019s specific goals, they develop a tailored financial plan.\n\nFor example, they might help clients nearing retirement formulate a strategy to generate sustainable income. Or they might help a young family create a savings plan to fund their children\u2019s future college education.\n\nThe cornerstone of the CFP designation is committing to a fiduciary duty toward one\u2019s clients. This means that all CFPs are legally obligated to place their client\u2019s interests above their own when providing financial advice. For example, if a CFP would receive a higher commission by recommending one investment product over another, but the lower-commission product is a better fit for the client\u2019s needs, they are ethically and legally required to recommend the better-fitting product with the lower commission.\n\nWhile many are surprised to learn this, this isn\u2019t always\u2014and often isn\u2019t\u2014the case with other financial professionals likestockbrokers.\n\nHere\u2019s how the CFP Board defines this duty: \u201cAt all times when providing financial advice to a client, a CFP professional must act as a fiduciary, and therefore, act in the best interest of the client.\u201d This encompasses three primary responsibilities:\n\nIn November 2024, in line with most recent years, just 62% of those who had the experience and coursework to take the CFP exam passed.\n\nEarning the CFP designation is a challenging but rewarding process that signifies a high level of competence in financial planning. Becoming a CFP involves meeting stringent requirements in four key areas: education, examination, experience, and ethics.\n\nThe first step toward becoming a CFP is meeting the education guidelines. Candidates must hold a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher from an accredited college or university. This degree can be in any field, but candidates must also complete specific coursework in financial planning, as set out by the CFP Board. This coursework typically covers a comprehensive range of topics:\n\nThe CFP Board maintains a list of qualifying educational programs. It\u2019s essential to ensure that your coursework meets their requirements to avoid delays in your certification journey.\n\nSome coursework is typically waived if the aspiring CFP holds other financial designations, such as a chartered financial analyst (CFA) or certified public accountant (CPA) designation, or has a higher degree in business, such as amaster of business administration (MBA).\n\nIn addition to formal education, aspiring CFPs must gain substantial real-world experience in financial planning. Candidates must have at least three years, or 6,000 hours, of full-time professional experience in the industry, or two years (4,000 hours) in an apprenticeship role.\n\nThis experience can be gained through various roles, such as working at a financial planning firm, bank, brokerage, or insurance company. The key is that the experience must involve delivering financial planning services directly to clients or supporting the financial planning process in a meaningful way. The apprenticeship pathway requires meeting more structured experience requirements, such as being under the direct supervision of a CFP.\n\nThe CFP Board has final discretion whether to award the CFP designation.\n\nApplicants must prove their commitment to acting in the best interest of clients by doing the following:\n\nTheCFP examincludes 170 multiple-choice questions covering 100 topics related to financial planning such as regulations, financial planning principles, education planning, risk management, insurance, investments, tax planning, retirement planning, and estate planning.\n\nTopic areas are weighted and available on theCFP Board website. Further questions test the candidate\u2019s expertise in establishing client-planner relationships, gathering relevant information, and analyzing, developing, implementing, and monitoring the recommendations they make to their clients.\n\nAfter becoming a CFP, the homework and studying aren\u2019t over. CFPs must complete 30 hours of continuing education every two years. This is to ensure they stay updated on the latest financial planning rules and strategies.\n\nThough CFPs and chartered financial analysts (CFAs) have designations that are just a letter off, they aredifferent certificationswith different job functions and clients.\n\nCFPs typically work with individual clients. Meanwhile, CFAs are often employed by investment management companies such as mutual funds, hedge funds, and private equity firms. A CFA\u2019s job is to analyze the growth and profitability of companies as well as their creditworthiness and the amount of debt they carry.\n\nIn addition, CFAs are qualified to do personal financial planning and wealth management. As such, like CFPs, they often advise clients on investing given their specific goals, finances, andrisk tolerance.\n\nA CFPhelps individuals manage their finances, investment choices, estate planning, and retirement planning. A CFP is a step above a non-designated financial advisor and has demonstrated expertise in financial planning.\n\nHow much a CFP charges depends on a client\u2019s specific needs. In 2024, CFPs were estimated to charge $1,800 to $2,500 for preparing a full financial plan. Individuals may pay $4,000 for a flat-fee retainer or $250 for hourly services.\n\nNo, a CFP is not the same as an MBA. A CFP is qualified to advise individuals on financial planning. The holders of MBAs have studied how businesses operate\u2014and the quality of their degree differs significantly from one university to the next. Their career paths usually diverge. A CFPworks in consulting or wealth management, while an MBA may be a business manager, portfolio manager, financial analyst, financial strategist, or entrepreneur.\n\nA CFP is a professional invested heavily in becoming an expert you can trust. Behind those three letters are years of education, rigorous testing, real-world experience, and a commitment to putting clients\u2019 interests first.\n\nWhether planning for retirement, saving for your kids\u2019 college, or just trying to make savvier money moves, a CFP brings expertise and the ethical commitment to help guide your financial journey.\n\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards. \u201cThe Standard of Excellence.\u201d\n\nCertified Financial Planner Board of Standards. \u201cWhat Is Fiduciary Duty?
