  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nAn ordinary loss is loss realized by a taxpayer when expenses exceed revenues in normal business operations. Ordinary losses are those losses incurred by a taxpayer that are not capital losses. An ordinary loss is\u00a0fully deductible to offset income, thereby\u00a0reducing\u00a0the tax owed by a taxpayer.\n\nOrdinary losses may stem from many causes, including casualty and theft. When ordinary losses are more than a taxpayer\u2019s gross income during a tax year, they become deductible.\n\nCapital and ordinary are two tax rates applicable to specific asset sales and transactions.\u00a0The tax\u00a0rates are\u00a0tied to a taxpayer\u2019smarginal tax rate. Net long-term capital rates are significantly lower than ordinary rates. Hence the conventional wisdom that taxpayers prefer capital rates on gains and ordinary rates on losses.\n\nIn 2025, the rates will be graduated over seven tax brackets from 10% to\u00a037% for ordinary rates, and from 0% to 20% of net long-term capital rates.Also, taxpayers in the highest tax bracket must pay a 3.8%net investment income tax (NIIT).\n\nAn ordinary loss is a metaphoric wastebasket for any loss that is not classified as acapital loss. The realization of a capital loss happens when you sell a capital asset,\u00a0such as a stock market investment or property you own for personal use, for less than its original cost.\n\nThe recognition of an ordinary loss is when you sell property such as\u00a0inventory, supplies, accounts receivables from doing business, real estate used as rental property, and intellectual property such as musical, literary, software coding, or artistic compositions.\u00a0It is the loss realized by a business owner operating a business that fails to make a profit because expenses exceed revenues.\u00a0The loss\u00a0recognized from property created or available due to a taxpayer\u2019s personal efforts in the course of conducting a trade or business is\u00a0an\u00a0ordinary\u00a0loss.\n\nAs an example, you spend $110 writing a musical score that you sell for $100. You have a $10 ordinary loss.\n\nOrdinary loss can stem from other causes as well. Casualty, theft, andrelated party salesrealize ordinary loss.\u00a0So do\u00a0sales ofSection 1231 property, such as real or depreciable goods\u00a0used in a trade or business that were held for over one year.\n\nTaxpayers like\u00a0their deductible loss to be ordinary. Ordinary loss, on the whole, offers greater tax savings than a long-term capital loss.\n\nAn ordinary loss is mostly\u00a0fully deductible in the year of the loss, whereas capital loss is not.\u00a0An ordinary loss will offset\u00a0ordinary income on a one-to-one basis.\u00a0A capital loss is strictly limited to offsetting a capital gain and up to $3,000 of ordinary income.\u00a0The remaining capital loss must be carried over to another year.\n\nLet\u2019s say that during the tax year, you earned $100,000 and had $80,000 of expenses. You bought stocks and bonds and,\u00a0six months later, sold the stock for $2,000 more\u00a0and bonds for $1,000 less than you paid. Then, the stock market tanked when\u00a0you sold the\u00a0stock and bonds you bought more than a year ago, so you\u00a0sold\u00a0the stock for\u00a0$14,000\u00a0less\u00a0and the bonds for\u00a0$3,000 more than you paid. Let\u2019s net your gains and losses to\u00a0figure your overall\u00a0gain or loss and whether it is ordinary or capital.\n\nAn ordinary loss is fully deductible from taxable income. There are no limits on how much can be deducted.\n\nOrdinary losses are fully deductible in the year losses were incurred and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years. Capital losses exceeding the maximum deductible amount can be carried forward into future years.\n\nA capital loss occurs when a capital asset is sold for less than what it cost. For example, if equipment that cost $10,000 is sold for $8,000, a $2,000 capital loss is incurred. An ordinary loss occurs when business expenses exceed business income, when non-capital assets are sold, or for certain non-capital transactions.\n\nAn ordinary loss is what a taxpayer realizes when expenses exceed revenues in normal business operations. Ordinary losses are not capital losses.\n\nAn ordinary loss is\u00a0fully deductible to offset income, which\u00a0reduces the tax owed by a taxpayer.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Releases Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 409, Capital Gains and Losses.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cQuestions and Answers on the Net Investment Income Tax.\u201d",
