  "term": "Industrialization: What It Is, Examples, and Impacts on Society",
  "definition": "Industrialization is the process of transforming the economy of a nation or region from a focus on agriculture to a reliance on manufacturing. Mechanized methods ofmass productionare an essential component of this transition.\n\nThe positive characteristics of industrialization include economic growth, a more efficient division of labor, and a growth spurt in technological innovation.\n\nIndustrialization can be driven by a combination of factors including government policy, labor-saving inventions, entrepreneurial ambitions, and a demand for goods and services. It has profound implications for the population, causing a wave of migration from small farms to cities and towns where jobs can be found.\n\nThe most dramatic example in recent history is that of China, where government policy changes in the late 20th century led to the nation's transition from an economy based on subsistence farming to aglobal manufacturing powerhouse.\n\nIn the western world, Industrialization is most commonly associated with theIndustrial Revolutionin Europe that began in the late 18th century and the subsequent burst of industrialization in the U.S. through the 19th century.\n\nIn Europe, the era was characterized by a surge in local manufacturing of goods for export, made possible by a growing population of consumers. Great Britain played an outsized role in the process through technological innovations such as steam-powered machinery.\n\nIndustrialization quickly spread to the United States, the epicenter of laissez-faire capitalism. Inventions including the cotton mill and steam power made possible the establishment of mill towns such as Lowell, MA, and Pawtucket, RI.\n\nWorld War II created an unprecedented demand for certain manufactured goods, leading to a buildup of production capacity. Post-war prosperity provided further catalysts that kept capacity utilization high and stimulated further growth.\n\nInnovation, specialization, and wealth creation were the causes and effects of industrialization in this period.\n\nThe late 20th century was marked by rapid industrialization in other parts of the world, notably Asia. The Asian Tigers (Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore) all participated in economic growth based on manufacturing for global customers.\n\nChina experienced its own industrial revolution after moving away from a strict communist model.\n\nThe innovations of the 19th century allowed for the mass production of commercial goods. As manufacturing activities grew, transportation, finance, and communications industries all expanded to support the new production capacity.\n\nIt also led to increased labor specialization and allowed cities to support larger populations, motivating a rapid demographic shift. People left rural areas in large numbers, seeking jobs in budding industries.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution led to unprecedented expansion in wealth and financial well-being for some. A larger middle class emerged as consumer demand for more goods and services grew and business creation boomed to feed the demand.\n\nDifferent strategies and methods of industrialization have been followed over time, with varyingdegrees of success.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States initially took place undermercantilistandprotectionistgovernment policies that fostered the early growth of industry. These later adopted alaissez-faireorfree-marketapproach that encouraged foreign trade, providing new outlets for industrial output.\n\nIn the post-Second World War era, developing nations across Latin America and Africa adopted a strategy ofimport-substituting industrialization, which involved protectionist barriers to trade coupled with direct subsidization or nationalization of domestic industries.\n\nNearly at the same time, parts of Europe and several East Asian economies pursued an alternative strategy ofexport-led growth. This strategy emphasized the deliberate pursuit of foreign trade to build exporting industries and depended in part on maintaining a weak currency to make exports more attractive to foreign buyers.\n\nIn general, export-led growth has outperformed import-substituting industrialization.\n\nThe socialist nations of the 20th century repeatedly embarked on centrally planned programs of industrialization. These include the first and second five-year plans in the Soviet Union and theGreat Leap Forwardin China.\n\nWhile these efforts did re-orient the respective economies toward a more industrial base and an increase in output of industrial commodities, they were also accompanied by harsh government repression, deteriorating living and working conditions for workers, and even widespread starvation.\n\nIndustrialization is dependent on growth and innovation in at least four industries.\n\nIndustrialization began with the invention of machines that greatly increased the manufacture of goods.\n\nOne such invention was the cotton gin, patented by Eli Whitney in 1794. Whether hand-cranked or steam-powered, the machine made it possible to greatly increase the speed with which cotton fluff could be separated from its seeds before being woven into cloth.\n\nAnother was the spinning jenny, a contraption that could multiply the number of spindles that a single spinner could handle at the same time to weave cotton or wool.\n\nPerhaps the key invention of them all was the steam engine, an improved version of which was invented by Scottish engineer James Watt in 1763. Coal-powered steam engines drove the Industrial Revolution.\n\nMany of the great inventions of the 19th century were developed to serve the mining industry.\n\nThe 19th century was a period of unparalleled innovation in ways to transport goods from and to marketplaces. Among them:\n\nBefore contactless payments and self-service checkouts, there were innovations in retailing that were designed to appeal to 19th century shoppers.\n\nIndustrialization creates jobs that draw people from farms and villages to cities where manufacturing takes place. However hard those jobs were, they were often preferable to the precarious existence of a small farming family.\n\nThe result is a new generation of urban consumers. Businesses of all kinds spring up to provide goods and services to these consumers. Over time, a larger middle class of artisans and shopkeepers emerges.\n\nA large working class also emerges, and conditions were often much harsher for them. The evolution of labor unions is a direct result of the conditions faced by the powerless workers of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nIndustrial activity is any business process that is necessary to create a manufactured product. The activity may be related to the sourcing, processing, assembly, repair, or dismantling of a manufactured product.\n\nNon-industrial may be most often seen in zoning regulations or discussions regarding zoning regulations.\n\nThis is a wide category that may include everything except manufacturing activities and manufacturing sourcing such as mining.\n\nNon-industrial land use includes retail and services businesses, entertainment and recreation sites, parking lots, and residential neighborhoods.\n\nFor better or worse, industrialization created the modern world as we know it. You would have to search far and wide to find a place on Earth that has not been affected by industrialization, and those places probably will be soon.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution in Europe and the United States brought the world into the modern era. Other regions, particularly in Asia, made the transition later. The process continues into the 21st century.\n\nClemson University. \"Chapter 36, The Industrial Revolution and STS.\"Science Technology and Society a Student Led Exploration.
