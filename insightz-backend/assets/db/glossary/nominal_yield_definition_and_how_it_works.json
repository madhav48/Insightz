  "term": "Nominal Yield: Definition and How it Works",
  "definition": "A bond's nominal yield, depicted as a percentage, is calculated by dividing total interest paid annually by the face, orpar, value of the bond.\n\nThe nominal yield is the coupon rate on a bond. Essentially, it is the interest rate that the bondissuerpromises to pay bond purchasers. This rate is fixed and it applies to the life of the bond. Sometimes it's also referred to as nominal rate or coupon yield.\n\nThe nominal yield does not always represent the current yield because it's a percentage based on the bond's par value, and not the actual price that was paid to buy that bond. Buyers who pay a premium that's more than the face value for a given bond will receive a lower actualrate of return(RoR) than the nominal yield, while investors who pay a discount that's less than the face value will receive a higher actual rate of return. It's also worth noting that bonds with highcoupon ratestend to get called first\u2014when callable\u2014because they represent the issuer's greatest liability relative to bonds with lower yields.\n\nTake, for example, a bond with a face value of $1,000 that pays the bondholder $50 in interest payments annually. It would have a nominal yield of 5% (50/1000).\n\nBonds are issued by governments for domestic spending purposes or by corporations to raise funds for financing research and development and forcapital expenditure (CapEx). At the time of issuance, an investment banker acts as an intermediary between the bond issuer\u2014which might be a corporation\u2014and the bond buyer. Two components combine to determine the nominal yield on a debt instrument: the prevailing rate of inflation and the credit risk of the issuer.\n\nFederal Reserve Board of St. Louis, FRED. \"3-Month Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis.\"",
