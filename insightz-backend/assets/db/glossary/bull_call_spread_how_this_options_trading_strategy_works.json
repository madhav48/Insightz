  "term": "Bull Call Spread: How This Options Trading Strategy Works",
  "definition": "A bull call spread is a type of options trading strategy that involves two call options. A bull call strategy is executed by purchasing call options at a specific strike or exercise price while also selling the same number of calls of the same asset at a higher strike price. It should be noted that both options should have the same expiration date.\n\nThis type of strategy is used when the trader expects a moderate rise in the price of an underlying asset.\n\nThe goal of a bull call spread is to profit from a moderate increase in the price of theunderlying asset.\n\nIf the price of the underlying asset rises moderately and is near or above the higher strike or exercise price at expiration, the strategy will reach its maximum profit. However, if the price falls or does not rise significantly, the strategy will incur a loss, which is limited to the net premium paid to establish the spread.\n\nConstructing a bull call spread involves the following steps:\n\nIt should be noted that the maximum profit in a bull call spread is limited to the difference between the strike price of the two call options, less thenet premiumpaid. The maximum loss is limited to the net premium paid to establish the spread.\n\nHere is an example of a bull call spread. It should be noted that this example does not take into account transaction costs or taxes, which can affect the profitability of the strategy.\n\nA trader has identified the underlying asset as a stock called ABC. ABC is currently trading at $50, and the trader thinks that the stock will rise moderately over the next month. The trader then decides to set up a bull call spread to profit from this expected price increase.\n\nThe trader will buy a call option with a strike price of $50 that expires in a month\u2019s time. This is called anat-the-money optionbecause the strike price is equivalent to the current trading price. The premium or cost of this option is $3 per share for 100 shares.\n\nSimultaneously, the trader sells a call option on the same stock with a strike price of $55 that also expires in one month with a cost of $2 per share for 100 shares. This option is called an out-of-the-money option because the strike price of the call is higher than the current trading price of the underlying asset.\n\nThis trader has now put together a bull call spread with the initial values:\n\nThe maximum loss is the net premium paid for the options. The formula for the maximum loss of a bull call spread is as follows:\n\nSince each options contract represents 100 shares, the total maximum loss would be:\n\nThe maximum gain is the difference between the strike prices of the two options minus the net premium paid. The formula for the maximum gain of a bull call spread is as follows:\n\nPlugging in the values results in the following:\n\nSince the options are for 100 shares, multiply the gain by 100. The total maximum gain would be $400.\n\nThe breakeven price is the market price an asset needs to reach for the spread to return the money spent. The formula to breakeven is:\n\nSo, the stock would need to rise to $51 by the expiration date for the trader to break even.\n\nInvestors can realize limited gains from an upward move in an asset\u2019s price\n\nA bull call spread is cheaper than buying only an individual call option\n\nThe bullish call spread limits the maximum loss of owning an asset to the net cost of the strategy\n\nThe investor forfeits any gains in the asset\u2019s price above the strike of the sold call option\n\nGains are limited given the net cost of the premiums for the two call options\n\nAs it relates to a bull call spread, the effect of volatility is somewhat neutralized. This is due to the result of buying and selling call options on the same underlying asset with the same expiration date.\n\nWhen volatility rises, the price of both options tends to increase. This means that the value of the long call option would increase, but at the same time, the value of the short call option would also increase. Given that this options trading strategy is long one option and short another option, the effects of a change in volatility on both options can offset each other to a large extent.\n\nIn the language of options, this is often referred to as a \u201cnear-zero vega.\u201dVega measures the sensitivityof an option\u2019s price to changes in volatility. A near-zero vega implies that the price of the bull call spread changes very little when volatility changes, assuming other factors remain constant.\n\nIt should be noted that the bull call spread is not completely immune to changes in volatility. The exact impact can depend on other factors, including how far the options are in or out of the money, and how much time is left until expiration.\n\nThe impact of time on a bull call spread, also known astime decayor theta, is complex because the strategy involves two options: a long call and a short call. Both of these options have different responses to the passage of time.\n\nThe time value portion of an option\u2019s total price decreases as expiration approaches. But the overall impact of time decay on a bull call spread is dependent on the relationship of the stock price to the strike prices of the spread.\n\nIf the stock price is halfway between the strike prices, then time erosion has little effect on the price of a bull call spread because both the long call option and the short call option decay at approximately the same rate.\n\nFor the long call option in a bull call spread, time decay is detrimental. As time passes, all else being equal, the value of the option that is bought decreases. This is because the option has less time to make a profitable move, thus it is less valuable.\n\nIf the stock price is near or below the strike price of thelong call option\u2014the call option with the lower strike price\u2014then the price of the bull call spread decreases with the passing of time and would, therefore, lose money. This happens because the long call is closest to the money and decreases in value faster than the short call option.\n\nFor the short call option in a bull call spread, time decay works in favor of the trader. As time passes, the option that was sold decreases in value, which is beneficial because the trader has the obligation under that option. If the short call option expires worthless, the trader keeps the entire premium received from selling it.\n\nHowever, if the stock price is near or above the strike price of the short call option\u2014the call option with the higher strike price\u2014then the price of the bull call spread increases with the passage of time and would, therefore, make money. This happens because the short call option is closer to the money and decreases in value faster than the long call.\n\nThe price change of the underlying asset has a significant impact on a bull call spread. A bull call spread strategy profits when the price of the underlying asset rises.\n\nIf the price of the underlying asset rises significantly and is above the strike price of the short call option at expiration, the strategy reaches its maximum profit. This is because the long call option increases in value, while the short call option is offset by the increase in the underlying asset\u2019s price.\n\nOn another note, if the price of the underlying rises moderately and is between the strike prices of the long call option and short call option at expiration, the strategy will still profit, but not as much as in the scenario above. The long call option increases in value, but the short call option also starts to gain in value, which reduces the overall profit.\n\nFinally, if the price of the underlying asset falls or does not rise significantly, the bull call spread strategy will incur a net loss. If the price is below the strike price of the long call option at expiration, both options would expire worthless, and the loss is limited to the net premium paid to establish the spread.\n\nTraders consider several other factors. These include:\n\nIt should be noted that while bull call spreads can limit risk, as the maximum possible loss is the initial cost of the spread, they also cap potential profits. Traders should weigh these factors and consider their risk tolerance and market outlook before employing this strategy.\n\nAbull put spreadis a different bull spread, where the trader sells one put option and buys another. In a bull put spread, the trader collects the premium upfront, hoping to keep the profits when the options expire, unlike in a bull call spread, where the trader pays a premium hoping to profit when the options expire. Both strategies are moderately bullish, the only major difference being that the bull put spread is a credit strategy while the bull call spread is a debit strategy.\n\nThe bull call spread loses money if the underlying asset doesn\u2019t increase in value. Additionally, the gains are capped at the difference between the strike prices minus the net premium paid, as any additional increase in value from the long call is offset by losses from the short call.\n\nA trader can sell the spread to another trader for more than the net premium for a profit if options prices cooperate. Otherwise, time decay can devalue a spread, so some traders close their spreads about 30 days before expiration.\n\nA bull call spread is an options trading strategy used when a trader expects a moderate rise in the price of an underlying asset. It involves buying a call option at a specific strike or exercise price and selling another call option on the same asset at a higher strike price, both with the same expiration date. The goal is to profit from a moderate price increase, with the maximum profit achieved when the asset\u2019s price is at or above the higher strike price at expiration.\n\nThis strategy also caps potential losses to the net premium paid. When using a bull call spread, traders should consider factors such as the risk of early assignment, the impact of dividends, transaction costs, market conditions, the choice of expiration date, and the selection of strike prices. The effects of changes in the underlying asset\u2019s price, volatility, and time decay also play a crucial role in the strategy\u2019s outcome.\n\nCorrection\u2014Oct. 3, 2024: This article has been corrected to state that a bull put spread is a credit strategy while a bull call spread is a debit strategy.\n\nOptions Industry Council. \"Bull Call Spread (Debit Call Spread).\"\n\nOptions Industry Council. \"Bull Put Spread (Credit Put Spread).\"",
