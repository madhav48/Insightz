  "term": "Upstream Guarantee: What it is, How it Works",
  "definition": "An upstream guarantee, also known as a subsidiary guarantee, is afinancial guaranteein which the subsidiary guarantees its parent company's debt.\n\nAn upstream guarantee can be contrasted with adownstream guarantee, which is a pledge placed on a loan on behalf of the borrowing party by the borrowing party's parent company or stockholder.\n\nUpstream guarantees enable a parent company to obtain debt financing on better financing terms, by expanding the available collateral. They often occur inleveraged buy-outs, when the parent company does not have enough assets to pledge as collateral.\n\nA payment guaranty obligates theguarantorto pay the debt should the borrower default, regardless of whether the lender makes a demand on the borrower. Alternatively, a collection guaranty only obligates the guarantor if the lender cannot collect the amount owed after bringing a lawsuit and exhausting its remedies against the borrower. Guaranties can be absolute, limited or conditional.\n\nTypically, a lender will insist on an upstream guaranty when it lends to a parent whose only asset is stock ownership of a subsidiary. In this case, the subsidiary owns substantially all the assets upon which the lender bases its credit decision.\n\nThe problem with upstream guarantees is that lenders are exposed to the risk of being sued forfraudulent conveyancewhen the guarantor is insolvent or without adequate capital at the time it executed the guarantee. If the issue of fraudulent conveyance is successfully proved in a\u00a0bankruptcy court, the lender would become anunsecured creditor, clearly a bad outcome for the lender.\n\nSince the subsidiary guaranteeing the debt payments owns no stock in the parent company borrowing the funds, the former does not directly receive any benefits from the loan proceeds and, hence, does not receive a reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee provided.\n\nAn upstream guarantee, like a downstream guarantee in which the parent company guarantees the subsidiary company\u2019s debt, does not have to be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. However, it is disclosed as acontingent liability, including any provisions that might enable the guarantor to recover funds paid out in a guarantee.\n\nA downstream guarantee can be undertaken in order to help a subsidiary company obtain debt financing that it otherwise would be unable to obtain, or to obtain funds atinterest ratesthat would be lower than it could obtain without the guarantee from its parent company.\n\nIn many instances, a lender may be willing to provide \ufb01nancing to a corporate borrower only if an af\ufb01liate agrees to guarantee the loan. This is because, once backed by the financial strength of the holding company, the subsidiary company'srisk of defaultingon its debt is considerably less. The guarantee is similar to one individual cosigning for another on a loan.",
