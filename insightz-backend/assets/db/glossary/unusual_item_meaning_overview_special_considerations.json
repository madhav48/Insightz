  "term": "Unusual Item: Meaning, Overview, Special Considerations",
  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nAn unusual item is a nonrecurring or one-time gain or loss that is not considered part of normal business operations. Unusual gains or losses may berecorded on the income statementas a separate component of income from continuing operations, or alternatively, may be identified in thefootnotesto the financial statements or the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report.\n\nReporting unusual items separately is important to ensure the transparency of financial reporting. Because unusual items are unlikely to recur, separating these items \u2014 either explicitly on anincome statementor in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) or footnotes \u2014 allows investors to better assess the income-generating capacity of the core business activities.\n\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the independent nonprofit organization responsible for issuing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), has given management leeway to provide a more descriptive separate line item on the income statement when appropriate, such as \"Loss from Hurricane Damages to Office Building.\"\n\nThe treatment of unusual items has several implications related to the analysis of company performance and valuation of its shares, credit agreements, and executive compensation schemes. An analyst would have to make adjustments to the income statement to produce a \"clean\"EBIT,EBITDA, and net income figures on which to calculateprice multiples. Debt agreements would have to specify the exclusions to how certain covenants are calculated. Executive pay plans, too, would need to explain how unusual items are handled in compensation formulas.",
