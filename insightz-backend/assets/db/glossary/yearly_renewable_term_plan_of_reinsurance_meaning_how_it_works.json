  "definition": "The yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance is a\u00a0type of life reinsurance where mortality risks of an insurance company are transferred to areinsurerthrough a process referred to ascession.\n\nIn the yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance, the primary insurer (the ceding company) yields to a reinsurer itsnet amount at riskfor the amount that is greater than theretentionlimit on a life insurance policy.\n\nThis plan is areinsuranceinstantiation of ayearly renewable term(YRT), which consists of one-year term policies that are renewed annually.\n\nReinsurance allows insurance companies to reduce the financial risks associated with insurance claims by spreading some of the risk to another institution.Therefore, a yearly renewable term plan of reinsurance allows the primary insurance company to spread some of the risk involved in alife insurancepolicy to another institution.\n\nThe amount transferred from the primary insurer to the reinsurer is the net amount at risk, which is the difference between the face value and the acceptable retention limit determined by the ceding insurance company. For example, if a policy's death benefit is $200,000, and the ceding company determines the retention limit to be $105,000, then the net amount at risk is equal to $95,000. If the insured dies, the reinsurance pays the portion of the death benefit that is equal to the net amount of risk\u2014in this case, the amount above and beyond $105,000.\n\nWhen setting up a reinsurance agreement, the ceding company will prepare a schedule of the net amount at risk for each policy year. The net amount at risk on a life insurance policy decreases over time as the insured pays premiums, which adds to its accrued cash value.\n\nFor example, consider awhole life insurancepolicy issued for a face value of $100,000. At the time of issue, the entire $100,000 is at risk, but as its cash value accumulates, it functions as areserveaccount, which reduces the net amount at risk for the insurance company. Therefore, if the cash value of the insurance policy rises to $60,000 by its 30th year, the net amount at risk is then $40,000.\n\nOnce the ceding company calculates the net amount at risk each year, the reinsurer develops a schedule of yearly renewable termpremiumsfor reinsurance based on this schedule. The reinsurance premiums paid by the ceding company vary based on the policyholder's age, plan, and policy year.The premiums are renewed yearly under the renewable term reinsurance policy.If a claim is filed, the reinsurer would remit payment for the assumed portion of the policy's net amount at risk.\n\nYearly renewable term (YRT) reinsurance is typically used to reinsure traditional whole life insurance anduniversal life insurance. Term insurance wasn't always reinsured on a YRT basis. This was so becausecoinsurancemade for a better match of reinsurance costs with premiums received from the policyholder on level premium term products. It also passed the risk of the adequacy rates along to the reinsurer. However, as alternative capital solutions have become more popular, YRT became a more popular method of reinsuring term insurance as well.\n\nYRT is usually the best choice when the goal is to transfer mortality risk because a policy is large or because of concerns overclaimfrequency. YRT is also simple to administer and popular in situations where the anticipated number of reinsurance cessions is low.\n\nYRT is also good for reinsuringdisability income, long-term care, and critical illness risks. However, it does not work as well for reinsurance ofannuities.\n\nSince YRT reinsurance only involves a limited amount of investment risk, little persistency risk, no cash surrender risk, and little or no surplus strain, reinsurers may have a lower profit objective for YRT reinsurance. YRT can thus usually be had at a lower effective cost than either coinsurance or modified coinsurance.\u00a0As long as annual premiums are paid, the reserve credit is equal to the unearned portion of the net premium of a one-year term insurance benefit. Yearly renewable term insurance normally does not provide reinsurance ceded reserve credit for deficiency reserves.\n\nAmerican Council of Life Insurers. \"Reinsurance,\" Page 58.\n\nNational Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). \"Reinsurance.\"",
