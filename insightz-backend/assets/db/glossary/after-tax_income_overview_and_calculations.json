  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAfter-tax income is the net income after deducting all federal, state, and withholding taxes. After-tax income\u2014also called income after taxes and thenet of tax amount\u2014represents the amount of disposable income that a consumer or firm has available to spend.\n\nMost individual tax filers use some version of theIRS Form 1040to calculate their taxable income, income tax due, and after-tax income.To calculate after-tax income, the deductions are subtracted from gross income. The difference is the taxable income, on which income taxes are due. After-tax income is the difference between gross income and the income tax due.\n\nConsider the following example: Abi Sample earns $30,000\u00a0and claims $10,000 in deductions, resulting in a taxable income of $20,000. Theirfederal income tax rateis 15%, making the income tax due $3,000. The after-tax income is $27,000, or the difference between gross earnings and income tax ($30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000).\n\nIndividuals can also account for state and local taxes when calculating after-tax income. When doing this, sales tax and property taxes are also excluded\u00a0from gross income. Continuing with the above example, Abi Sample pays $1,000 in state income tax and $500 in municipal income tax resulting in an after-tax income of $25,500 ($27,000 - $1500 = $25,500).\n\nWhen analyzing orforecastingpersonal or corporate cash flows, it is essential to use an estimated after-taxnet cashprojection. This\u00a0estimate is a more appropriate measure than pretax income orgross incomebecause after-tax cash flows are what the entity has available for consumption.\n\nComputing after-tax income for businesses is relatively the same as for individuals. However, instead of determining gross income, enterprises begin by defining total revenues. Business expenses,\u00a0as recorded on the income statement, are subtracted from total revenues producing the firm's income. Finally, any other relevant deductions are subtracted\u00a0to arrive at\u00a0taxable income.\n\nThe difference between the total revenues and the business expenses and deductions is the taxable income, on which taxes will be due. The difference between the business's income and the income tax due is the after-tax income.\n\nThe terms after-tax and pretax income often refer to retirement contributions or other benefits. For example, if someone makes pretax contributions to aretirement account, those contributions are subtracted from their gross pay.After deductions are made to the gross salary amount, the employer will calculate\u00a0payroll taxes.\n\nMedicare contributions and Social Security payments are calculated on the difference after these deductions are taken from\u00a0the gross salary amount. However, if the employee makes after-tax contributions to a retirement account, the employer applies taxes to the employee's gross pay and then subtracts the retirement contributions from that amount.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1040.\" Accessed April 22, 2021.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Retirement Topics - Contributions.\" Accessed April 22, 2021.",
