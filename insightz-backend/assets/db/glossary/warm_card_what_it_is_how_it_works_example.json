It is given to an employee who needs to have limited access to a company's financial accounts. Typically, these cards allow deposits but not withdrawals. This allows the employees to make transactions while reducing the risk of theft.\n\nWarm cards are used by businesses that want to minimize their risk offraudor theft. Employees whose job descriptions require them to make bankdepositscan be given warm cards that allow them only the access needed to complete their duties. By blocking withdrawals, warm cards eliminate the risk of theft by employees.\n\nBusinesses also have access to other security measures, such as the use ofmulti-factor authenticationor complex passwords. As the scale of online fraud continues to grow, businesses are increasingly turning to a mixed approach in which they combine these online methods with physical measures such as the use of warm cards.\n\nWarm cards are distinct fromdebit cardsin that the latter generally allow for both deposits and withdrawals. Another difference between them is that debit cards are used by both business and individual bank customers, whereas warm cards are specific to business customers. Debit cards also permit transfers between accounts, but warm cards are limited to specified accounts.\n\nAs online fraud has increased, businesses have had to combine physical measures such as using warm cards, with other security measures like multi-factor authentication orcomplicated passwords.\n\nTo illustrate how warm cards work, say you are the owner of a chain of coffee shops. Altogether, your company has five locations and 15 employees. Each location has a store manager whose responsibilities include depositing the cash received from customers at the end of each week.\n\nAs part of yourinternal controls, you issue warm cards to each of five store managers. Each of these cards is connected to a company bank account set up to hold the cash from customers. When the store managers present their cards, the bank tellers know that they are authorized to deposit cash into the company account. At the same time, the warm cards don't permitwithdrawalsor transfers to be made, so they effectively insure against the risk of fraud or theft.\n\nUnlike credit cards, the warm cards don't impart any borrowing capacity to the user. Therefore, you don't need to record anyliabilityassociated with these cards, and you doesn't need to be concerned with thecreditworthinessof the employees using them. Similarly, the employees know that using warm cards won't affect their personalcredit scores.\n\nWarm cards are also sometimes called \"deposit-only\" cards by banks and the business customers who use them.\n\nWarm cards come with two key benefits: fraud protection and convenience. Because warm cards let employees to make deposits into business accounts but restrict access to the ability to spend with them, the employees won\u2019t be able to commit fraud by withdrawing money they shouldn\u2019t or using a business card to make personal purchases. In terms of convenience, with warm cards, a variety of employees can handle deposits and relieve the owner of that task.\n\nWarm cards are relatively easy to obtain from financial institutions that provide them. Usually, you have three options for requesting a warm card: 1) Go to the bank branch and ask for one. It typically takes a few business days for the card to be shipped to you. 2) You also can call your bank to request a warm card. 3) Or most financial institutions offer mobile banking apps. Those offering warm cards should make it easy to access these restricted cards\u00a0through their app.\n\nA warm, or deposit-only, card is a bank card used by businesses to let employees to make deposits in the business's financial accounts. Unlike debit cards, warm cards typically only allow the employee to make deposits, while prohibiting them from making withdrawals. Warm cards are used by companies to enable their employees to make necessary transactions, while reducing or eliminating the risk of theft or fraud. They also can increase convenience for owners by allowing them to delegate cash deposits to employees without concern about fraud or theft.\n\nRamp. \"The Benefits of Using a Warm Card for Your Small Business.\"",
