  "term": "B2C: How Business-to-Consumer Sales Works, Types, and Examples",
  "definition": "The term business-to-consumer (B2C) refers to the process of selling products and services directly between a business and consumers who are the end-users of its products or services. Most companies that sell directly to consumers can be referred to as B2C companies.\n\nB2C became immensely popular during thedotcomboom of the late 1990s when it was mainly used to refer to online retailers who sold products and services to consumers through the internet.\n\nAs a business model, business-to-consumer differs significantly from thebusiness-to-business(B2B) model, which refers to commerce between two or more businesses.\n\nBusiness-to-consumer (B2C) is among the most popular and widely known sales models. Michael Aldrich first utilized the idea of B2C in 1979 and used television as the primary medium to reach out to consumers.\n\nB2C traditionally referred to mall shopping, eating out at restaurants, pay-per-view movies, and infomercials. However, the rise of the internet created a whole new B2C business channel in the form ofe-commerceor selling goods and services over the internet.\n\nAlthough many B2C companies fell victim to the subsequent dotcom bust as investor interest in the sector dwindled and venture capital funding dried up, B2C leaders such as Amazon\u00a0and Priceline\u00a0survived the shakeout and have since seen tremendous success.\n\nAny business that relies on B2C sales must maintain good relations with itscustomersto ensure they return. The company mustregularly review its marketingfor good performance and adjust it when necessary.\n\nBusiness-to-business (B2B) marketing campaigns are geared to demonstrate the value of a product or service. Companies that rely on B2C usuallytry to catch the eye of the consumerand elicit an emotional response to their marketing.\n\nTraditionally, many manufacturers sold their products to retailers with physical locations. Retailers made profits on the markup they added to the price paid to the manufacturer. But that changed once theinternetcame. New businesses arose that promised to sell directly to theconsumer, thus cutting out the middle person\u2014the retailer\u2014and lowering prices. During the bust of the dotcom boom in the 1990s, businesses fought to secure a web presence. Many retailers were forced to shut their doors and went out of business.\n\nDecades after the dotcom revolution, B2C companies with a web presence continue to dominate over their traditional brick-and-mortar competitors. Companies such as Amazon, Priceline, and eBay are survivors of the early dotcom boom. They have gone on to expand upon their early success to become industry disruptors.\n\nOnline B2C can be broken down into five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community-based, and fee-based.\n\nThere are typically five types of online B2C business models that most companies use online to target consumers.\n\n1. Direct sellers.This is the most common model in which people buy goods from online retailers. These may includemanufacturersor small businesses or simply online versions of department stores that sell products from different manufacturers.\n\n2. Online intermediaries.These are liaisons or go-betweens who don't actually own products or services that put buyers and sellers together. Sites like Expedia, trivago, and Etsy fall into this category.\n\n3. Advertising-based B2C.This model uses free content to get visitors to a website. Those visitors, in turn, come across digital or online ads. Large volumes of web traffic are used to sell advertising, which sells goods and services. One example is media sites like HuffPost, a high-traffic site that mixes advertising with its native content.\n\n4. Community-based.Sites like Meta (formerly Facebook), which build online communities based on shared interests, help marketers and advertisers promote their products directly to consumers. Websites typically target ads based on users' demographics and geographical location.\n\n5. Fee-based.Direct-to-consumer sites like Netflix charge a fee so consumers can access their content. The site may also offer free but limited content while charging for most of it. TheNew York Timesand other large newspapers often use a fee-based B2C business model.\n\nDecades after the e-commerce boom, B2C companies are continuing to eye a growing market: mobile purchasing. Withsmartphoneapps and traffic growing year-over-year, B2C companies have shifted attention to mobile users and capitalized on this popular technology.\n\nThroughout the early 2010s, B2C companies were rushing to develop mobile apps, just as they were with websites decades earlier. In short, success in a B2C model is predicated on continuously evolving with consumers' appetites, opinions, trends, and desires.\n\nBecause of the nature of the purchases and relationships between businesses, sales in the B2B model may take longer than those in the B2C model.\n\nAs mentioned above, the business-to-consumer model differs from the business-to-business (B2B) model. While consumers buy products for their personal use, businesses buy products to use for their companies. Large purchases, such ascapital equipment, generally require approval from those who head up a company. This makes a business' purchasing power more complex than that of the average consumer.\n\nUnlike the B2C business model, pricing structures tend to be different in the B2B model. With B2C, consumers often pay the same price for the same products. However, prices are not necessarily the same. Businesses tend to negotiate prices and payment terms.\n\nAfter surging in popularity in the 1990s, business-to-consumer (B2C) increasingly became a term that referred to companies with consumers as their end-users. This stands in contrast to business-to-business (B2B), or companies whose primary clients are other businesses. B2C companies operate on the internet and sell products to customers online. Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook), and Walmart are some examples of B2C companies.\n\nOne example of a major B2C company today is Shopify, which has developed a platform for small retailers to sell their products and reach a broader audience online.\u00a0Before the advent of the internet, however, business-to-consumer was a term that was used to describe take-out restaurants, or companies in a mall, for instance. In 1979, Michael Aldrich further utilized this term to attract consumers through television.\n\nTypically, B2C models fall into the following five categories: direct sellers, online intermediaries, advertising-based B2C, community-based, and fee-based. The most frequently occurring is the direct seller model, where goods are purchased directly from online retailers. By contrast, an online intermediary model would include companies like Expedia, which connect buyers and sellers. Meanwhile, a fee-based model includes services such as Disney+, which charges a subscription to stream their video-on-demand content.\n\nB2C, or the business-to-consumer model, refers to companies that sell directly to their consumers, without going through retailers or other intermediaries. B2C sales originally relied on television advertisements to reach consumers, and gained greater prominence when the internet became widespread. B2C sales are contrasted with B2B models, in which companies direct their sales at other businesses.\n\nMichael Aldrich Archive. \"Inventor's Story.\"\n\nSensor Tower. \"Mobile App Market Outlook 2022.\" Pages 5, 10.",
