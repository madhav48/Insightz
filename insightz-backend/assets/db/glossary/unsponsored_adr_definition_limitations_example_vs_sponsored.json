  "definition": "PhotoAlto Eric Audras / Getty Images\n\nAn unsponsored ADR is anAmerican depositary receipt(ADR) issued by a depositary bank without the involvement, participation, or consent of the foreign company it represents ownership in.\n\nADRs are negotiable certificates that represent a certain number ofsharesin a foreign company. ADRs are issued by banks outside the U.S. and trade just like shares on Americanstock exchangesin U.S. dollars. These securities allow foreign corporations to enter the American financial markets and attract American capital. They also give American investors a way to invest in foreign companies they may otherwise not be able to access.\n\nADRs can besponsoredor unsponsored. A sponsored one is issued in collaboration with the foreign company, while an unsponsored ADR is established without the company's cooperation.\n\nHow does an ADR get established in the U.S. without a company's consent? The answer is simple\u2014demand. Adepositoryentity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad. The issuing entity is normally abroker-dealerthat owns common stock in the company.\n\nUnsponsored ADRs are normally issued by broker-dealers that own common stock in a foreign company.\n\nBecause they're issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally tradeover-the-counter(OTC)\u2014rather than on a stock exchange. And there's another catch. Shareholder benefits andvoting rightsmay not be extended to the holders of these particular securities.\n\nSince depository banks were not required to notify the underlying issuers or obtain permission before registering unsponsored ADRs with theSecurities and Exchange Commission(SEC), there was a rush to bring them tomarket, resulting in multiple unsponsored ADRs sometimes being created for the same issuer.\n\nThe number of unsponsored ADR issues surged after Oct. 10, 2008, when the SEC amended an exemption applicable to foreign issuers. This exemption allowed them to have their securities traded through the U.S. OTC market without the registration required under Section 12(g) of theSEC Act of 1934(SEA).\n\nThis amendment eliminated the written application and paper submission requirements by providing an automatic exemption from Section 12(g) to foreign issuers that met certain conditions. These conditions required the issuer to maintain a listing of its shares in itsprimary marketoutside the U.S. and publish electronically specified non-U.S.disclosuredocuments in English.\n\nAs mentioned above, sponsored ADRs have the full cooperation of the foreign company, enabling them to tap into internationalcapital marketsdirectly. Although a sponsored ADR would be listed in the United States, the issuing company still has itsrevenueand profit denominated in its home currency.\n\nThere are three levels of sponsored ADRs:\n\nMore than 2,000 ADRs\u2014both sponsored and unsponsored\u2014traded in the United States in 2012,according to the SEC.\n\nMany large globalcorporationsuse unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company's unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.",
