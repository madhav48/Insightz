  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nProbate court is a segment of the judicial system that oversees the execution of wills as well as the handling of estates,conservatorships, and guardianships. Probate court also handles the commitment of a person with psychiatric disabilities to institutions designed to help them.\n\nProbate court ensures that a will is executed according to the wishes of the individual who has passed away. It makes sure that all debts owed are paid and that assets are distributed properly. The court oversees and usually must approve the activities of the executor appointed to handle these matters.\n\nIn addition, when a will is contested, the probate court is responsible for ruling on the authenticity of the document and the cognitive stability of the person who signed it. If no will exists, the court also decides who receives thedecedent'sassets, based on the laws of the jurisdiction in place.\n\nThe term \"probate\" is used to describe the legal process that involves the handling of the estate of a recently deceased person. Broadly, the role of the court is to make sure that their debts are paid and their assets are distributed to the correctbeneficiaries, according to the decedent's wishes as detailed in a will.\n\nProbate is multifaceted in that it refers to the overall legal process of dealing with a deceased person's assets and debt, the court that manages the process, and the actual distribution of assets.\n\nIndividual states have rules concerning probate and probate courts. Some states do not use the term \"probate\" but instead refer to a surrogate\u2019s court, orphan\u2019s court, or chancery court. It's important to review the laws regarding probate in the state in which a will is to be probated before death (if you're creating a will) and after death (if you are a beneficiary or executor).\n\nMany local courts offer complete instructions concerning probate. For example, the New York State Unified Court System allows individuals to search by their county and type of court to begin the probate process.\n\nProbate is usually necessary for property that is titled only in the name of the person who passes away. For example, that might include a car or real estate. It's also usually necessary for an interest in any property that is owned astenants in common.\n\nHere are some of the assets that don't need to be probated, according to legal information expert, AllLaw.\n\nA formal probate process involves specific, usually straightforward steps. Issues that may arise during the process can lengthen the time it lasts until it is closed by the court.\n\nAn informal probate process, also called summary probate, that requires less court oversight can be used if the estate is small, the will is simple, all parties are in agreement with it, and no objections are raised. The will and death certificate still must be filed in this instance.\n\nWhen a person dies with no will, the probate court distributes that person's assets to theirnext of kin, according to the relevant state's probate laws. This is known as the law ofintestatesuccession. It outlines the distribution of assets among surviving spouses, children, grandchildren, siblings, parents, aunts, uncles, and other relatives.\n\nWith or without a will, going to probate court is likely required to settle a decedent's affairs. However, there are ways to simplify the probate process prior to death, including creating a living trust, naming beneficiaries clearly on all investment, bank, and retirement accounts, and establishing joint ownership for certain assets.\n\nA probate lawyer is often hired to help deal with the intricacies of probate. Other costs of probate can include court filing fees, costs for publishing a death notice, and an executor's fees.\n\nIf the estate is large and complicated, the assistance of an accountant may be needed. The deceased's estate lawyer may also need to be involved.\n\nCosts will mount the longer the probate process takes to complete. In general, the process can take six months to a couple of years.\n\nUnderstandably, people want to avoid orshorten the probate process, if possible. This can be done by setting up aliving trust, assigning your assets to it, and designating beneficiaries for those assets. A living trust is an estate planning tool that can help you avoid the usually lengthy, sometimes costly, and always public nature of probate.\n\nYou can keep financial assets out of probate court by designating beneficiaries for them in the account paperwork held by, for example, your life insurance company, retirement plan, brokerage, and bank. This way, funds will flow directly to the beneficiaries upon your death.\n\nIn addition, to avoid probate of money you'd like to leave to beneficiaries, consider gifts during your lifetime. People can give individuals tax-free money in the form of gifts, as defined by theInternal Revenue Service (IRS). In 2024, the maximum allowable amount is $18,000 ($17,000 in 2023) per person before a gift tax return must be filed.\n\nAt a probate court hearing, the judge will list the responsibilities of the executor of the will, including contacting any beneficiaries and creditors, appraising the deceased's assets, and paying any outstanding creditors and taxes. Usually, at the second court hearing, the judge will ensure all these items have been done and close out the estate so that the transfers of money and other assets in the estate may begin.\n\nEach state has specific probate laws to determine what's required. Unless someone has no assets or descendants when they die, probate is usually still required in order to settle the deceased's remaining affairs, including debts, assets, and paying their final bills and taxes.\n\nWhile it can be tricky to avoid probate court completely, some ways to avoid probate include creating a living trust, naming beneficiaries clearly on all investment, bank, and retirement accounts, and establishing joint ownership for certain assets.\n\nThe length of time varies depending on the deceased person's assets, the complexity of their will, and other factors. For example, the executor may have to liquidate assets to pay creditors. Selling a home or other property for this purpose can take time. Generally speaking, probate can go from a few weeks to a few years.\n\nThe probate court website usually has forms available to file an objection, whether it's an objection to tampering with the will, forgery, or something else. These forms must be submitted at the beginning of the process.\n\nAfter someone passes away, the grief over their loss can be all-consuming for the remaining family and friends. Unfortunately, the probate process can add an additional burden, one that's financial and administrative. With or without a will, the probate process is essential to understand to ensure that all of one's affairs are in order prior to death.\n\nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. \"When a Loved One Dies and Debt Collectors Come Calling.\"\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"The Probate Process.\"\n\nNew York State Unified Court System. \"Probate - When a Person Dies with a Will.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Program Operations Manual System (POMS): SI 01110.510 Sole vs. Shared Ownership.\"\n\nAllLaw. \"What Assets Must Go Through Probate?\"\n\nCornell Law School, Legal Information Institute. \"Intestate Succession.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Frequently Asked Questions on Gift Taxes,\" Select \"How many annual exclusions are available?\"",
