  "term": "Harmless Warrant",
  "definition": "The term harmless warrant refers to a provision that requires bondholders to surrender an existing bond if they want to purchase the same type ofbondfrom the issuer. Put simply, bond issuers put harmlesswarrantson their bonds, requiring investors to swap their existing bond if they want to purchase another one with similar features from the same issuer. Harmless warrants are a safety net for bond issuers as they help keep theirdebtlevels in check.\n\nWarrants are derivative securities that allow the holder the right\u2014not the obligation\u2014to purchase or sell a specific security at a specific price before theexpiration date. They come in several different forms, including harmless warrants.\n\nA harmless warrant is attached to bonds and offered by bondholders. An investor who buys a bond with a harmless warrant cannot purchase another bond from the same issuer with the same terms until the investor surrenders the first bond they purchased. This includes any bonds that have the samematuritydate,yield, and principal amount. As such, Mr. Investor can't purchase a $1,000 10-year bond from Company A without surrendering the first one they own with the same terms.\n\nBonds are a form of debt for the issuer. The investor lends the entity a specific sum of money for a period of time in exchange for theprincipalbalance plus interest at maturity. As such, these instruments add to the issuer's total amount of debt. Issuing bonds with harmless warrants allows these entities to control their debt levels. In this way, an investor can't get too muchleverageon the issuer while preventing the issuer from getting into a dangerous situation in which an investor\u00a0calls multiple bonds that the issuer can't cover.\n\nOne important point to note is that not all issuing entities attach harmless warrants on their bond offerings.\n\nHarmless warrants are also called wedding warrants.\n\nIf harmless warrants prevent investors from purchasing multiplebondswith similar terms from the same issuer, what happens if someone wants to buy different bonds from the issuer?\n\nThese warrants don't prevent bondholders from purchasing bonds with different terms from the same issuer. This means they may purchase other bonds with different maturity terms, yield rates, and principal amounts.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that most investors generally want to repeat certain investments because of the favorable terms they carry, so a harmless warrant forces an investor to decide which of the terms are the most crucial. That is unless they are willing to surrender the original bond to purchase a new one with the same terms.\n\nHarmless warrants are not detachable, which means they can't be separated from the underlying security. As such, you can't sell the bond or warrant separately on the secondary market.\n\nRemember that a harmless warrant gives the holder the right to purchase anotherbondat the same terms as the bond to which the harmless warrant applies. However, the harmless warrant does not give the holder the right to own two bonds with the same terms at the same time. Instead, it requires the holder to surrender the first bond to be allowed to buy the second bond with the same terms.\n\nA warrant, on the other hand, is a type ofderivativesecurity because it gives the holder the right to act in some way with another security. A warrant gives the holder the right to buy or sell anothersecurityat a specific time, although the warrant holder does not have the obligation to exercise this warrant. The holder of the original security purchases the warrant to have the right to do whatever the warrant delineates.\n\nBonds and warrants are not the same thing. Bonds are fixed-income investments that guarantee investors the return of their principal along with a set interest rate by a certain period of time. Warrants, on the other hand, are derivatives that give the holder the right but not the obligation to purchase or sell the underlying security at a certain price by the expiration date. Warrants can be attached to bonds. Bond-linked warrants give perks to both investors and bond issuers.\n\nDetachable warrants are derivatives that are attached to certain securities. They allow the holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a certain price within a certain period of time. As their name implies, these warrants can be detached or removed from the associated asset and sold or traded separately on the secondary market. As such, the holder can sell either the investment or the detachable warrant and keep the other.\n\nA penny warrant is a warrant that comes with an exercise price (the agreed-upon price for the underlying asset) of one cent or another nominal amount.\n\nYou can sell a warrant as long as it's detachable. Detachable warrants are those that can be removed from the underlying asset, such as a stock. Once detached, they can be traded on their own. If you do this, it means that you claim the asset itself but sell (or trade) the warrant itself on the secondary market\u2014usually over-the-counter or through a broker.",
