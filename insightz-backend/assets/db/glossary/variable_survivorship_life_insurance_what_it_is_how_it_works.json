  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nVariable survivorship life insurance is a type ofvariable life insurancepolicy that covers two individuals and pays a death benefit to a beneficiary only after both people have died. It may pay out a benefit prior to the first policyholder's death if the policy has a living benefit rider. The living benefit rider is often automatically included in life insurance policies at no cost. This rider allows access to a certain amount of policy death benefit in the case of terminal illness as defined in the policy.\n\nVariable survivorship life insurance is also called \"survivorship variable life insurance\" or \"last-survivor life insurance.\"\n\nLike any variable life policy, variable survivorship life insurance has a cash value component in which a portion of each premium payment is set aside to be invested by the policyholder, who bears all investment risk. The insurer selects several dozen investment options from which the policyholder may choose.\n\nThe other portion of the premium goes toward administrative expenses and the policy's death benefit (also called face value). This type of policy is legally considered a security because of its investment component and is subject to regulation by theSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n\nA more flexible version of variable survivorship life insurance called \"variable universal survivorship life insurance\" allows the policyholder to adjust the policy's premiums and death benefit during the policy's life.\n\nVariable survivorship\u00a0life insurance policies\u00a0let\u00a0policyholders\u00a0invest premiums in a separate account whose value will fluctuate based on the performance of the market.\n\nVariable survivorship\u00a0life insurance is typically thousands of dollars cheaper than regular single-insured life insurance because the premiums associated with survivorship\u00a0policies are determined by the joint life expectancy of the insured parties. As such, premiums are cheaper than purchasing individual policies for both individuals because the insurance company is not obligated to pay benefits until the deaths of both policyholders occur.\n\nIt is significantly easier to qualify for a survivorship life\u00a0policy than is it to qualify for single-insured life insurance. This is mainly due to the fact that variable survivorship life insurance companies are less worried about the health statuses of the individual policyholders, who must both die before the benefit is paid. Consequently, underwriting is less stringent and acceptance is more likely.\n\nSurvivorship life insurance is sometimes touted as a means to grow anestateand not just shield the estate from tax liabilities. The death benefit of a survivorship life policy is similar to traditional life insurance in that it can ensure beneficiaries receive at least a moderate payout, even if a policyholder\u00a0burns through his entire estate during the beneficiary\u2019s lifetime.\n\nIndividuals interested in bequeathing their assets to their loved ones tend to favor survivorship life insurance\u00a0policies because they provide liquidity for an estate to cover various taxes.\n\nFinancial Industry Regulatory Authority. \u201cInsurance.\u201d",
