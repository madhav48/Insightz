  "definition": "Paige McLaughlin / Investopedia\n\nChi-square is a statistical measurement that shows how well a model fits the observed data.\n\nA chi-square (\u03c72)statistic is a test that compares observed data to the model and measures its fit. The data used in calculating a chi-square statistic must be random, raw, mutually exclusive, drawn from independent variables, and derived from a sufficiently large sample. For example, the results of tossing a fair coin meet these criteria.\n\nChi-square tests are often used to test hypotheses. The chi-square statistic compares the size of any discrepancies between the expected results and the actual results, given the size of the sample and the number of variables in the relationship.\n\nFor these tests,degrees of freedomare used to determine if a certainnull hypothesiscan be rejected based on the total number of variables and samples within the experiment. As with any statistic, the larger the sample size, the more reliable the results.\n\n\ufeff\u03c7c2=\u2211(Oi\u2212Ei)2Eiwhere:c=Degrees\u00a0of\u00a0freedomO=Observed\u00a0value(s)\\begin{aligned}&\\chi^2_c = \\sum \\frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \\\\&\\textbf{where:}\\\\&c=\\text{Degrees of freedom}\\\\&O=\\text{Observed value(s)}\\\\&E=\\text{Expected value(s)}\\end{aligned}\u200b\u03c7c2\u200b=\u2211Ei\u200b(Oi\u200b\u2212Ei\u200b)2\u200bwhere:c=Degrees\u00a0of\u00a0freedomO=Observed\u00a0value(s)\u200b\ufeff\n\nThere are two main kinds of\u00a0chi-square tests that will provide different information:\n\nChi-square analysis is applied to categorical variables and is especially useful when those variables are nominal (where order doesn\u2019t matter, like marital status or gender).\n\nWhen considering student gender and course choice, a\u03c72test for independence could be used. To do this test, the researcher would collect data on the two chosen variables (gender and courses picked) and then compare the frequencies at which male and female students select among the offered classes using the formula given above and a\u03c72statistical table.\n\nIf there is no relationship between gender and course selection (that is if they are independent), then the actual frequencies at which male and female students select each offered course should be expected to be approximately equal, or conversely, the proportion of male and female students in any selected course should be approximately equal to the proportion of male and female students in thesample.\n\nA\u03c72test for independence can tell us how likely it is that random chance can explain any observed difference between the actual frequencies in the data and these theoretical expectations.\n\nIn a test of independence, a company may want to evaluate whether its new product, an herbal supplement that promises to give people an energy boost, is reaching the people who are most likely to be interested.\n\nIt is beingadvertisedon websites related to sports and fitness, on the assumption that active and health-conscious people are most likely to buy it. It does an extensive poll that is intended to evaluate interest in the product by demographic group. The poll suggests no correlation between interest in this product and the most health-conscious people.\n\n\u03c72provides a way to test how well a sample of data matches the (known or assumed) characteristics of the larger population that the sample is intended to represent. This is known as goodness of fit.\n\nIf the sample data does not fit the expected properties of the population in which one is interested, then one would not want to use this sample to draw conclusions about the larger population.\n\nAs an example of a test ofgoodness of fit, a marketing professional is considering launching a new product that the company believes will be irresistible to women over age 45. The company has conducted product testing panels of 500 potential product buyers.\n\nThe marketing professional has information about the age and gender of the test panels. This allows the construction of a chi-square test showing thedistributionby age and gender of the people who said they would buy the product.\n\nThe result will show whether or not the likeliest buyer is a woman over 45. If the test shows that men over age 45 or women ages 18 to 44 are just as likely to buy the product, then the marketing professional will revise the advertising, promotion, and placement of the product to appeal to this wider group of customers.\n\nFor example, consider an imaginary coin with exactly a 50/50 chance oflanding heads or tailsand a real coin that you toss 100 times. If this coin is fair, then it will also have an equal probability of landing on either side, and the expected result of tossing the coin 100 times is that heads will come up 50 times and tails will come up 50 times.\n\nIn this case,\u03c72can tell us how well the actual results of 100 coin flips compare to the theoretical model that a fair coin will give 50/50 results. The actual toss could come up 50/50, or 60/40, or even 90/10.\n\nThe farther away the actual results of the 100 tosses are from 50/50, the less good the fit of this set of tosses is to the theoretical expectation of 50/50, and the more likely one might conclude that this coin is not actually a fair coin.\n\nA chi-square test is used to help determine if observed results are in line with expected results and to rule out that observations are due to chance.\n\nA chi-square test is appropriate for this when the data being analyzed is from arandom sample, and when the variable in question is a categorical variable. A categorical variable consists of selections such as type of car, race, educational attainment, male or female, or how much somebody likes a political candidate (from very much to very little).\n\nThese types of data are often collected via survey responses or questionnaires. Therefore, chi-square analysis is often most useful in analyzing this type of data.\n\nThese are the basic steps whether you are performing a goodness-of-fit test or a test of independence:\n\nThe chi-square test is sensitive to sample size. Relationships may appear to be significant when they aren\u2019t, simply because a very large sample is used.\n\nIn addition, the chi-square test cannot establish whether one variable has a causal relationship with another. It can only establish whether two variables are related.\n\nChi-square is a statistical test used to examine the differences between categorical variables from a random sample in order to judge the goodness of fit between expected and observed results.\n\nSince chi-square applies to categorical variables, it is most used by researchers who are studying survey response data. This type of research can range from demography to consumer and marketing research to political science and economics.\n\nA nominal variable is a categorical variable that differs by quality, but whose numerical order could be irrelevant. For instance, asking somebody their favorite color would produce a nominal variable. Asking somebody\u2019s age, on the other hand, would produce an ordinal set of data. Chi-square can be best applied to nominal data.\n\nA chi-square statistic is used to measure the difference between the observed and expected frequencies of the outcomes of a set of variables. It can be helpful for analyzing differences in categorical variables, especially those nominal in nature. The two different types of chi-square tests\u2014test of independence and test of goodness of fit\u2014will answer different relational questions.",
