  "term": "Financial Performance: Definition, How It Works, and Example",
  "definition": "A company\u2019s financial performance shows how well it generates revenue and how it manages its liabilities and assets.\n\nAnalysts and investors use financial performance to compare similar firms across the same industry or to compare industries or sectors in aggregate. The term is also used as a general measure of a firm's overall financial health over a given period.\n\nInvestopedia / Madelyn Goodnight\n\nThere are many stakeholders in a company, including trade creditors, bondholders, investors, employees, and management.\n\nEach group has an interest in tracking the financial performance of a company. The financial performance identifies how well a company generates revenues and manages its assets, liabilities, and the financial interests of its stakeholders and stockholders.\n\nThere are many ways to measure financial performance, but all measures should be taken in aggregate. Line items, such as revenue from operations,operating income, or cash flow from operations, can be used, as well as total unit sales.\n\nFurthermore, the analyst or investor may wish to look deeper into financial statements and seek out margin growth rates or any declining debt.Six Sigmamethods focus on this aspect.\n\nA key document in reporting corporate financial performance, one heavily relied on by research analysts, isForm 10-K. The Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0(SEC) requires all public companies to file and publish this annual document. Its purpose is to provide stakeholders with accurate and reliable data and information that provides an overview of the company's financial health.\n\nIndependent accountants audit the information in a 10-K, and company management signs it and other disclosure documents. As a result, the 10-K represents the most comprehensive source of information on financial performance made available to investors annually.\n\nA company's Form 10-K has to be accessible to the public. Anyone who wishes to examine one can go to the SEC'sElectronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval(EDGAR) database. You can search by company name, ticker symbol, or SEC Central Index Key (CIK). Many companies also post their 10-Ks on their websites, in an \"Investor Relations\" section.\n\nAlthough the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, a company's Form 10-K is not the same as its annual report. Both include information about the company and its financial performance over the last year. But the annual report is more of a polished publication, lavishly illustrated and describing various projects and initiatives the company undertakes. The 10-K lacks such photos and graphics but generally goes into more financial details and calculations.\n\nIncluded in the 10-K are three financial statements: the balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement.\n\nThebalance sheetis a snapshot of the finances of an organization as of a particular date. It provides an overview of how well the company manages its assets and liabilities.\n\nAnalysts can find information about long-term versus short-term debt on the balance sheet. They can also find information about what kind of assets the company owns and what percentage of assets are financed with liabilities versus stockholders' equity.\n\nTheincome statementprovides a summary of operations for the entire year. The income statement starts with sales or revenues and ends with net income.\n\nAlso referred to as the profit and loss statement, the income statement provides the gross profit margin, the cost of goods sold, the operating profit margin, and the net profit margin. It also provides an overview of the number of shares outstanding, as well as a comparison against the performance of the prior year.\n\nThecash flow statementis a combination of both the income statement and the balance sheet. For some analysts, the cash flow statement is the most important financial statement because it provides a reconciliation between net income and cash flow.\n\nThis is where analysts see how much the company spent on stock repurchases, dividends, and capital expenditures. It also provides the sources and uses of cash flow from operations, investing, and financing.\n\nOther specialized financial performance indicators are more specific to certain industries. For example, companies whose sales of goods and services vary depending on the time of the year might use seasonality as a metric, measuring how a certain period or season affects the figures and outcomes.\n\nAs an example of financial performance analysis, let's look at the Coca-Cola Company's year-over-year performance in 2024 versus 2023, as noted in its income statement below from its 2024 year-end financial statements.\n\nCoca-Cola had good revenue growth in 2024, but unfortunately, its net income for the year decreased. The company saw a 2.86% increase in revenue with a 0.77% decrease in net income. The decrease in income primarily comes from an increase in \"other operating charges,\" which grew by 113.4%, significantly reducing operating income.\n\nThis doesn't necessarily spell trouble for Coca-Cola, as it's a small decrease, the company is large, has a strong market share, and the increase in other operating charges could be due to a temporary business decision. This is why it's important to evaluate multiple metrics when evaluating a company's financial performance.\n\nBecause financial performance provides insight into how a company is doing with its money, such as how much it makes from selling its products and services, and how it handles its finances, such as debt, it allows you to see if the company is doing well, growing, or having difficulties. This allows you to be a better investor.\n\nIf you want to invest in companies by buying stock or bonds, understanding financial performance will help you choose companies that are stable and likely to grow, growing your investment, as opposed to companies that may do poorly, resulting in financial loss for you.\n\nUnderstanding financial performance also goes further than being useful for an investor; it's particularly important if you have your own business. Tracking your financial health can assist with managing finances and making the right business decisions, such as those on spending, borrowing, marketing, and expanding.\n\nA company's financial performance tells investors about its general well-being. It's a snapshot of its economic health and the job its management is doing\u2014providing insight into the future: whether its operations and profits are on track to grow or if the stock is expected to appreciate.\n\nFinancial performance indicators, also known askey performance indicators(KPIs), are quantifiable measurements used to determine, track, and project the economic well-being of a business. They act as tools for both corporate insiders (like management and board members) and outsiders (like research analysts and investors) to analyze how well the company is doing, especially regarding competitors, and identify where strengths and weaknesses lie.\n\nThe most widely used financial performance indicators include:\n\nFinancial analysis\u00a0refers to the process of studying and assessing a company\u2019s financial statements\u2014a collection of data and figures organized according to recognized accounting principles. The aim is to understand the company's business model, the profitability (or loss) of its operations, and how it's spending, investing, and generally using its money\u2014summarizing the company by the numbers, so to speak.\n\nA financial performance analysis examines the company at a specific period in time, usually, the most recent fiscal quarter or year. The balance sheet, the income statement, and the cash flow statement are three of the most significant financial statements used in performance analysis.\n\nFinancial performance analysis can focus on different areas. Types of analysis can include a specific examination of a firm:\n\nA company's financial performance can be improved in several ways. Of course, trying to identify any roadblocks or friction points\u2014and the source of these problems\u2014is the first step. Other strategies include:\n\nWhile there are many types of financial statements, the big three are:\n\nThe financial performance of a company is based on numbers. But in the end, it imparts an impression about the company and its soundness. A financial analysis of a company's financial statements, summarized in annual reports and Form 10-Ks, is essential for any serious investor seeking to understand and value a company properly.\n\nHowever, it's also important to realize that financial performance reflects the past and is never an exact indicator of the future. Nor does it exist in a vacuum. Those evaluating a company's financial performance should always consider it in light of other, comparable businesses; the overall industry; and the company's history.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Exchange Act Reporting and Registration.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"EDGAR - Search and Access.\"\n\nHarvard Business School Online. \"13 Financial Performance Measures Managers Should Monitor.\"\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company. \"Coca-Cola Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2024 Results,\" Page 11.",
