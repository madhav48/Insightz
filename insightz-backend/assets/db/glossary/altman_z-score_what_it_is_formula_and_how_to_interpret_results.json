  "definition": "The Altman Z-score is a financial metric used to evaluate the likelihood that a publicly traded company may face bankruptcy, serving as an indicator of its overall credit health.\n\nThe Altman Z-score is a financial tool designed to assess the risk of bankruptcy in publicly traded companies. By analyzing key financial ratios related to profitability, leverage, liquidity, and activity, the score provides insight into a company's financial stability and its chances of defaulting on obligations.\n\nThe Altman Z-score, a variation of the traditionalZ-scorein statistics, is based on five financial ratios that can be calculated from data found on a company's annual 10-K report. It uses profitability, leverage, liquidity, solvency, and activity to predict whether a company has a high probability of becominginsolvent.\n\nNYU Stern Finance Professor Edward Altman developed the Altman Z-score formula in 1967, and it was published in 1968. Over the years, Altman has continued to reevaluate his Z-score. From 1969 until 1975, Altman looked at 86 companies in distress, then 110 from 1976 to 1995, and finally 120 from 1996 to 1999, finding that the Z-score had an accuracy of between 82% and 94%.\n\nIn 2012, he released an updated version called the Altman Z-score Plus that one can use to evaluate public and private companies, manufacturing and non-manufacturing companies, and U.S. and non-U.S. companies. One can use Altman Z-score Plus to evaluate corporate credit risk. The Altman Z-score has become a reliable measure of calculating credit risk.\n\nOne can calculate the Altman Z-score as follows:\n\nAltman Z-Score = 1.2A + 1.4B + 3.3C + 0.6D + 1.0E\n\nA score below 1.8 means it's likely the company is headed for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go bankrupt. Investors can use Altman Z-scores to determine whether they should buy or sell a stock if they're concerned about the company's underlying financial strength. Investors may consider purchasing a stock if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3, and selling orshortinga stock if the value is closer to 1.8.\n\nIn more recent years, however, a Z-score closer to 0 indicates a company may be in financial trouble. In a lecture given in 2019 titled \"50 Years of the Altman Score,\" Professor Altman himself noted that recent data has shown that 0\u2014not 1.8\u2014is the figure at which investors should worry about a company's financial strength.Thetwo-hour lectureis available to view for free on YouTube.\n\nIn 2007, the credit ratings of specific asset-related securities were rated higher than they should have been. The Altman Z-score indicated that the companies' risks were increasing significantly and may have been heading for bankruptcy.\n\nAltman calculated that the median Altman Z-score of companies in 2007 was 1.81. These companies' credit ratings were equivalent to a B. This indicated that 50% of the firms should have had lower ratings, were highly distressed, and had a high probability of becoming bankrupt.\n\nAltman's calculations led him to believe a crisis would occur and that there would be a meltdown in the credit market. He believed the crisis would stem from corporate defaults, but the meltdown, which brought about the2008 financial crisis, began withmortgage-backed securities(MBS).However, corporations soon defaulted in 2009 at the second-highest rate in history.\n\nThe Altman Z-score, a variation of the traditional Z-score in statistics, is based on five financial ratios that can be calculated from data found on a company's annual 10-K report. The formula for Altman Z-Score is 1.2*(working capital / total assets) + 1.4*(retained earnings / total assets) + 3.3*(earnings before interest and tax / total assets) + 0.6*(market value of equity / total liabilities) + 1.0*(sales / total assets).\n\nInvestors can use Altman Z-score Plus to evaluate corporate credit risk.\u00a0A score below 1.8 signals the company is likely headed for bankruptcy, while companies with scores above 3 are not likely to go bankrupt. Investors may consider purchasing a stock if its Altman Z-Score value is closer to 3 and selling, or shorting, a stock if the value is closer to 1.8. In more recent years, Altman has stated that a score closer to 0 rather than 1.8 indicates a company is closer to bankruptcy.\n\nIn 2007, Altman's Z-score indicated that the companies' risks were increasing significantly. The median Altman Z-score of companies in 2007 was 1.81, which is very close to the threshold that would indicate a high probability of bankruptcy. Altman's calculations led him to believe a crisis would occur that would stem from corporate defaults, but the meltdown, which brought about the 2008 financial crisis, began with mortgage-backed securities (MBS); however, corporations soon defaulted in 2009 at the second-highest rate in history.\n\nNYU Stern. \"Predicting Financial Distress of Companies: Revisiting the Z-Score and Zeta Models,\" Page 18.\n\nNYU Stern. \"Professor Edward Altman Launches Digital App for Renowned Z-Score, \"Altman Z-Score Plus.\"\n\nNYU Stern. \"Predicting Financial Distress of Companies: Revisiting the Z-Score and Zeta Models,\" Page 26.\n\nNYU Stern. \"A 50-Year Retrospective on Credit Risk Models, the Altman Z-Score Family of Models and Their Applications to Financial Markets and Managerial Strategies,\" Page 20.\n\nNYU Stern. \"Special Report on Defaults and Returns in the High-Yield Bond Market: The Year 2007 in Review and Outlook,\" Pages 9-13 and 27.\n\nNYU Stern. \"Special Report on Defaults and Returns in the High-Yield Bond Market: The Year 2007 in Review and Outlook,\" Pages 9-13 and 26.\n\nNYU Stern. \"Special Report On Defaults and Returns in the High-Yield Bond and Distressed Debt Market: The Year 2009 in Review and Outlook,\" Page 3.",
