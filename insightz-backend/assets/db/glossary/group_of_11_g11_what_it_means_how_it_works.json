  "term": "Group of 11 (G11): What it Means, How it Works",
  "definition": "The Group of 11 (G-11) is a group of developing countries created to ease members' debt burdens to direct their resources to economic development. The G-11 came into existence on Sept. 20, 2006, and was initially conceived by King Abdullah of Jordan. The group is mainly made up of lower-middle-income countries.\n\nThe G11 member countries are Croatia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, Honduras, Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, and Sri Lanka. Originally, Tunisia was part of the original 11 but was replaced by El Salvador by 2007.\n\nThe Group of 11 (G-11) member countries believe that their debt hinders their development in that it consumes much of theirexportearnings and fiscal revenues. They believe it is in the interest of more developed countries that their debt is written off and/or converted into assistance for economic development projects.\n\nIn addition, tariffs imposed by the G-7 and other developed countries also hamper the growth of national income and the improvement of living standards, which often pursue development via export-led growth. The group, therefore, also seeks to work with member countries of theGroup of Seven (G-7)for increased market access, lower tariffs, and investment. G-11 members believe that the international donor community can help accelerate global peace and security by helping those countries achieve sustained economic growth.\n\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan. \"His Majesty King Abdullah II Opens the Group of 11/Lower-Middle Income Countries Summit.\" Accessed Aug. 30, 2021.\n\nKing Abdullah II of Jordan. \"King Urges New Development Partnership.\" Accessed Aug. 30, 2021.\n\nKing Abdullah of Jordan II. \"King Urges Developed Countries to Support Development.\" Accessed Aug. 30, 2021.",
