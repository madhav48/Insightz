  "term": "Business Exit Strategy: Definition, Examples, Best Types",
  "definition": "A business exit strategy is an entrepreneur's strategic plan to sell his or her\u00a0ownership in a company toinvestorsor another company. An exit strategy gives a business owner a way to reduce or liquidate his\u00a0stake in a business and, if the business is successful, make a substantial profit. If the business is not successful, an exit strategy (or \"exit plan\") enables theentrepreneurto limit losses. An exit strategy may also be used by an investor such as aventure capitalistin order to plan for a cash-out of an investment.\n\nBusiness exit strategies should not be confused withtrading exit strategiesused in securities markets.\n\nIdeally, an entrepreneur will develop an exit strategy in their\u00a0initial business plan before actually going into business. Thechoice of exit plancan influence business development decisions. Common types of exit strategies includeinitial public offerings (IPO), strategicacquisitions, andmanagement buyouts (MBO). Which exit strategy an entrepreneur chooses depends on many factors, such as how much control or involvement (if any) they\u00a0want to retain in the business, whether they\u00a0want the company to be run in the same way after their departure, or whether they're willing to see it shift, provided they are paid well to sign off.\n\nA strategic acquisition, for example, will relieve the founder of his or her ownership responsibilities, but will also mean the founder is giving up control. IPOs are often seen as the holy grail of exit strategies since they often bring along the greatest prestige and highest payoff. On the other hand, bankruptcy is seen as the least desirable way to exit a business.\n\nA key aspect of an exit strategy isbusiness valuation, and there arespecialiststhat can help business owners (and buyers) examine a company's financials to determine a fair value. There are also transition managers whose role is to assist sellers with their business exit strategies.\n\nDifferent business exit strategies also offer business owners different levels ofliquidity. Selling ownership through a strategic acquisition, for example, can offer the greatest amount of liquidity in the shortest time frame, depending on how the acquisition is structured. The appeal of a given exit strategy will depend on market conditions, as well; for example, an IPO may not be the best exit strategy during a recession, and a management buyout may not be attractive to a buyer when interest rates are high.\n\nWhile an IPO will almost always be a lucrative prospect for company founders and seed investors, these shares can be extremely volatile and risky for ordinary investors who will be buying their shares from the early investors.\n\nThe best type of exit strategy also depends on business type and size. A partner in a medical office\u00a0might benefit by\u00a0selling to one of the other existing partners, while a sole proprietor\u2019s ideal exit strategy might simply be to make as much money as possible, then close down the business. If the company has multiple founders, or if there are substantial shareholders in addition to the founders, these other parties\u2019 interests must be factored into the choice of an exit strategy as well.",
