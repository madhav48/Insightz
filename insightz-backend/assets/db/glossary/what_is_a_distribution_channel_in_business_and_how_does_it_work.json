  "term": "What Is a Distribution Channel in Business and How Does It Work?",
  "definition": "A distribution channel is the network of businesses or intermediaries through which a good or service passes until it reaches the final buyer (the end consumer). Distribution channels can includewholesalers,retailers, distributors, and the Internet.\n\nDistribution channels are part of the downstream process, which addresses the business question \"How do we get our product to the consumer?\" The downstream process is in contrast to the upstream process\u2014also known as the supply chain\u2014which addresses the business question \"Who are our suppliers?\"\n\nA distribution channel is a chain of businesses or intermediaries through which a good or service passes until it reaches the intended consumer. Distribution channels can be short or long, depending on the number of intermediaries required to deliver a product or service.\n\nIncreasing the number of ways a consumer can find a good can increase sales, but it can also create a complex system that sometimes makesdistribution managementmore difficult. Longer distribution channels can also mean less profit for each intermediary along the way.\n\nProducer: Producers combine labor and capital to create goods and services for consumers.\n\nAgent: Agents commonly act on behalf of the producer to accept payments and transfer the title of the goods and services as they move through distribution.\n\nWholesaler: A person or company that sells large quantities of goods, often at low prices, to retailers.\n\nRetailer: A person or business that sells goods to the public in small quantities for immediate use or consumption.\n\nEnd Consumer: A person who buys a product or service.\n\nA\u00a0direct\u00a0channel allows the consumer to make purchases from the manufacturer. This direct (and short) channel may mean lower costs for consumers because they are buying directly from the manufacturer.\n\nAn indirect channel allows the consumer to buy the goods from a wholesaler or retailer. Indirect channels are typical for goods that are sold in traditional brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nHybrid distribution channels\u00a0use both direct channels and indirect channels. A product or service manufacturer may use a retailer to distribute a product or service, in addition to also making sales directly with the consumer.\n\nThis is adirect-to-consumermodel, where the producer sells its product directly to the end consumer. Amazon, which\u00a0uses its sales platform to sell its Kindle product to customers, is an example of a Level 0 (direct) model. This\u00a0is the shortest distribution channel possible, cutting out both the wholesaler and the retailer.\n\nA producer sells directly to a retailer, who then\u00a0sells the product to the end consumer. This level includes only one intermediary. For example, Hewlett-Packard and Dell are large enough to sell their computer products directly to retailers, including Best Buy.\n\nIncluding two intermediaries, this level includes the producer, wholesaler, retailer, and consumer.\n\nIn the wine and adult beverage industry, a winery cannot sell directly to a retailer.A winery must utilize a multi-tiered system, like a Level 2 system; the law requires the winery to first sell its product to awholesaler, who then sells to a retailer. The retailer then sells the product to the end consumer.\n\nThis level may add the role of the individual, sometimes referred to as a \"jobber.\" A jobber is a small-scale wholesaler or middleman in the retail goods trade. This role may involve assembling products from a variety of producers, storing them, selling them to retailers, and acting as a middle-man for wholesalers and retailers.\n\nA distribution channel can be part of a company's marketing strategy, which also includes the product, promotion, and price.\n\nDigital technology has transformed the way businesses, especially small businesses, use direct channels of distribution. With increasing consumer demand for online shopping and easy-to-use e-commerce tools, direct selling usually equals more success for businesses.\n\nRather than having to rely on relationships with retailers to sell their products, software and artificial intelligence (AI) sales technology allows companies to manage sales and automatically achieve highcustomer relationship management (CRM).\n\nOnline advertising, through social networks and search engines, targets specific areas or demographics; social media networks are increasingly considered the industry standard and are changing traditional marketing strategies.\n\nIf a company continues to use indirect channels of distribution, digital technology also allows it to manage relationships with wholesale and retail partners more efficiently.\n\nNot alldistribution channelswork for all products, so companies need to choose the right one. The channel should align with the firm's overall mission and strategic vision\u2014including its sales goals.\n\nThe method of distribution should add value to the consumer. Do consumers want to speak to a salesperson? Will they want to handle the product before they make a purchase? Or do they want to purchase it online with no hassles? Answering these questions can help companies determine which channel to choose.\n\nSecondly, the company should consider how quickly it wants its product(s) to reach the buyer. Certain products are best served by a direct distribution channel, such as meat or produce, while others may benefit from an indirect channel.\n\nIf a company chooses multiple distribution channels, such as selling products online and through a retailer, the channels should not conflict with one another. Companies should strategize so one channel doesn't overpower the other.\n\nThe term \u201cdistribution channel\u201d refers to the methods used by a company to deliver its products or services to the end consumer. It often involves a network of intermediary businesses, including manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. Selecting and monitoring distribution channels is a key component ofmanaging supply chains.\n\nDirect distribution channels are those that allow the manufacturer or service provider to deal directly with its end customer. For example, a company that manufactures clothes and sells them directly to its customers using an e-commerce platform is utilizing a direct distribution channel. By contrast, if that same company relied on a network of wholesalers and retailers to sell its products, then it would be using an indirect distribution channel.\n\nPlacement is\u00a0the way a company ensures its target market has access to its products or services in the location where they are most likely to look for that product or service. An effective distribution system ensures that products are placed in the right location as needed.\n\nA distribution channel is the network of businesses or intermediaries through which a good or service passes until it reaches the end consumer.\n\nDistribution channels can contain many levels or intermediaries, such as wholesalers or retailers, as products move from manufacturer to consumer. The introduction of e-commerce platforms has streamlined the distribution process, enabling producers to sell directly to consumers.\n\nAlcohol and Tobacco Tax Trade Bureau. \"Liquor Laws and Regulations for Retail Dealers.\"",
