  "term": "What Is the Volume Price Trend (VPT) Trading Indicator?",
  "definition": "The volume price trend (VPT) indicator helps determine a security\u2019s price direction and strength of price change.\u00a0The indicator consists of a\u00a0cumulative volume line that adds or subtracts a multiple of thepercentage changein a share price\u2019s trend and current volume, depending upon the security\u2019s upward or downward movements.\n\nThe volume price trend indicator is used to determine thebalance between a security\u2019s demand and supply. The percentage change in the share pricetrendshows the relative supply or demand of a particular security, whilevolume indicates the force behind the trend. The VPT indicator is similar to theon-balance volume (OBV) indicatorin that it measures cumulative volume and provides traders with information about a security\u2019s money flow.Most charting software packages have the VPT indicator included.\n\nAs a technical momentum indicator, VPT allows traders and analysts to identify the supply and demand parity of a stock. The following are some of the trading signals they look for.\n\nAsignal line, which is just a moving average of the indicator, can be applied and used to generate trading signals. For example, a trader may buy a stock when the VPT line crosses above its signal line and sell when the VPT line passes below its signal line.\n\nThe VPT indicator can be used in conjunction with moving averages and theaverage directional index (ADX)to confirm trending markets. For instance,\u00a0a trader\u00a0could buy a stock if the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average and accompanied by rising VPT indicator values. Conversely, the trader may decide to sell if the 20-day moving average is below the 50-daymoving averageand the indicator\u2019s values are falling.\n\nThe ADX also measures trends andmomentumand can be used with the VPT indicator to confirm that a market is trending. ADX readings above 25 indicate that a security is trending, while readings below 25 indicate sideways price action. Therefore, atradercould buy when the ADX is above 25, and the VPT line is above its signal line. They could sell when the ADX has a value below 25, and the VPT line is below its signal line.\n\nTraders can use the VPT indicator to spot technical divergence.Divergenceoccurs when the indicator makes a higher high or a lower low, but the security\u2019s price makes a lower high or a higher low. Traders should place astop-loss orderabove the most recent swing high or below the most recent swing low to minimize risk.\n\nTrading View. \"Volume Price Trend with Divergence and Pivot Points.\"\n\nIFC Markets. \"Average Directional Index - ADX Indicator.\"",
