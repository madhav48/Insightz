  "definition": "The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) is a labor law requiring employers of a certain size to provide employees with unpaid time off for serious family health issues or situations. Qualified reasons may include adoption, pregnancy, foster care placement, family or personal illness, or military leave. It also provides for the continuation ofinsurancecoverage and job protection while the employee is on leave. The FMLA is intended to provide families with the time and resources to deal with family emergencies, while also guiding employers.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division (DOL-WHD) is in charge of the FMLA program.\n\nThe FMLA was signed into law on Feb. 5, 1993, by President Bill Clinton.Its passage was an acknowledgment by the federal government of changes in U.S. families, the workplace, and thelabor force\u2014for example, the proliferation of single-parent households or households in which both parents work\u2014and the expectations of both employees and employers.\n\nThe law guarantees that a qualified employee may take up to 12 weeks off for reasons such as pregnancy/childbirth,\u00a0adoption, personal illness, or the illness of a family member. The types of\u00a0qualified medical and family situations\u00a0also include foster care or military leave\u2014for instance, if the eligible employee is a service member\u2019s spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave), they are entitled to 26 weeks of leave.\n\nThe FMLA-mandated time off is an unpaid leave.\n\nFurthermore, an employee who takes unpaid leave that falls under the FMLA is job-protected; that is, the employee can return to the same position held before the leave began. If the same position is unavailable, the employer must provide a position that is substantially equal in pay, benefits, and responsibility.\n\nThe FMLA seeks to remove the need for workers to choose between their jobs and their families, enabling them to balance employment security and caring for their children, parents, or other members of their extended family.\n\nIt impacts women in particular by recognizing the outsized roles they play in caregiving, and the fact that their familial role as default caregiver has a significant effect on their working lives and careers. For instance, it allows them to take a leave to care for a newborn or an adopted child, with the assurance that they can return to their job afterward.\n\nBut it also acknowledges the importance of men in serving a role in their families beyond that of the breadwinner.\n\nThe FMLA's intentions are indicated in the stated intentions of the bill itself:\n\nIn 2020, theFamilies First Coronavirus Response Act(FFCRA) expanded the FMLA's provisions to include leaves for COVID-19 related purposes. The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) expanded that program and extended it to Sept. 30, 2021.\n\nNot every employee is covered by the Family and Medical Leave Act. Companies have to be of a certain size, and the worker has to have met certain conditions.\n\nSpecifically, to qualify for time off under theFMLA, a worker:\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.\" Accessed Mar. 22, 2021.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"News Release: Family and Medical Leave Act Benefits Workers and Their Families, Employers.\" Accessed Mar. 22, 2021.\n\nDept. of Labor. \"Family and Medical Care Act.\" Accessed Mar. 22, 2021.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Sec. 104.\" Accessed Mar. 22, 2021.\n\nU.S. Department of Labor. \"The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, Sec. 2.\" Accessed Mar. 22, 2021.\n\nJD Supra.\u201cAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021: Employment Update.\u201dAccessed Mar. 22, 2021.",
