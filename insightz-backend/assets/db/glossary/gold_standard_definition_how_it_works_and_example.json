  "term": "Gold Standard: Definition, How It Works, and Example",
  "definition": "The gold standard is a fixed monetary regime under which the government's currency is fixed and may be freely converted into gold. It can also refer to a freely competitive monetary system in which gold or bank receipts for gold act as the principal medium of exchange; or to a standard of international trade, wherein some or all countries fix theirexchange ratebased on the relative gold parity values between individualcurrencies.\n\nThe gold standard is a monetary system where a country's currency or paper money has a value directly linked to gold. With the\u00a0gold standard, countries agreed to convert paper money into a fixed amount of gold.\n\nA country that uses the gold standard sets a fixed price for gold and buys and sells gold at that price. That fixed price is used to determine the value of the currency. For example, if the U.S. sets theprice of goldat $500 an ounce, the value of the dollar would be 1/500th of an ounce of gold.\n\nThe gold standard developed a nebulous definition over time but is generally used to describe any commodity-based monetary regime that does not rely on un-backed fiat money, or money that is only valuable because the government forces people to use it. Beyond that, however, there are major differences.\n\nSome gold standards only rely on the actual circulation of physical gold coins and bars, orbullion, but others allow other commodities or paper currencies. Recent historical systems only granted the ability to convert the national currency into gold, thereby limiting the inflationary and deflationary ability of banks or governments.\n\nMostcommodity-money advocates choose gold as amedium of exchangebecause of its intrinsic properties. Gold has non-monetary uses, especially in jewelry, electronics, and dentistry, so it should always retain a minimum level of real demand.\n\nIt is perfectly and evenly divisible without losing value, unlike diamonds, and does not spoil over time. It is impossible to counterfeit perfectly and has a fixed stock\u2014there is only so much gold on Earth, and inflation is limited to the speed of mining.\n\nThere are many advantages to using the gold standard, including price stability.\u00a0This is a long-term advantage that makes it harder for governments to inflate prices by expanding themoney supply.\n\nInflation is rare and hyperinflation doesn't happen because the money supply can only grow if the supply of gold reserves increases. Similarly, the gold standard can provide\u00a0fixed international rates between countries that participate and can also reduce the uncertainty in international trade.\n\nBut it may cause an imbalance between countries that participate in the gold standard. Gold-producing nations may be at an advantage over those that don't produce the precious metal, thereby increasing their reserves.\n\nThe gold standard may also, according to some economists, prevent the mitigation of economicrecessionsbecause it hinders the ability of a government to increase its money supply\u2014a tool manycentral bankshave to help boost economic growth.\n\nAround 650 B.C., gold was made into coins for the first time, enhancing its usability as a monetary unit. Before this, gold had to be weighed and checked for purity when settling trades.\n\nGold coins were not a perfect solution, since a common practice for centuries to come was to clip these slightly irregular coins to accumulate enough gold that could be melted down into\u00a0bullion. In 1696, the Great Recoinage in England introduced a technology that automated the production of coins and put an end to clipping.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution in 1789 gave Congress the sole right to coin money and the power to regulate its value. Creating a united national currency enabled the standardization of a monetary system that had up until then\u00a0consisted of circulating foreign coins, mostly silver.\n\nWith silver in greater abundance relative to gold, abimetallic standardwas adopted in 1792. While the officially adopted silver-to-gold parity ratio of 15:1 accurately reflected the market ratio at the time, after 1793 the value of silver steadily declined, pushing gold out of circulation, according toGresham's law.\n\nThe gold standard is not currently used by any government. Britain stopped using the gold standard in 1931 and the U.S. followed suit in 1933 and abandoned the remnants of the system in 1973.\n\nThe so-called \"classical gold standard era\" began in England in 1819 and spread to France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the United States. Each government pegged its national currency to a fixed weight in gold. For example, by 1834, U.S. dollars were convertible to gold at a rate of $20.67 per ounce. These parity rates were used to price international transactions. Other countries later joined to gain access to Western trade markets.\n\nThere were many interruptions in the gold standard, especially during wartime, and many countries experimented with bimetallic (gold and silver) standards. Governments frequently spent more than their gold reserves could back, and suspensions of national gold standards were extremely common. Moreover, governments struggled to correctly peg the relationship between their national currencies and gold without creating distortions.\n\nAs long as governments or central banks retained monopoly privileges over the supply of national currencies, the gold standard proved an ineffective or inconsistent restraint on fiscal policy. The gold standard slowly eroded during the 20th century. This began in the United States in 1933, when Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed an executive order criminalizing the private possession of monetary gold.\n\nAfter WWII, theBretton Woods agreementforced Allied countries to accept the U.S. dollar as a reserve rather than gold, and the U.S. government pledged to keep enough gold to back its dollars. In 1971, the Nixon administration terminated the convertibility of U.S. dollars to gold, creating a fiat currency regime.\n\nAs its name suggests, the term gold standard refers to a monetary system in which the value of a\u00a0currency\u00a0is based on gold. Afiatsystem, by contrast, is a monetary system in which the value of a currency is not based on any physical\u00a0commodity\u00a0but is instead allowed to fluctuate dynamically against other currencies on the\u00a0foreign-exchange markets.\n\nThe term \"fiat\" is derived from the Latinfieri, meaning an arbitrary act or decree. In keeping with this etymology, the value of fiat currencies is ultimately based on the fact that they are defined as\u00a0legal tender\u00a0by government decree.\n\nIn the decades prior to the First World War,\u00a0international trade\u00a0was conducted on the basis of what has come to be known as the classical gold standard. In this system, trade between nations was settled using physical gold. Nations with\u00a0trade surpluses\u00a0accumulated gold as payment for their\u00a0exports. Conversely, nations with\u00a0trade deficits\u00a0saw their\u00a0gold reserves\u00a0decline, as gold flowed out of those nations as payment for their\u00a0imports.\n\nThe U.S. officially stopped using the gold standard in 1971 under President Nixon. At the time, inflation was growing and there was a gold run on the horizon. Nixon's administration ended the dollar convertibility to gold, which ended the Bretton Woods System.\n\nThe gold standard in the U.S. and many other nations was replaced by fiat money. Fiat money is the currency of a government, which is not backed by a commodity but has value because the government has determined that it does and that it must be accepted as a form of payment. Fiat money includes paper bills and metal coins.\n\nCurrently, no country uses the gold standard. Countries have abandoned the gold standard for fiat money. Countries, however, do still maintain gold reserves.\n\nThe gold standard is a fixed currency system in which a government's currency is fixed to the value of gold. This stands in contrast to currency systems that use fiat money; money issued by a government that is not tied to a commodity.\n\nThe gold standard was used much throughout history, in ancient civilizations as well as in modern nations. The United States used the gold standard but eventually stopped in the 1970s and is now a fiat-money-based monetary system.\n\nBBC: A History of the World. \"Gold Coin of Croesus.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of New York: Liberty Street Economics. \"Crisis Chronicles: The \u201cNot So Great\u201d Re-Coinage of 1696.\"\n\nU.S. Senate. \"Constitution of the United States.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Brief History of the Gold Standard in the United States,\" Page 17.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \"Brief History of the Gold Standard in the United States,\" Page 9 and 11\n\nThe National Archives. \"Going off Gold.\"\n\nEconomic History Association. \"Gold Standard.\"\n\nNational Mining Association. \"Historic Gold Prices.\n\nThe American Presidency Project. \"Executive Order 6102\u2014Requiring Gold Coin, Gold Bullion and Gold Certificates to Be Delivered to the Government.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Launch of the Bretton Woods System.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Nixon Ends Convertibility of US Dollars to Gold and Announces Wage/Price Controls.\"",
