  "term": "Gross Value Added (GVA): Definition, Formula, and Example",
  "definition": "Grass value added is a metric that measures the economic contributions of producers, industries, sectors, and regions to economies.\n\nGross value added (GVA) is an economic productivity metric that measures the contribution of a producer, industry, sector,\u00a0or region to an economy.\n\nGVA provides a dollar value for the amount of goods and services that have been produced in a country, minus the cost of all inputs, raw materials, and intermediate consumption that are directly attributable to that production. GVA thus adjusts gross domestic product (GDP) by the impact of subsidies and taxes (tariffs) on products.\n\nGVA is the country's output minus its intermediate consumption (the spending required to produce goods and services), which is the difference between gross output and net output. GVA is important because it is used when calculating gross domestic product (GDP), a key indicator of the state of a nation's total economy. It can also be used to see how much value is added (or lost) from a particular industry, region, state,\u00a0or province for policy-making purposes.\n\nAt the national level, GVA is sometimes favored as a measure of total economic output and growth over GDP orgross national product(GNP). GVA is related to GDP through taxes and subsidies on products. It adds back subsidies that governments grant to certain sectors of the economy and subtracts taxes imposed on others.\n\nAt the company level, this metric is often used to represent the GVA by a particular product, service, or corporate unit that the company currently produces or provides. Once the consumption offixed capitaland the effects ofdepreciationare subtracted, the company knows how much net value a particular operation adds to its bottom line. In other words, the GVA number reveals the contribution made by that particular product to the company's profit.\n\n\ufeffGVA=GDP+SP\u2212TPwhere:SP=Subsidies\u00a0on\u00a0productsTP=Taxes\u00a0on\u00a0products\\begin{aligned} &\\text{GVA}=\\text{GDP} + \\text{SP}-\\text{TP}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ &\\text{SP}=\\text{ Subsidies on products}\\\\ &\\text{TP}=\\text{ Taxes on products} \\end{aligned}\u200bGVA=GDP+SP\u2212TPwhere:SP=Subsidies\u00a0on\u00a0productsTP=Taxes\u00a0on\u00a0products\u200b\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nLet's consider a hypothetical example for the fictitious country,Investopedialand. As a very simplified example of calculating GVA, consider the following data for our fictitious country:\n\nUsing this data, the GVA can be calculated. The first step is to calculate the GDP. Recall that GDP is computed as private consumption + gross investment + government investment + government spending + (exports- imports):\n\nNext, we calculate the subsidies and taxes on products. For simplicity's sake, assume that all private consumption is consumption of products. In that case, subsidies and taxes are as follows:\n\nWith this, the GVA can be calculated as follows:\n\nGross domestic product (GDP) measures the value of all the goods and services produced in a country. Gross value added (GVA) is the value added to other (purchased) goods and services, which are used to produce within an economy. GVA takes the GDP and adds the value of subsidies paid on those products, subtracting taxes paid on them.\n\nNet value added is obtained by subtracting the consumption of fixed capital (the decline in value of fixed assets from aging, wear and tear, obsolescence, and other factors) from GVA.\n\nGross value added is important because it allows lawmakers to allocate resources and create economic policies that might boost the output of producers, sectors, regions, or industries.\n\nGross value added is the amount of capital (value) added to an economy by sectors, regions, producers, or industries. It is calculated by subtracting the cost of all inputs, raw materials, and taxes from all sectors and industries from gross national product and adding subsidies.\n\nEurostat. \"Glossary: Gross Value Added.\"",
