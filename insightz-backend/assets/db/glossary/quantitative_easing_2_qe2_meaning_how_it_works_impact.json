  "term": "Quantitative Easing 2 (QE2): Meaning, How it Works, Impact",
  "definition": "QE2\u00a0refers to the second round of the Federal Reserve'squantitative easingprogram that sought\u00a0to stimulate the U.S. economy following the 2008 financial crisis and Great\u00a0Recession. Announced in November 2010, QE2 consisted of an additional $600 billion in purchases of U.S. Treasuries and the reinvestment of proceeds from priormortgage-backed securitypurchases.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nQuantitative easing stimulates an economy through a central bank's purchase ofgovernment bondsor otherfinancial assets. Often,central banksuse quantitative easing when interest rates are already zero or at near 0% levels. This type of monetary policy increases themoney supplyand typically raises the risk of inflation. Quantitative easing is not specific to the U.S. and is used in a variety of forms by central banks around the world.\n\nQE2 came at a time when the U.S. recovery remained patchy. While equity markets had recovered from 2008 lows, unemployment remained high at 9.8%\u2014two percentage points aboveGreat Recessionlevels.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff The fundamental reason behind QE2 was to shore up bank liquidity and lift inflation. At the time of the announcement, U.S. consumer prices had remained stubbornly low.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nInterest rates initially rose after the announcement, with the 10-year yield trading above 3.5%. However, from February 2011, three months after the announcement, the 10-year yield began a two-year year decline, falling 200 basis points to trade under 1.5%.\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff\n\nQE2 was relatively well received, with most economists noting that while asset prices were propped up, the health of the banking sector was still a relative unknown. It was less than two years since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, and with confidence still low, it was prudent to promote investment through cheaper money.\u00a0The policy was not without its critics. Some economists noted that previous easing measures had lowered rates but did relatively little to increase lending. With the Fed buying securities with money that it had essentially created out of thin air, many also believed it would leave the economy vulnerable to out-of-control inflation once the economy fully recovered.\n\nTwo years later, the Federal Reserve embarked on its third round of quantitative easing (QE3),\ufeff\ufeff\ufeff something that was not as well received with many saying the Fed balance sheet had expanded to an already lofty level and it was time to seek alternative strategies.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"FOMC statement - November 03, 2010.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2021.\n\nBoard of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \"Federal Reserve issues FOMC statement - September 12, 2012.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2021.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Databases, Tables & Calculators by Subject.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2021.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \"Consumer Price Index Historical Tables for U.S. City Average.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2021.\n\nMacrotrends. \"10 Year Treasury Rate - 54 Year Historical Chart.\" Accessed Feb. 6, 2021.",
