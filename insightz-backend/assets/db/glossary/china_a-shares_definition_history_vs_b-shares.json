  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nChina A-shares\u00a0are the stock shares of mainlandChina-based companiesthat trade on the two Chinese stock exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). Historically, China A-shares were only available for purchase by mainland citizens due to China's restrictions on\u00a0foreign investment.\n\nHowever, since 2003, select foreign institutions have been able to purchase these shares through\u00a0theQualified Foreign Institutional Investor(QFII) system. Established in 2002, the QFII program allows specified licensed international investors to buy and sell on mainland China's stock exchanges.\n\nA-shares are also known as domestic shares because they use the Chinese renminbi (RMB) for valuation.\n\nChina A-shares are different from B-shares. A-shares are only quoted in RMB, while B-shares are quoted in foreign currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, and are more widely available to foreign investors. Foreign investors may have difficulty accessing A-shares because of Chinese government regulations, and Chinese investors may have difficulty accessing B shares most notably for currency-exchange reasons. Some companies opt to have their stock listed on both the A-shares and B-shares market.\n\nDue to the limited access of Chinese investors to B-shares, the stock of the same company often trades at much higher valuations on the A-shares market than on the B-shares market. Although foreign investors may now invest in A-shares, there is a monthly 20%\u00a0limit on repatriation of funds to foreign countries.\n\nThe Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) publishes the key performance index for A-shares, known as\u00a0theSSE 180 Index. In composing the index, the exchange selects 180 stocks listed on the SSE. The selection is diversified between sector, size, and liquidity to ensure adequate representation. Thus, the index's performance benchmark reflects the overall situation and operation of the Shanghai securities market.\n\nSince its inception in 1990, including a major reform in 2002, the index has seen great fluctuations. However, it\u00a0has grown along with the Chinese economy. The years 2015 to 2016 were\u00a0a particularly\u00a0difficult period, with a 52-week performance of -21.55%\u00a0as of July 20, 2016.\n\nAs China grows from an emerging\u00a0market to anadvanced economy, there is substantial demand for Chineseequity. Stock exchange regulators continue efforts to make A-shares more broadly available to foreign investors\u00a0and have them recognized by the global investing community.\n\nIn June 2017, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index announced a two-phase plan in which it would gradually add222 China A large-cap stocks. In May 2018, the index began topartially include China's large-cap A shares, which make up 5% of the index. Full inclusion would make up 40% of the index.\n\nIt is important for countries such as China to open their markets to global investors to stay competitive and thrive economically. China A-shares provide an alternative investment for those interested intrading in Chinese securities.",
