  "definition": "In law, a deposition is an integral part of the discovery process. It is testimony made under oath and taken down in writing by an authorized officer of the court, typically in an out-of-court setting and before trial.\n\nThe discovery process enables both sides involved in a legal case to unearth all the pertinent facts and learn about the other side\u2019s view of the case in order to map out an effective legal strategy.\n\nDepositions are usually taken from key witnesses, but can also involve theplaintiffor defendant, and often take place in an attorney's office rather than the courtroom. The individual making the deposition is known as the deponent. Since the deponent is under oath, false statements can carry civil and criminal penalties.\n\nAs with any discovery proceeding, the primary objective of a deposition is to give all parties involved in the litigation a fair preview of the evidence and level the field as far as information is concerned, so that there are no unwelcome surprises at trial.\n\nA deposition also preserves the testimony of the witness if it is taken in a relatively short time period after the occurrence of the crime or accident since a trial may be months away and the witness\u2019s recollection of the event may get blurred with the passage of time.\n\nA deposition would be required, for instance, if one were to witness an accident that resulted in a liability lawsuit. All parties involved in the case are permitted to attend the deposition.\n\nThe deponent will be asked a number of questions related to thelawsuitby the attorneys on both sides. A court reporter who is present accurately records every question and answer in the deposition, and produces a transcript that can later be used at trial.\n\nDue to the exhaustive questioning that is characteristic of depositions, they may last several hours. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and its state equivalents, a deposition must take a maximum of seven hours per day for each deponent.\n\nIn Canada, the deposition process is called \u201cexamination for discovery,\" and examinations for discovery are limited to seven hours per party conducting the examination.\n\nQuestions asked at a deposition can be more wide-ranging than those that may be allowed in courtroom proceedings. For example, a witness to anautomobile accidentmay be asked a series of questions such as:\n\nAs depositions are a critical part of thelitigationprocess, and can significantly affect the outcome of a trial, legal professionals strive to adequately prepare their clients for depositions. While deponents are required to be scrupulously honest in their answers to questions, the objective is to avoid common mistakes made by deponents.\n\nThese mistakes may include saying too much, thereby providing information that can be used to the advantage of the opposing side. Another common mistake is making guesses or assumptions, since deponents are required to stick to the facts and not speculate or theorize.\n\nThe length of a deposition will depend on the scope of the questions, the details needed, and the willingness to participate by the person being deposed. In general, a deposition can last as little as 30 minutes to no more than seven hours per day, but there can be multiple sessions.\n\nAfter a deposition has been finished, transcriptions and/or video recordings of the testimony are sent to both sides' lawyers for review and analysis. The depositions, along with other evidence collected during the discovery period, will either lead to a settlement out of court or a trial.\n\nIf you aresubpoenaedto sit for a deposition, you must show up by law and answer the questions honestly and to the best of your knowledge. Failure to show up could result in imprisonment forcontempt of courtand forced into a deposition there. Lying under oath can result in the crime of perjury.\n\nA deposition is a crucial part of the legal discovery process where a witness or party gives sworn testimony outside of the court. It helps both sides understand the evidence and avoid surprises at the trial. Depositions often take a long time, occur in an attorney's office, and allow for all parties to ask questions.\n\nThe testimony is then used to formulate a strategy by both sides and can decide whether the case gets settled or goes to trial.\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \"Perjury During Depositions and Its Consequences.\"\n\nThe Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives. \"Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Page 50.\n\nCanadian Legal Information Institute. \"Rules of Civil Procedure Chapters, Discovery, Rule 31 - Examination for Discovery, 1st ed, 2021\u00a0CanLIIDocs\u00a02023: Time Limits.\"\n\nThe Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives. \"Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\" Pages 61-63.",
