  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA homeowners association (HOA) fee is a monthly charge paid by some residential property owners, either monthly or yearly, to theirhomeowners associations (HOAs). These fees help fund the maintenance, repair, and improvement of shared areas within a community.\n\nHOA fees are commonly associated withcondominiumowners, but they may also apply in some single-family home neighborhoods. HOA fees are sometimes referred to as \u201ccommon charges\u201d or \u201cmaintenance charges.\u201d\n\nA homeowners association is an organization that creates and enforces rules for properties within a community. HOAs are often formed in planned communities, subdivisions, or condominium buildings. Property owners within these communities are automaticallymembers of the HOAand are required to pay monthly HOAfees.\n\nHOA fees paid by condo owners usually cover the costs of maintaining the building\u2019s common areas, such as:\n\nFees may cover some common utilities, such as water/sewer fees and garbage disposal. The association may alsolevyspecial assessments from time to time if its reserve funds (funds set aside for major and/or emergency repairs) are not sufficient to cover a major repair, such as a new elevator or roof.\n\nThese fees can also apply to single-family houses\u2014especially town houses\u2014in certain neighborhoods, particularly if there are commonamenitieslike tennis courts, a community clubhouse, or neighborhood parks to maintain.\n\nHOA fees tend to vary drastically, depending on the property or community. The fees range anywhere from $100 to $1,000 per month. The average, though, tends to be from $200 to $300 per month. The general rule that applies is the more services and amenities, the higher the fees.\n\nSome HOA rules can be restrictive, especially regarding property modifications. These rules are outlined in the homeowner\u2019s agreement.\n\nIf a member fails to remit payment to the HOA, it affects the other members of the community. Common areas may suffer due to lack of funds, or other members may be assessed special fees to covermaintenance costsor other expenses.\n\nThe HOA has the authority to take action againstdelinquenthomeowners. The actions depend on the contract between the HOA and the homeowner. Some contracts dictate that the HOA can charge late fees to the homeowner, while others allow the HOA to initiate a lawsuit, place alienon the property, orforecloseon the owner\u2019s property to collect the delinquent payments.\n\nSome associations may assess both condo fees and HOA fees, so it\u2019s a good idea to find out how much you\u2019ll be responsible to pay before you purchase a property.\n\nThe main problem that people have with HOA fees is the cost. These fees can range from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars each month, based on the type of property and the amenities involved. Paying monthly fees on top ofmortgage paymentsand other costs, such as utilities, can put financial pressure on property owners.\n\nOwners may even face higher fees if thereserve fundisn\u2019t properly managed. Remember, these are funds that are set aside for unexpected and/or major repairs to the property. And the HOA\u2019s board and/or management have afiduciary dutyto make sure that their reserve funds are maintained and managed properly.\n\nHOAs also establish rules related to parking or the use of common areas. In neighborhoods with single-family homes, the HOA may create rules on how often members can paint their houses, which types of fences they may have, how they must maintain their landscaping, and any other related issues. This can often ruffle feathers and create legal hurdles for both the associations and homeowners.\n\nHOA fees generally cover the maintenance of common areas, such as lobbies, patios, landscaping, swimming pools, tennis courts, and community clubhouses. In many cases, the fees also cover utilities like water, sewer services, and garbage disposal.Special assessmentsmay also apply for large repairs when reserve funds are insufficient.\n\nHOA fees vary greatly, with some estimates placing them between $100 and $1,000 per month. On average, the fees range from $200 to $300 per month. The more amenities and services provided, the higher the fees are likely to be. In some cases, poorly managed reserve funds can also lead to increased fees.\n\nIf a homeowner fails to pay their HOA fees or special assessments, the HOA can take action. Depending on the contract, this may include charging late fees, initiating a lawsuit, placing a lien on the property, or even foreclosure to recover unpaid amounts.\n\nSince HOA fees pay for the amenities and maintenance in a community, those prices will vary from place to place. In high-cost-of-livingcities like New York, even basic maintenance will be more expensive than in low-cost-of-living cities because of higher minimum wages, power costs, and/or taxes. HOA fees may also be higher in condominiums than they are in single-family houses since the fees will pay for electricity, heating, cooling, etc. in common areas. In a recent survey, New York was listed as the highest mean HOA cost amongst metro areas, at $653. On the other end of the spectrum was Dallas with a mean of $98.\n\nHOA fees are common in many condominiums, co-ops, and planned communities. These fees help cover the maintenance of shared areas, such as hallways, elevators, and parking lots. They may also pay for services like snowplowing and landscaping. Homeowners should factor in HOA fees when calculating their monthly expenses, especially if they are considering purchasing property in a community governed by an HOA.\n\nRuby Home Real Estate. \"HOA Stats: Average HOA Fees & Number of HOAs by State.\"",
