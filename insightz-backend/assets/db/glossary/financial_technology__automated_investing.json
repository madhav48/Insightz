  "definition": "From online brokerages increasing the ease of trading to mobile banking lowering the barriers for consumers to have access to the banking system, fintech has brought many advantages for consumers.\n\nFintech is a portmanteau of the words \u201cfinancial\u201d and \u201ctechnology,\u201d and refers to technologies used in the financial sector of the economy. This includes things such as online banking apps, online stock brokerages, and mobile payment apps.\n\nMoore\u2019s law is a name given to a prediction by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the number of transistors that could be put on a computer chip would roughly double every 2 years. This trend held true for several decades after it was made in the 1960\u2019s, and the exponential increase in transistor density has continued, albeit, not at the same rate.\n\nQuantum computing is a field of computing that uses the principles of quantum mechanics to change the way computers store and process information. Specifically, instead of data being stored as bits, which are individual units of binary code, they would be stored as Qubits (a portmanteau of \u201cquantum\u201d and \u201cbits\u201d). Qubits would be able to be in a quantum superposition of being both 0 or 1, which would allow significantly great processing capability.\n\nOpen banking, is a practice that involves the sharing of financial data between financial service providers through the use ofapplication programming interfaces (APIs). This practice could potentially open up new options to consumers and/or significantly compromise individuals' data security and privacy.\n\nCost per click (CPC) is a model that some websites use to bill advertisers who advertise on their sites. It charges advertisers a certain amount, the aforementioned CPC, per time a visitor to the website clicks on the ad displayed there. Some sites use a different model which charges advertisers per certain number of people, usually 1000, who see an ad. That model is called \u201ccost per mile.\u201d\n\nMobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, is the use of smartphones, cell phones, and similar mobile devices to make commercial transactions. This can include purchasing items or paying bills.\n\nInsurtech is a portmanteau of \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201ctechnology,\u201d and refers to the technology used by the insurance industry. Examples include mobile apps through which people can purchase insurance.\n\nA quick response (QR) code is a kind of barcode that can be read easily by a computer. It stores information in a square-shaped grid, rather than a series of lines like a conventional barcode.\n\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP) is an inventory management system that uses software to keep track of and manage a business\u2019s inventory and supply chain. It requires significant initial costs and high-quality data, but can increase supply chain efficiency if those requirements are met.\n\nMobile banking is when banking services are used via mobile devices such as smartphones.\n\nGPUs are a particular type of computer chip that is specialized at creating computer graphics. They were traditionally used to allow computers to play games and do 3D art and design. However, the kind of mathematics involved in computer graphics is of a similar type to the kind used to mind Bitcoin and train AIs, so the demand for GPUs has risen substantially in recent years as new uses have emerged.",
