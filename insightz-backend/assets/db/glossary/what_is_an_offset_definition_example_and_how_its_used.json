  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nAn offset is a financial market strategy that requires a trader to take an opening position and then take a directly opposite position. For example, if you are long 100 shares of XYZ, selling 100 shares of XYZ would be the offsetting position.\n\nAn offsetting position can also be generated throughhedginginstruments such as futures oroptions. In thederivativesmarkets, to offset afuturesposition a trader enters an equivalent but opposite transaction that eliminates thedeliveryobligation of the physical product that it represents.\n\nThe goal of offsetting is to reduce an investor's net position in an investment to zero so that no further gains or losses are experienced from that position.\n\nIn business, an offset refers to the generation of gains in one business unit that makes up for losses in another unit.\n\nOffsetting is used in several types of businesses. Its effect is to remove or limit liabilities.\n\nBusinesses may offset losses in one business division by reallocating gains from another. This allows the profitability of one activity to support the other activity.\n\nFor example, a business that is successful in the smartphone market may decide to produce a tablet as a new product line. The profits from smartphone sales can help offset the early losses associated with expanding into a new arena.\n\nSimilarly, companies with global sales may offset losses in one currency with gains in another. One unit may have risk exposure to a decline in the Swiss franc compared to the euro, while another may benefit from a declining franc.\n\nInvestors offset futures contracts and other investment positions to remove themselves from any associatedliabilities. Almost all futures positions are offset before the terms of thefutures contractare realized. Even though most positions are offset near the delivery term, the benefits of the futures contract as a hedging mechanism are still realized.\n\nA futures contract is an agreement to purchase a particular commodity at a specific price on a future date. If a contract is held until the agreed-upon date, the investor could become responsible for accepting the physical delivery of the commodity in question.\n\nThe purpose of offsetting a futures contract on a commodity, for most investors, is to avoid having to physically receive the goods associated with the contract.\n\nIn the options markets, traders often look to offset certain risk exposures, sometimes referred to as their \"Greeks.\" For instance, if an options book is exposed to declines in implied volatility (longvega), a trader may sell related options to offset that exposure.\n\nOr, if an options position is exposed to directional risk, a trader may buy or sell the underlying security to becomedelta neutral. Dynamic hedging (ordelta-gamma hedging) is a strategy employed by derivatives traders to maintain offsetting positions on an ongoing basis.\n\nOne definition of the word offset is \"something that serves to counterbalance or to compensate for something else.\" In all of the businesses in which offsets are used, they are employed to eliminate a loss or some other downside risk inherent in a previous decision.\n\nAn offset in a payment is a reduction in the total amount owed. It occurs when one party successfully argues that the amount due should be reduced due to some compensation owed to the payer.\n\nIf your tax refund is offset, the federal government has seized a portion of your refund to put towards a state or federal debt you owe. Unpaid child support is an example.\n\nIf the initial investment was a purchase, a sale in the same amount is made to neutralize the position. To offset an initial sale, a purchase is made to neutralize the position.\n\nWith futures related to stocks, investors may use hedging to assume an opposing position to manage the risk associated with the futures contract. For example, if you wanted to offset along positionin a stock, you could short-sell an identical number of shares.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Form 40-F Blackberry Ltd.\"\n\nUSA.gov. \"What to do if your tax refund is lower than expected.\"",
