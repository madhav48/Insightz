  "term": "Operating Ratio: Definition and Formula for Calculation",
  "definition": "The term operating ratio refers to the efficiency of a company's management by comparing the totaloperating expense (OPEX)of a company to net sales. The operating ratio shows how efficient a company's management is at keeping costs low while generating revenue or sales. The smaller the ratio, the more efficient the company is at generating revenue vs. total expenses.\n\nThe formula used to calculate the operating ratio is:\n\nOperatingRatio=OperatingExpenses+CostofGoodsSoldNetSalesOperating\\, Ratio = \\frac{Operating\\, Expenses\\, +\\, Cost\\, of\\, Goods\\, Sold}{Net\\, Sales}OperatingRatio=NetSalesOperatingExpenses+CostofGoodsSold\u200b\n\nInvestment analysts have many ways of analyzing company performance. Because it concentrates on core business activities, one of the most popular ways to analyze performance is by evaluating the operating ratio.\n\nA company's operating ratio is commonly used along with itsreturn on assets (ROA)andreturn on equity (ROE)to measure a company's operational efficiency. It is useful to track the operating ratio over time to identify trends in operational efficiency or inefficiency.\n\nAn operating ratio that is going up is viewed as a negative sign. That's because this indicates that operating expenses are increasing relative to sales or revenue. But, if the operating ratio is falling, it means that the company's expenses are decreasing or revenue is increasing. In some cases, it may be some combination of both.\n\nA company may need to implement cost controls for margin improvement if its operating ratio increases over time.\n\nRemember that a company's operating ratio compares its operating expenses to its net sales. While the term net sales refers to a company's gross sales less its returns, allowances, and discounts, its operating expenses are essentially all expenses except taxes and interest payments. Also, companies will typically not includenon-operating expensesin the operating ratio.\n\nOperating expenses are the costs associated with running a business and are not directly tied to the production of a product or service. Operating expenses includeoverhead expenseslike sales, general, and administrative costs. An example of overhead might be the expense of the corporate office for a company because although necessary, it's not directly tied to production. Operating expenses can include:\n\nOperating expenses can also include COGS, which are the expenses directly tied to theproductionof goods and services. However, most companies separate operating expenses from this figure. Therefore, the two costs must be added together to form the numerator in the operating ratio calculation. A company's cost of goods sold can include the following:\n\nRevenue or net sales is the top line of the income statement and is the amount of money a company generates before expenses are taken out. Some companies listrevenueas net sales because they have returns of merchandise from customers whereby they credit the client back, which is deducted from revenue.\n\nAll of these line items are listed on the income statement. Companies must clearly state which expenses are operational and which are designated for other uses.\n\nA limitation of the operating ratio is that it doesn't includedebt. Some companies take on a great deal of debt, meaning they are committed to paying large interest payments, which are not included in the operating expenses figure of the operating ratio. Two companies can have the same operating ratio with vastly different debt levels, so it is important to comparedebt ratiosbefore coming to any conclusions.\n\nAs with any financialmetric, the operating ratio should be monitored over multiple reporting oraccounting periodsto determine if a trend is present. Companies can sometimes cut costs in the short term, thus inflating their earnings temporarily. Investors must monitor costs to see if they're increasing or decreasing over time while also comparing those results to the performance of revenue and profit.\n\nIt's also important to compare the operating ratio with other firms in the same industry. If a company has a higher operating ratio than its peer average, it may indicate inefficiency and vice versa. Finally, as with all ratios, it should be used as part of a full ratio analysis, rather than in isolation.\n\nDon't confuse the terms operating ratio with operating expense ratio. The operating ratio is the comparison of a company's total expenses compared to the revenue or net sales generated. It is used for company analysis in various industries.\n\nThe termoperating expense ratio (OER), on the other hand, is used in the real estate industry. It is used to measure what it costs to operate a property compared to the income that the property generates.\n\nThe operating expense ratio is calculated by dividing a property's operating expense (minusdepreciation) by its gross operating income. The OER is used for comparing the expenses of similar properties.\n\nBelow is the income statement for Apple\u00a0(AAPL), according to the company's second-quarter results for the 2024fiscal year:\n\nWe calculate the numerator of the operating ratio by adding $48.48 billion (COS) + $14.37 billion (operating expenses) for a total of $62.85 billion for the period. The operating ratio is calculated as follows: $62.85 billion \u00f7 $90.75 billion, which equals 0.69 or 69%. The operating ratio forApplemeans that 69% of the company's net sales are operating expenses.\n\nIts operating ratio must be examined over several quarters to get a sense of whether the company is managing its operating costs effectively. Investors can also monitor operating expenses and cost of goods sold separately to determine whether costs are either increasing or decreasing over time.\n\nThe operating ratio is a financial efficiency metric that compares its operating expenses to its net sales. The company's management, analysts, and investors can use the operating ratio to determine how well the company can keep its costs or expenses low while it generates revenue. A low operating ratio means that a company can manage its expenses and keep them low in relation to its sales.\n\nYou'll need a few key financial figures from a company's financial statements to calculate its operating ratio: the operating expenses, cost of goods sold (sometimes called the cost of sales), and net sales.\n\nTo calculate the operating ratio, add the operating expenses and the cost of goods sold, then divide that result by the company's net sales.\n\nOperating expenses are any costs that a company incurs during its core operations. Examples of operating expenses include rent, payroll, insurance, research and development, marketing, equipment, utilities, repairs and inventory costs among others.\n\nMetrics allow corporate management teams, analysts, and investors to understand a company's financial position. Many of these metrics are expressed as ratios, such as the operating ratio. This ratio compares a company's operating expenses (the costs incurred during normal operations) to its net sales. You can determine how efficient a company is when it comes to managing its expenses\u2014a high ratio or one that increases means that its expenses are getting out of hand while a low ratio means that the company is able to keep its costs down while it generates revenue.\n\nApple. \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (Unaudited).\"",
