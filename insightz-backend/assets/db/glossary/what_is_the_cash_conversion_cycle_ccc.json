  "definition": "Ariel Courage is an experienced editor, researcher, and former fact-checker. She has performed editing and fact-checking work for several leading finance publications, including The Motley Fool and Passport to Wall Street.\n\nThe CCC value indicates how efficiently a company uses short-term assets and\u00a0liabilities\u00a0to generate and redeploy cash.\n\nThe cash conversion cycle (CCC) is a metric that measures the amount of time it takes for a company to sell its inventory, collect receivables, and pay its bills. The shorter the cash conversion cycle, the better, and the less time cash is inaccounts receivableor inventory. CCC varies based on the industry or sector analyzed.\n\nMichela Buttignol / Investopedia\n\nThe formula to calculate CCC is:\n\nCCC=DIO+DSO\u2212DPOwhere:DIO=Days\u00a0of\u00a0inventory\u00a0outstanding(also\u00a0known\u00a0as\u00a0days\u00a0sales\u00a0of\u00a0inventory)DSO=Days\u00a0sales\u00a0outstandingDPO=Days\u00a0payables\u00a0outstanding\\begin{aligned} &CCC = DIO + DSO - DPO \\\\ &\\textbf{where:} \\\\ &DIO = \\text{Days of inventory outstanding} \\\\ &\\text{(also known as days sales of inventory)} \\\\ &DSO = \\text{Days sales outstanding} \\\\ &DPO = \\text{Days payables outstanding} \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bCCC=DIO+DSO\u2212DPOwhere:DIO=Days\u00a0of\u00a0inventory\u00a0outstanding(also\u00a0known\u00a0as\u00a0days\u00a0sales\u00a0of\u00a0inventory)DSO=Days\u00a0sales\u00a0outstandingDPO=Days\u00a0payables\u00a0outstanding\u200b\n\nDIO and DSO are associated with the company\u2019s cash inflows, while DPO is linked to cash outflow. DPO is the only negative figure in the calculation.\n\nDIO and DSO are inventory and accounts receivable, respectively, considered short-term assets and positive. DPO is linked to accounts payable, a liability regarded as negative.\n\nThe cash conversion cycle can be used to determine corporate efficiency. It evaluates how efficiently a company\u2019s operations and management are running. Tracking a company\u2019s CCC over multiple quarters will show if it is improving, maintaining, or worsening its operational efficiency.\n\nIf cash is easily available at regular intervals, a company can churn out more sales for profits, as the availability of capital leads to more products to make and sell. A company that acquires inventory on credit results inaccounts payable (AP). A company can also sell products on credit, which results inaccounts receivable (AR).\n\nCash isn\u2019t a factor until the company settles its AP and collects any AR from its customers. Timing is an important aspect of cash management. CCC traces the life cycle of cash used for business activity. It follows cash through inventory and AP, then into expenses for product or service development, to sales and\u00a0AR, and then back into cash in hand.\n\nCCC is also called the net operating cycle or cash cycle.\n\nA company\u2019s cash conversion cycle broadly moves through three distinct stages and draws the following information from a company'sfinancial statements. All figures are available as standard items in the statements filed by a publicly listed company as a part of its annual and quarterly reporting. The number of days in the corresponding period is 365 for a year and 90 for a quarter.\n\nRevenue and\u00a0cost of goods sold\u00a0(COGS) from theincome statement\n\nThe first stage focuses on how long the business takes to sell its inventory. This figure is calculated by using the days inventory outstanding (DIO). A lower value of DIO indicates the company makes sales rapidly with better turnover.\n\nDIO (also known as DSI or days sales of inventory) is calculated based on the COGS or acquiring/manufacturing of the products.\n\nThe second stage focuses on how long it takes the company to collect the cash generated from sales. This figure is calculated using thedays sales outstanding (DSO), which divides average accounts receivable by revenue per day.\n\nA lower value indicates that the company can collect capital in a short time, enhancing its cash position.\n\nThe third stage includes the cash the company owes its current suppliers for the inventory and goods it purchases, and the period in which it must pay off those obligations. This figure is calculated using thedays payable outstanding (DPO), which considers accounts payable.\n\nA higher DPO value means the company holds onto cash longer, thus increasing its investment potential.\n\nCCC represents how quickly a company can convert\u00a0cash\u00a0from investment to returns. The lower the CCC, the better.\n\nThe cash conversion cycle has a selective application to different industrial sectors based on the nature of business operations. The measure affects retailers like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), and Costco (COST), all of which buy and manage inventories and sell them to customers.\n\nHowever, CCC does not apply to companies that don\u2019t needinventory management. For instance, software companies that offer computer programs through licensing can realize sales without the need to manage stock. Similarly, insurance or brokerage companies don\u2019t buy items wholesale for retail, so CCC doesn\u2019t apply to them.\n\nCompanies like retailer Amazon (AMZN) can have negative CCC. Online retailers often receive funds in their accounts for goods that belong to and are served bythird-partysellers who use the online platform. However, these companies don\u2019t pay the sellers immediately after the sale but may follow a monthly or threshold-based payment cycle. This mechanism allows these companies to hold the cash longer, so they may have a negative CCC.\n\nInventory management, sales realization, and payables are the three metrics that affect the CCC. Beyond the monetary value involved, CCC accounts for the time involved in these processes and provides another view of the company\u2019s operating efficiency.\n\nThe CCC value indicates how efficiently a company\u2019s management uses short-term assets and\u00a0liabilities\u00a0to generate and redeploy cash, and gives a peek into the company\u2019s financial health concerning cash management. The figure helps assess theliquidity risklinked to a company\u2019s operations.\n\nA higher, or quicker, inventory turnover decreases the cash conversion cycle. Thus, a better inventory turnover is a positive for the CCC and a company\u2019s overall efficiency.\n\nWhen a company takes too long to collect its accounts receivable, has too much inventory, or pays its expenses too quickly, it lengthens the CCC. A longer CCC means it takes longer to generate cash. When a company collects payments quickly, correctly forecasts inventory needs, or pays its bills slowly, it shortens the CCC. A shorter CCC means that the company is healthier. If two companies have similar values forreturn on equity (ROE)andreturn on assets (ROA), investors may choose the company with the lowest CCC value. It indicates that the company can generate similar returns more quickly.",
