They must take fast and decisive action when necessary, outperform the competition, and inspire others to perform at the highest level possible.\n\nIt can be difficult to place a value on leadership or other qualitative aspects of a company, unlike quantitative managementmetricsthat are commonly tracked and much easier to compare between companies. Leadership can also speak to a more holistic approach, such as the tone a company's management sets or the culture of the company that management establishes.\n\nLeadershipprovides direction for a company and its workers. Employees must know the direction in which the company is headed and who to follow to reach the destination. Leadership involves showing workers how to effectively perform their responsibilities and regularly supervising the completion of their tasks.\n\nLeadership is also about setting a positive example for staff to follow, being excited about the work, being motivated to learn new things, and helping out as needed in both individual and team activities.\n\nLeadership involves setting and achieving goals, taking action, and beating the competition, but it also relates to the tone of the company's management and the kind of culture built for the employees.\n\nEffective leadership requires a strong character. Leaders should exhibit honesty, integrity, trustworthiness, and ethics. They act in line with how they speak and earn the right to be responsible for others' success in the company.\n\nStrong leadership involves clear communication skills. Leaders speak with and listen to staff members, respond to questions and concerns, and are empathetic. They use their communication skills to move the company forward and achieve new levels of success.\n\nTrue leadership sees where the company is headed and plans the steps necessary to get there. Leaders must visualize what's possible, follow industry trends, and take calculated risks to grow the business.\n\nProductive leadership shows optimism and provides positive energy for staff. Good leaders are supportive and truly concerned about the well-being of others. Leaders find answers to challenges, and they reassure and inspire workers when things go awry. Leaders find ways for staff to work together and achieve maximum results efficiently and effectively.\n\nJack Welch was the chief executive officer (CEO) of General Electric Co. from 1981 to 2001. He played an integral part in hundreds of acquisitions in emerging markets and increased GE\u2019s market value from $12 billion to $410 billion at the time of his retirement.\n\nWelch insisted everyone at GE embrace change because the world is constantly changing. Managers and employees had to continuously reinvent themselves and their work to continue evolving company operations and produce greater output.\n\nWelch hired managers who shared his vision of GE, had endless amounts of energy, and were able to encourage employees to stay engaged in their work. He sought managers who created, developed, and refined ideas for the future and found ways to make them a reality. He also insisted that managers work side-by-side with employees as a way of understanding what they were doing and why.\n\nManagers and employees were more empowered as a result of Welch\u2019sleadership style. Products gained higher quality, customer satisfaction, and profits increased dramatically.\n\nLeadership is the ability to motivate others and listen to them, be trustworthy and competent. They must be decisive, have good communication skills, and selflessly understand the goals of the team or organization.\n\nGood leaders are most importantly listeners, visionaries, and decision-makers. The best are humble and fully invested in their followers and business.\n\nGreat leaders demonstrate decisiveness, courage, integrity, dependability, tact, loyalty, and enthusiasm, among many other qualities. Great leaders inspire others to do difficult or seemingly impossible tasks.\n\nLeadership is as much an art as it is a matter of ability. It\u2019s about using your skills, knowledge, abilities, and humanity to guide and encourage others to accomplish organizational goals and professional achievements.\n\nReuters. \"'Neutron' Jack Welch, Who Led GE's Rapid Expansion, Dies at 84.\"",
