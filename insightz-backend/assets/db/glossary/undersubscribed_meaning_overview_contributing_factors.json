  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\n\"Undersubscribed\" refers to a situation in which the demand for an issue of securities such as aninitial public offering(IPO) or another offering of securities is less than the number of shares issued. Undersubscribed offerings are often a matter of overpricing the securities for\u00a0sale or on account of poor marketing of the securities to potential investors.\n\nThis situation is also\u00a0known as an \"underbooking,\" and may be contrasted withoversubscribedwhen demand for an issue exceeds its supply.\n\nAn offering is undersubscribed when the underwriter is not able to get enough interest in the shares for\u00a0sale.\u00a0Because there may not be a firm\u00a0offering price\u00a0at the time, purchasers usually subscribe for a certain number of shares.\u00a0This process allows the\u00a0underwriter to gauge\u00a0demand for the offering (called \u201cindications of interest\u201d) and determine whether a given price\u00a0is fair.\n\nTypically, the goal of a public offering is to sell\u00a0at the exact price at which all the issued shares can be sold to investors, and there is\u00a0neither a shortage nor a surplus of securities. If the demand is too low, the\u00a0underwriter\u00a0and\u00a0issuer\u00a0might lower the price to attract more subscribers. If there is more demand for a public offering than there is supply (shortage), it means a higher price could have been charged, and the issuer could have raised more capital. On the other hand, if the price is too high, not enough investors will subscribe to the issue, and the underwriting company will be left with shares it either cannot sell or must sell at a reduced price, incurring a loss.\n\nOnce the\u00a0underwriter\u00a0is sure it\u00a0will\u00a0sell all of the\u00a0shares\u00a0in the\u00a0offering, it closes the\u00a0offering. Then it purchases all the\u00a0shares\u00a0from the company (if the\u00a0offering\u00a0is a guaranteedoffering), and the\u00a0issuer\u00a0receives the proceeds minus the\u00a0underwriting\u00a0fees. The underwriters then sell the\u00a0shares\u00a0to the subscribers at the\u00a0offering price.\u00a0Sometimes, when underwriters can't find enough investors to purchase IPO shares, they are forced to purchase the shares that could not be sold to the public (also known as \"eating stock\").\n\nAlthough the\u00a0underwriter can influence\u00a0the initial price of the securities, they don't have the final say on all the selling activity on the first day of an IPO. Once the subscribers begin selling on the secondary market, the free-market forces of supply and demand dictate the price, and that can also affect the initial selling price on the IPO. Underwriters usually maintain a secondary\u00a0market\u00a0in the securities they\u00a0issue, which means they agree to purchase or sellsecuritiesout of their own inventories in order to protect\u00a0the price of the securities from extreme volatility.",
