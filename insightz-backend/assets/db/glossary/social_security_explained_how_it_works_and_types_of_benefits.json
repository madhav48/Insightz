  "definition": "Social Security is the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program in the United States. It's run by the Social Security Administration (SSA), a federal agency. It's best known for retirement benefits but it also provides survivor benefits and income for workers who become disabled.\n\nOver 72 million Americans will collect benefits from Social Security in 2024.\n\nSocial Security is an insurance program. Workers pay into the program, typically throughpayroll withholdingfrom their paychecks.Self-employed workerspay Social Security taxes when they file their federal tax returns.\n\nWorkers can earn up to four credits each year. One credit is granted up to $6,920 for every $1,730 earned in 2024, or up to four credits achieved.\n\nThe money goes into two Social Security trust funds: theOld-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) Trust Fundfor retirees and the Disability Insurance (DI) Trust Fund for disability beneficiaries. These two funds are used to pay benefits to people who are currently eligible for them. The money that's not spent remains in the trust funds.\n\nA board of trustees oversees the financial operations of the two Social Security trust funds. Four of the six members are the secretaries of the Departments of Treasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services, and the Commissioner of Social Security. The remaining two members are public representatives appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.\n\nMedicareis the federal health insurance program for Americans who are age 65 and older and some people who are receiving Medicare benefits due to disability. It's also supported through payroll withholding. This money goes into a third trust fund that's managed by theCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).\n\nSocial Security provides benefits to retirees, their survivors, and workers who become disabled.\n\nSpouses and ex-spouses may be eligible for benefits based on the earnings records of their partners or former partners.\n\nWorkers who have paid into the Social Security system for at least 10 years become eligible for early retirement benefits at age 62.Waiting until yourfull retirement age (FRA)(between ages 66 and 67, depending on the year you were born) results in higher monthly benefits.You'll receive even more if you delay collecting retirement benefits until age 70, but benefits don\u2019t continue to increase if you wait any longer than that.\n\nSpousescan also claim benefits based on either their own earnings records or their spouses' records. A divorced spouse who isn't currently married can receive benefits based on an ex-spouse\u2019s earnings record if the marriage lasted at least 10 years.Children of retireescan also receive benefits until they turn 18 or longer if the child is disabled or a student. The cutoff is age 16 if you're caring for a child who isn't your own.\n\nThe amount of your Social Security retirement benefit depends on youraverage indexed monthly earnings (AIME)during your 35 highest-earning years. Amounts will differ significantly among retirees.The average monthly retirement benefit was $1,869.77 as of June 2024.\n\nYour annual amount increases by 8% for each year that you delay collecting benefits if your retirement age is 66 to 67. This starts with the year after you reach your full retirement age and it stops at age 70. Those who begin taking Social Security when they reach the FRA of 66 would receive 100% of theirprimary insurance amount (PIA). They'd receive 108% of their PIA if they delayed taking benefits until the following year. They would receive 132% by delaying until age 70.\n\nThebenefit variesdepending upon when you begin taking it. The maximum monthly benefit for people aged 62 is $2,710 ($32,350 annually) in 2024. It's $4,873 ($58,476 annually) for those who have reached age 70.\n\nA cost-of-living adjustment is made to Social Security benefits annually to keep pace withinflation. It was 8.7% for 2023 and it's 3.2% for 2024.\n\nWorkers can get a projection of their benefits at different retirement ages by using acalculatorthat's provided on the Social Security Administration website.\n\nSocial Security provides a special minimum benefit for long-term low earners that was first enacted in 1972. You must have income for at least 11 years to qualify. The special monthly minimum benefit was $50.90 ($610.80 annually) for December 2023. It increases for each additional year of low-income work, topping out at $1,066.50 or $12,798 annually for people who have worked for 30 years.\n\nPeople who can\u2019t work due to a physical or mental disability that's expected to last for a year or more or result in death may be eligible forSocial Security disability benefits (SSDI). You generally have to meet certain earnings tests to qualify.Family members of disabled workers can also be eligible.\n\nAbout 8.3 million Americans werecollecting SSDIbenefits as of June 2024. The average monthly benefit was $1,398.08 ($16,776.96 annually). The monthly average for disabled workers was $1,537.70 ($18,452.40 annually). Spouses of disabled workers received an average of $420.74 monthly ($5,048.88 annually) and children of disabled workers received $493.19 monthly ($5,918.28 annually).\n\nThe spouse and children of a deceased worker may be eligible for survivor benefits based on the worker\u2019s earnings record. This includes surviving spouses who are age 60 or older or age 50 or older and disabled. A surviving spouse who is caring for a child who is younger than 16 or disabled may be eligible for these benefits as well.\n\nChildren must generally be younger than 18 or disabled to receive benefits. A stepchild, a grandchild, a step-grandchild, or an adopted child may also qualify for benefits under certain circumstances.\n\nParents who are age 62 or older and who were dependent upon a deceased worker for at least half their income may also be eligible to collect benefits. Surviving spouses and minor children are also entitled to a one-time payment of $255 after an eligible worker\u2019s death under some circumstances.\n\nApproximately 5.8 million people were collecting survivor benefits as of June 2024. The average monthly benefit was $1,507.76 or $18,093.12 annually. Survivor benefits are broken down into five categories. Average payments in June 2024 were:\n\nThe Social Security system was created on Aug. 14, 1935, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed theSocial Security Actinto law. The first monthly benefits checks became payable on Jan. 1, 1940. Ida M. Fuller, a retired legal secretary in Vermont, was the first person to collect one. Her check was for $22.54.\n\nThe system and its rules have evolved since 1935. Social Security is one of the largest government programs in the world, paying out hundreds of billions of dollars in benefits each year.\n\nThe number of people who paid Social Security taxes in 2023.\n\nConcerns have been raised about theaging of the U.S. populationand the viability of a system in which fewer active workers willsupport a greater number of retireesas the cost of living continues to rise.\n\nIn its 2024 report, the Social Security Board of Trustees estimated that reserves in the retirement fund (OASI Trust Fund) will become depleted in 2033. This was unchanged from the previous year's projection. Ongoing tax revenue will be enough to pay only 79% of scheduled benefits after that time.\n\nThe report also projected that reserves of the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund that finances Medicare Part A will be depleted in 2036. This is five years later than projected in 2023. The program income will be able to cover 89% of scheduled benefits after 2036.\n\nCongress will have to find ways tofill the gapif these predictions hold. This might mean higher taxes on workers, lower benefits, higher age requirements for retirees, or some combination of these elements.\n\nSocial Security provides monthly benefit payments for qualified retirees, disabled individuals, and for their spouses, children, and survivors. The benefit amount is based on several factors, including earnings history.\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI)is a separate program from Social Security. It provides monthly cash distributions to elderly or disabled people with little to no income to help them meet their basic needs. You can be eligible for both Social Security benefits and SSI.\n\nFull retirement age (FRA) is the age you must reach to be eligible to receive full retirement benefits from Social Security. Your FRA varies depending on when you were born. It's 66 years and two months for those born in 1955 and it gradually increases to age 67 for those born in 1960 or later.\n\nThe enactment of Social Security in 1935 was one of the signature achievements of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s administration. The program remains a cornerstone of most Americans\u2019 retirement, serving more than 72 million people.\n\nBenefit amounts vary depending on income and years of employment. Surviving spouses, children, parents, and disabled workers and their family members may also be eligible to collect benefits in addition to retired workers.\n\nThe average retired worker's benefit amounts to about $20,000 annually so the program shouldn\u2019t be relied on as your sole source of retirement income. It\u2019s important to supplement it with other sources of retirement funding such asindividual retirement accounts (IRAs), employer-sponsored plans such as a401(k)or a403(b), and other savings and investments.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Monthly Statistical Snapshot, June 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Self-Employment Tax (Social Security and Medicare Taxes).\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"How Is Social Security Financed?\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Fact Sheet: 2024 Social Security Changes.\" Page 1.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Social Security Credits.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"What Are the Trust Funds?\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Old-Age & Survivors Insurance Trust Fund.\"\n\nMedicare.gov. \"What's Medicare?\"\n\nMedicare.gov. \"How Is Medicare Funded?\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cSocial Security: The Trust Funds.\u201d Page 1.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Benefits for Your Family.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Starting Your Retirement Benefits Early.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Delayed Retirement Credits.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Social Security Benefit Amounts.\u201d\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Effect of Early or Delayed Retirement on Retirement Benefits.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Workers With Maximum-Taxable Earnings.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Information.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Special Minimum Benefit.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration \"Social Security Benefit Tables,\" Select \"Enter Year for Specific Table: 2023.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \u201cDisability Benefits | How You Qualify.\u201d\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Disability Benefits | Family Benefits.\u201d\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"If You Are the Survivor.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Historical Background and Development of Social Security.\"\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"The 2024 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds.\" Page 2.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Status of the Social Security and Medicare Programs: A Summary of the 2024 Annual Reports.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cSocial Security: The Trust Funds.\u201d Pages 1-2.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Understanding Supplemental Security Income (SSI) - 2024 Edition.\"",
