  "term": "Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act Of 1976 Overview",
  "definition": "The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires large companies to file notifications with theFederal Trade Commissionand the anti-trust division of Department of Justice prior to certainmergers and acquisitionsor tender offers.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe law requires companies intending tomergeto file an HSR Form, also called a \"Notification and Report Form for Certain Mergers and Acquisitions\" and generally known as a premerger notification report.\ufeff\ufeff This gives regulators an opportunity to review the proposed merger based\u00a0onantitrust laws.\n\nPresident Gerald Ford signed the act into law as a set of amendments to existing antitrust laws, including theClayton Antitrust Act.\ufeff\ufeff The Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 is\u00a0also known as the \"HSR Act\" or Public Law 94-435.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nOnce companies file the required forms, a waiting period begins. The waiting period is usually 30 days, or 15 days for cashtender offersor an acquisition inbankruptcy.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nThe transaction can proceed once the waiting period ends or if the government terminates the waiting period early. If regulators see potential anti-competitive issues with the proposed merger, they will request additional information from the companies involved and extend the waiting period; they will negotiate an agreement with the companies to enact measures to restore competition; or they will seek to stop the transaction by filing a preliminaryinjunctionin court.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nUnder the HSR Act, the following tests must be met to require a pre-merger filing:\n\nFor 2020, the base filing threshold for the HSR Act, which determines whether a transaction requires a premerger notification, is $904 million. The statutory size-of-person\u00a0threshold is between $18.8 million and $188 million.\u00a0Alternatively, the\u00a0statutory\u00a0transaction size test that applies to all transactions (even if the \"size-of-person\" threshold is not met) is $376 million.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nHSR forms carry a filing fee that varies depending on the size of a transaction. For example, transactions worth more than $94 million but less than $188 million require a $45,000 filing fee. Transactions valued at more than $188 million but less than $940.1 million incur a $125,000 filing fee. The filing fee is $280,000 for transactions greater than $940.1 million.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\" Accessed Dec. 21, 2020.\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"Antitrust Improvements Acts Notification and Report Form for Certain Mergers and Acquisitions,\" Pages 1-11.
