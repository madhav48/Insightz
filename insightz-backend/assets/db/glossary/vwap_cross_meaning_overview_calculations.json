  "term": "VWAP Cross: Meaning, Overview, Calculations",
  "definition": "A VWAP cross is a trading indicator that occurs when asecurity\u2019sprice crosses the volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\n\nA VWAP cross requires a trader to closely follow a security\u2019s current price and its volume-weighted average price (VWAP).\n\nTechnical systems can typically be programmed to chart a security\u2019s market price and VWAP throughcandlestickpatterns and trendlines drawn on a technical chart. When a security\u2019s price crosses a VWAP trendline then a VWAP cross signal occurs.\n\nTraders typically consider VWAP trendlines similar to resistance and support trendlines. In a VWAP charting pattern, a VWAP trendline is a single trendline charted on a candlestick chart.\n\nThis price pattern focuses on the movement of the VWAP. For a trader using a VWAP trendline, it is important to understand the VWAP\u2019s calculation.\n\n\ufeffVWAP=Security\u00a0Shares\u00a0Bought\u00d7Security\u00a0Share\u00a0PriceSecurity\u00a0Shares\u00a0Bought\\begin{aligned} &\\text{VWAP} = \\frac{ \\text{Security Shares Bought} \\times \\text{Security Share Price} }{ \\text{Security Shares Bought} } \\\\ \\end{aligned}\u200bVWAP=Security\u00a0Shares\u00a0BoughtSecurity\u00a0Shares\u00a0Bought\u00d7Security\u00a0Share\u00a0Price\u200b\u200b\ufeff\n\nVWAP is a moving average trendline that allows a trader to visually chart the affects of a security\u2019svolumein comparison to its price. The VWAP calculation is centered around the volume a security is experiencing from day to day. Other potential volume variables that may be used in conjunction with VWAP include the Positive Volume Index and the Negative Volume Index.\n\nVWAP is a trendline that has two influencing factors: volume and price. Thus, several scenarios can occur from changes in volume and price. Generally VWAP can be a useful trendline to include on a trader\u2019s candlestick chart. VWAP may be trending above or below a security\u2019s candlestick pattern.\n\nInferences from the variables in VWAP are primary drivers of buy and sell signals for traders. The immediate affects of drastic volume\u00a0and price changes that can be seen from following VWAP, make the VWAP trendline a popular trendline for traders to follow. If a security's price is trending below its support level, a rapid increase in volume and price\u00a0simultaneously will cause the\u00a0VWAP trendline to spike significantly, crossing over the security\u2019s current price. This can create a potential bullish buy signal. Adversely, if VWAP has been high and spikes to the downside it can be abearishsell signal indicating that the security is expected to trend lower following the cross pattern. Using a VWAP trendline and VWAP cross can help a technical analyst to detect price movement in securities that may not yet be fully factored into the security\u2019s short-term or long-term price.",
