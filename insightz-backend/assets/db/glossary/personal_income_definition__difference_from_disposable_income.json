  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nPersonal income refers to allincomecollectively received by all individuals or households in a country. Personal income includes compensation from a number of sources, including salaries,wages, and bonuses received from employment or self-employment,dividendsanddistributionsreceived from investments, rental receipts from real estate investments, andprofit sharingfrom businesses.\n\nThe term\u00a0\u201cpersonal income\u201d is sometimes used to refer to the total compensation received by an individual, but this is more aptly referred to as individual income.\u00a0In most jurisdictions, personal income, also calledgross income, issubject to taxation above a certain base amount.\n\nPersonal income has a significant effect on consumer consumption.\u00a0Asconsumer spendingdrives much of the economy, national statistical organizations, economists, and analysts track personal income on a quarterly or annual basis.\n\nIn the United States, theBureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)tracks personal income statistics each month and compares them to numbers from the previous month. The\u00a0agency also breaks out the numbers into categories, such as personal income earned through employment wages, rental income, farming, andsole proprietorships. This allows the agency to make analyses\u00a0about how earning trends are changing.\n\nPersonal income tends to rise during periods of economicexpansionand stagnate or decline slightly duringrecessionarytimes. Rapid economic growth since the 1980s in economies such as China, India, and Brazil has spurred substantial increases in personal incomes for millions of their citizens.\n\nDisposable personal income (DPI)refers to the amount of money that a population has left aftertaxeshave been paid. It differs from personal income in that it takes taxes into account.\n\nAnalyzing after-tax income is important, as this is the money that the population is effectively left with to spend, save, or invest.\n\nOnlyincome taxesare removed from the personal income figure when calculating disposable personal income.\n\nPersonal income is often compared topersonal consumption expenditures (PCEs). PCEs measure changes in the price ofconsumer goodsand services. By taking these changes into account, analysts can ascertainhow changes in personal income affect spending.\n\nTo illustrate, if personal income increases significantly one month, and PCEs also increase, consumers collectively may have more cash in their pockets but also may have to spend more money on basic goods and services.\n\nPersonal income represents all payments made to individuals before tax. It\u2019s not disposable income, which reveals how much people actually have left to spend, save, or invest after income taxes have been deducted.\n\nTo calculate personal income, all income collectively received by individuals or households in a country needs to be tallied up. That is not only gross pay from work but also dividends, rental income, interest, and so forth. Disposable income is then calculated by taking the personal income number and subtracting personal income taxes.\n\nPersonal income focuses on how much money a country\u2019s inhabitants are earning.Gross national income (GNI), on the other hand, reveals the total amount of money earned by a nation\u2019s residents and businesses.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTaxation of U.S. Residents.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cPersonal Income and Outlays, June 2023.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cConsumer Spending.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cPersonal Income.\u201d\n\nThe World Bank. \u201cFour Decades of Poverty Reduction in China,\u201d Pages 20-23.\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cDisposable Personal Income.\u201d\n\nU.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. \u201cIncome & Savings.\u201d",
