  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nCum laude, a Latin term that means \"with honor,\" is an academic distinction awarded by U.S. colleges and universities to graduates who excel.\n\nThe Latin term cum laude means \"with distinction,\" \"with praise,\" or \"with honor.\" In the U.S. many colleges and universities use it to distinguish students who achieve academic excellence.\n\nCum laude is one of three academic designations awarded to students in the United States. The other two aresumma cum laude(which indicates the greatest distinction) andmagna cum laude(which indicates great distinction).\n\nCum laude signifies a distinguished level of academic achievement. An even greater distinction ismagna cum laude, which means \"with high honor\" or \"with high praise.\" Summa cum laude bestows the greatest honor on its recipient.\n\nThe guidelines by which each level of academic honor is achieved differ atacademic institutions. Each college or university outlines its expectations for each award.\n\nStudents who receive Latin honors are typically recognized during graduation ceremonies, and the designation appears on the student's diploma.\n\nStudents graduating with honors may be allowed to wear a certain symbol, like a sash or a tassel on their mortarboard.\n\nThe criteria for earning Latin honors may include a highgrade point average (GPA), class ranking, a particular number of credit hours completed, and other academic achievements.\n\nSome universities bestow\u00a0Latin honors at certain GPA levels. Typically, a GPA of 3.5 or higher is required to receive the cum laude designation, with higher GPAs necessary for magna cum laude and summa cum laude. The designation is based only on an individual student's final GPA.\n\nOther universities reserve Latin honors for a stated percentage of each graduating class. That means only a top percentage of a class may receive any honors. Even smaller percentages of the student body may be awarded\u00a0the magna cum laude and summa cum laude honors designations.\n\nAn outstanding GPA alone may not be enough to earn these honors atIvy Leagueuniversities and other highly competitive schools.\n\nFaculty committees also consider students' academic records and other academic achievements, such as outstanding papers, published articles, and well-researched assignments. The professors will usually recommend honors for exceptional students.\n\nWhile cum laude represents a distinguished level of achievement, magna cum laude is one level above. Meaning \u201cwith great praise\u201d in Latin, magna cum laude differs from summa cum laude, which in turn means \u201chighest praise\u201d or \u201chighest honor.\u201d Summa cum laude represents the highest level of academic distinction. These designations may be awarded due to different factors such as GPA, class ranking, or additional academic achievements.\n\nConsider the University of Pennsylvania, where students must have a GPA of 3.4 to graduate cum laude. By contrast, New York University will award a student cum laude if their GPA falls within the next 15% of the previous year's graduating class, and some colleges within the university have their own ranking system. Ultimately, how and when these designations are awarded can vary widely across academic institutions.\n\nMost students need to have an above-average to high grade point to earn the cum laude honor. It requires a lot of dedication, effort, and time to outperform many peers in an academic class to achieve such a distinction.\n\nCum laude is a Latin term used at educational institutions as a mark of distinction, representing honorable excellence in coursework. It is determined by GPA or other academic achievements.\n\nJob candidates will often include their cum laude designation on their resumes to demonstrate their academic success.\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. \"Graduation Honors.\"\n\nNew York University. \"Latin Honors Archive.\"",
