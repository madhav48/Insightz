It indicates whether a company\u2019s cash flow is sufficient to meet itslong-term liabilities. An unfavorable ratio can indicate some likelihood that a company will default on its debt obligations.\n\nA solvency ratio is one of many metrics used to determine whether a company can stay solvent in the long term. A solvency ratio is a comprehensive measure of solvency, as it measures a firm's actual cash flow, rather than net income, by adding backdepreciationand other non-cash expenses to assess a company\u2019s capacity to stay afloat.\n\nIt measures this cash flow capacity versus all liabilities rather than onlyshort-term debt. This way, a solvency ratio assesses a company's long-term health by evaluating its repayment ability for its long-term debt and the interest on that debt.\n\nSolvency ratios vary from industry to industry. A company\u2019s solvency ratio should, therefore, be compared with its competitors in the same industry rather than viewed in isolation.\n\nA solvency ratio terminology is also used when evaluating insurance companies, comparing the size of their capital relative to the premiums written, and measuring the risk an insurer faces on claims it cannot cover.\n\nThe main solvency ratios are the debt-to-assets ratio, the interest coverage ratio, the equity ratio, and the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio. These measures may be compared withliquidity ratios, which consider a firm's ability to meet short-term obligations rather than medium- to long-term ones.\n\nTheinterest coverage ratiois calculated as follows:\n\nInterest\u00a0Coverage\u00a0Ratio=EBITInterest\u00a0Expenses\\text{Interest Coverage Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{EBIT}}{\\text{Interest Expenses}}Interest\u00a0Coverage\u00a0Ratio=Interest\u00a0ExpensesEBIT\u200b\n\nThe interest coverage ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payments with its available\u00a0earnings. In other words, it measures the margin of safety a company has for paying interest on its debt during a given period.\n\nThe higher the ratio, the better. If the ratio falls to 1.5 or below, it may indicate that a company will have difficulty meeting the interest on its debts.\n\nThedebt-to-assets ratiois calculated as follows:\n\nDebt-to-Assets\u00a0Ratio=DebtAssets\\text{Debt-to-Assets Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Debt}}{\\text{Assets}}Debt-to-Assets\u00a0Ratio=AssetsDebt\u200b\n\nThe debt-to-assets ratio measures a company's total debt to its total assets. It measures a company's leverage and indicates how much of the company is funded by debt versus assets, and therefore, its ability to pay off its debt with its available assets. A higher ratio, especially above 1.0, indicates that a company is significantly funded by debt and may have difficulty meeting its obligations.\n\nTheshareholder equity ratiois calculated as follows:\n\nSER=TSETotal\u00a0assetswhere:SER\u2063=\u2063Shareholder\u00a0equity\u00a0ratioTSE\u2063=\u2063Total\u00a0shareholder\u00a0equity\\begin{aligned}&\\text{SER}=\\frac{\\text{TSE}}{\\text{Total assets}}\\\\\\textbf{where:}\\\\&\\text{SER}\\!=\\!\\text{Shareholder equity ratio}\\\\&\\text{TSE}\\!=\\!\\text{Total shareholder equity}\\end{aligned}where:\u200bSER=Total\u00a0assetsTSE\u200bSER=Shareholder\u00a0equity\u00a0ratioTSE=Total\u00a0shareholder\u00a0equity\u200b\n\nThe equity ratio, or equity-to-assets, shows how much of a company is funded by equity as opposed to debt. The higher the number, the healthier a company is. The lower the number, the more debt a company has on its books relative to equity.\n\nThedebt-to-equity(D/E) ratio is calculated as follows:\n\nDebt\u00a0to\u00a0Equity\u00a0Ratio=Debt\u00a0OutstandingEquity\\text{Debt to Equity Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Debt Outstanding}}{\\text{Equity}}Debt\u00a0to\u00a0Equity\u00a0Ratio=EquityDebt\u00a0Outstanding\u200b\n\nThe D/E ratio is similar to the debt-to-assets ratio in that it indicates how a company is funded, in this case, by debt. The higher the ratio, the more debt a company has on its books, meaning the likelihood of default is higher. The ratio looks at how much of the debt can be covered by equity if the company needs to liquidate.\n\nDon't just look at one ratio from one period; most financial ratios are able to tell more of a story when you look at the same ratio over time or look at the same ratio across similar companies.\n\nSolvency ratios and liquidity ratios are similar but have someimportant differences. Both of these categories offinancial ratioswill indicate the health of a company. The main difference is that solvency ratios offer a longer-term outlook on a company, whereas liquidity ratios focus on the shorter term.\n\nSolvency ratios look at all assets of a company, including long-term debts such as bonds with maturities longer than a year. Liquidity ratios, on the other hand, look at just the mostliquid assets, such as cash andmarketable securities, and how those can be used to cover upcoming obligations in the near term.\n\nIf an investor wants to know whether a company will be able to pay its bills next year, they are often most interested in looking at the liquidity of the company. If a company is illiquid, it won't be able to pay its short-term bills as they come due. On the other hand, investors more interested in a long-term health assessment of a company would want to analyze solvency ratios.\n\nA company may have a low debt amount, but if its cash management practices are poor and accounts payable are surging, as a result its solvency position may not be as solid as would be indicated by measures that include only debt.\n\nIt's important to look at a variety of ratios to comprehend the truefinancial healthof a company, as well as understand the reason that a ratio is what it is. Furthermore, a number itself won't give much of an indication. A company needs to be compared to its peers, particularly the strong companies in its industry, to determine if the ratio is an acceptable one or not.\n\nFor example, an airline company will have more debt than a technology firm just by the nature of its business. An airline company has to buy planes, pay for hangar space, and buy jet fuel; costs that are significantly more than a technology company will ever have to face.\n\nBelow is a screenshot of Amazon's financial position at the end of 2024. At the end of Dec. 31, 2024, Amazon had $624.9 billion of total company assets:\n\nAlthough total debt is not explicitly shown on the financial statement, it can easily be calculated as the difference between total assets and total stockholders' equity (both of which are shown). Using subtraction, Amazon's debt was $338.9 billion at the end of 2024 and $326.0 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nOne can get a sense of Amazon's solvency by comparing last year's debt-to-equity ratio to this year's ratio. The ratios for each year are:\n\nFrom these two calculations, one can assess that Amazon's long-term solvency increased, and the company's financial position became less risky over the course of the year. This is because the company now has proportionally less debt on its books compared to equity.\n\nIn another example, Amazon's debt-to-assets ratio decreased.\n\nThis indicates that debt now makes up a smaller portion of the company's total assets. While debt increased slightly, total assets grew at a faster rate, leading to an improved ratio. This aligns with the earlier observation that Amazon's financial leverage decreased, as seen in the decline of its debt-to-equity ratio.\n\nThis means that in 2023, Amazon had 62 cents of debt for every $1 of assets, or in other words, 62% of its assets were financed through debt. In 2024, while Amazon's total debt increased slightly, its total assets grew at a faster pace, reducing the debt-to-asset ratio to 0.54. That means only 54% of the company's assets are now financed by debt.\n\nSlight changes like this may not be significant on their own, but consistent long-term trends or major year-over-year shifts can reveal how effectively a company is managing its capital structure and financial risk.\n\nA solvency ratio measures how well a company\u2019s cash flow can cover its long-term debt. Solvency ratios are a key metric for assessing the financial health of a company and can be used to determine the likelihood that a company will default on its debt. Solvency ratios differ from liquidity ratios, which analyze a company\u2019s ability to meet its short-term obligations.\n\nSolvency ratios measure a company\u2019s cash flow, which includes non-cash expenses and depreciation, against all debt obligations. For instance, consider the debt-to-assets ratio, a popular metric that measures the degree to which a company\u2019s assets are financed by debt, where debt-to-assets equals total debt divided by total assets. Another common solvency ratio, the debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio, shows how financially leveraged a company is, where debt-to-equity equals total debt divided by total equity.\n\nSolvency ratios\u2014also referred to as leverage ratios\u2014analyze the impact on long-term obligations and a company\u2019s ability to continue operating over a longer horizon. By contrast, liquidity ratios look at two main objectives: a company\u2019s ability to pay for short-term liabilities due under a year and the ability to quickly sell assets to raise cash.\n\nA high solvency ratio is usually good as it means the company is usually in better long-term health compared to companies with lower solvency ratios. On the other hand, a solvency ratio that looks too favorable may show that the company is not utilizing potentially low-cost debt as much as it should. While solvency is mostly used as a barometer of financial health, and higher is good, it is also used to evaluate some of the operational efficiencies where higher is not always better.\n\nSolvency is related to debt because it's the measurement of how well a company will be able to pay off its debts. In a lot of cases, it makes sense for a company to borrow money. In other cases, it may be cheaper to take on debt rather than issue stock. In the long run, however, it is important that a company keeps track of its future obligations and whether it will be able to pay long-term debt as it comes due. Although solvency and debt are not the same thing, they are very closely related.\n\nSolvency ratios are financial measurements that usually look at a company's total assets, total debt, or total equity to better understand the company's financing structure.\n\nThis financial structure plays a critical part in knowing whether the company will be able to pay its long-term debts as they come due and have enough money in the long run. The most common solvency ratios are the debt-to-equity ratio, the debt-to-assets ratio, and the interest coverage ratio.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Amazon.com, Inc.
