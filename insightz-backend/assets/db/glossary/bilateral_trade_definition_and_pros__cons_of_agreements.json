  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nBilateral trade is the exchange of goods between two nations promoting trade and investment. When engaged in bilateral trade, participating countries may agree to\u00a0reduce or eliminatetariffs, import quotas, export restraints, and other trade barriers to encourage trade and investment.\n\nIn the United States, the Office of Bilateral Trade Affairs minimizes trade deficits by negotiatingfree trade agreementswith new countries, supporting and improving existing trade agreements, promoting economic development abroad, and other actions.\n\nBilateral trade agreements aim to expand access between two countries\u2019 markets and increase theireconomic growth. Standardized business operations also prevent one country from stealing another\u2019s innovative products, dumping goods at a small cost, or using unfair subsidies. Bilateral trade agreements standardize regulations, labor standards, and environmental protections.\n\nThe United States has signed bilateral trade agreements with 20 countries, some of which include Israel, Jordan, Australia, Chile, Singapore, Bahrain, Morocco, Oman, Peru, Panama, and Colombia.\n\nThe Dominican Republic-Central America FTR (CAFTA-DR) is a free trade agreement signed between the United States and smaller economies of Central America, as well as the Dominican Republic. The Central American countries are El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Honduras.NAFTA replaced the bilateral agreements with Canada and Mexico in 1994.The U.S. renegotiated NAFTA under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which went into effect in 2020.\n\nCompared to multilateral trade agreements, bilateral trade agreements are negotiated more easily, because only two nations are party to the agreement. Bilateral trade agreements initiate and reap trade benefits faster than multilateral agreements.\n\nWhen negotiations for a multilateral trade agreement are unsuccessful, many nations will negotiate bilateral treaties instead. However, new agreements often result in competing agreements between other countries, eliminating the advantages the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) confers between the original two nations.\n\nBilateral trade agreements also expand the market for a country's goods. The United States vigorously pursued free trade agreements with a number of countries under the Bush administration during the early 2000s.\n\nIn addition to creating a market for U.S. goods, the expansion helped spread the mantra oftrade liberalizationand encouraged open borders for trade. However, bilateral trade agreements can skew a country's markets when largemultinational corporations, which have significantcapitaland resources to operate at scale, enter a market dominated by smaller players. As a result, the latter might need to close shop when they are competed out of existence.\n\nIn October 2014, the United States and Brazil settled a longstanding cotton dispute in theWorld Trade Organization (WTO). Brazil terminated the case, relinquishing its rights to countermeasures against U.S. trade or further proceedings in the dispute.\n\nBrazil also agreed to not bring new WTO actions against U.S. cotton support programs while the current U.S. Farm Bill was in force, or against agricultural export credit guarantees under the GSM-102 program. Because of the agreement, American businesses were no longer subject to countermeasures such as increased tariffs totaling hundreds of millions of dollars annually.\n\nIn March 2016, the U.S. government and the government of Peru reached an agreement removing barriers to U.S. beef exports to Peru that had been in effect since 2003.\n\nThe agreement opened one of the fastest-growing markets in Latin America. In 2015, the United States exported $25.4 million in beef and beef products to Peru. Removal of Peru\u2019s certification requirements, known as the export verification program, assured American ranchers expanded market access.\n\nThe agreement reflected the U.S. negligible risk classification for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\n\nThe United States and Peru agreed to amendments in certification statements making beef and beef products from federally inspected U.S. establishments eligible for export to Peru, rather than just beef and beef products from establishments participating in the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) Export Verification (EV) programs under previous certification requirements.\n\nBilateral trade and multilateral trade are very similar concepts. As mentioned above, bilateral trade refers to trade between two specific countries, while multilateral trade is conducted across three or more. Bilateral trade agreements are easier to negotiate, as they only require the approval of two states. Multilateral trade agreements have to strike a more delicate balance across the economic needs and wants of multiple countries.\n\nThe most immediate advantage of bilateral trade is that it affords both participating countries easier access to expanded markets. Consider the case of an electronics producer that has successfully sold and marketed devices to a significant portion of the population in the region in which it's based. To further drive revenue, it wants to begin engaging in commerce internationally. If confronted with trade barriers such as high import fees or duties, it may not be able to make a profit abroad. A bilateral trade agreement that eliminates or reduces such frictions can provide businesses in both participating countries with significantly increased economic opportunity. It may also give consumers in both regions more choice.\n\nWhen a bilateral trade agreement is set, participating countries have access to a greatly expanded market. However, not everyone benefits from this change equally. In particular, larger firms are generally better situated than their smaller counterparts.\n\nConsider a hypothetical multinational food business headquartered in the U.S. and with subsidiaries located across the world. If the U.S. established a new bilateral trade agreement that eliminated barriers with another country, the multinational might be much better poised to take advantage of this new market, as it would likely have the necessary capital to scale up production and transport.\n\nNot only might the multinational's U.S. competitors struggle to do the same, but local businesses in the other country might also find it difficult to compete with the production, marketing, and human resources of the multinational. Ultimately, this could lead to a system in which there are some winners and losers resulting from the new agreement.\n\nBilateral trade refers to commerce conducted between two countries. It is typically facilitated by bilateral trade agreements, which are designed to eliminate common barriers such as tariffs, quotas, or other restraints.\n\nBilateral trade agreements can help to standardize business regulations and practices across different regions and increase economic strength of participating nations. However, expanded markets may benefit larger firms over smaller players, leading to closures of some businesses.\n\nU.S. Department of State. \"Bilateral Trade Affairs.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"Free Trade Agreements.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"CAFTA-DR (Dominican Republic-Central America FTA).\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative (Archive). \"North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative. \"United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\"\n\nThe White House: Bush Administration. \"President Bush Expanded and Enforced Trade Agreements to Open New Markets for American Products.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative (Archive). \"United States and Brazil Reach Agreement to End WTO Cotton Dispute.\"\n\nOffice of the United States Trade Representative (Archive). \"United States Secures Full Access for U.S. Beef and Beef Products to Peru.\"",
