Krugerrands are among the most frequently traded gold coins in the world market.\n\nThe coins have legal tender status in South Africa, although Krugerrands were never assigned a rand (ZAR) value. Krugerrands were designed to derive their value exclusively from the price of gold at the time they are traded. If the price of gold changes, so does the price of Krugerrands.\n\nThe face of a Krugerrand coin bears the image of Paul Kruger, who was president of the South African Republic from 1883 to 1900. The coin\u2019s name comes from combining Paul Kruger\u2019s surname with \u201crand,\u201d South Africa\u2019s national currency. The reverse of the coin portrays a galloping springbok antelope, which is one of South Africa\u2019s national symbols.Paul Kruger held office when one of the world\u2019s most profitable mines, Durban Deep, was founded in 1896. He also was president during the Witwatersrand Gold Rush, which led to the founding of Johannesburg, one of South Africa\u2019s largest cities.\n\nThe Johannesburg\u00a0Stock Exchange (JSE) trades in Krugerrands through a well-regulated secondary market in the same way as any listed equity market instrument, with quoted prices based on the weight of the coins.New Krugerrands are issued by theSouth African Reserve Bank(SARB), where they can be redeemed.Because of its legal tender status in South Africa, the Krugerrand was minted to be more resilient to wear than the 24-karat gold coins used for decoration medals. The Krugerrand is made of 22 karats, or 91.67%, gold, with 8.33% copper alloy.\n\nwestphalia/iStock / Getty Images Plus\n\nWhen Krugerrands were minted in 1967, the United States did not permit its citizens to own gold bullion, but it did permit ownership of foreign coins, so the Krugerrand could be bought and sold in the U.S. As the consciousness of South Africa\u2019s apartheid\u2014that country's system of racial segregation\u2014policies grew, the Krugerrand suffered from diminished interest.\n\nDuring the 1970s and '80s, numerous Western countries banned the import of Krugerrands as part of enforced economic sanctions against South Africa because of apartheid.The United States banned the import of Krugerrands in 1985.These economic sanctions ended in the West in 1994when apartheid was abandoned by South Africa.\u00a0However, many U.S. investors did not realize that the ban had been lifted, which caused low volumes of U.S. imports of Krugerrands.\n\nIn 1970, South Africa was the largest gold producer in the world, holding more than 75% of the world\u2019s gold reserves.Throughout the 1970s, Krugerrands quickly became the leading choice for gold investors. By 1980, at the peak of the gold market, the Krugerrand overwhelmingly dominated other gold investments, accounting for 90% of the world\u2019s gold-coin market.\n\nIn 1994, following the end of apartheid, production of the Krugerrand plummeted. Since then, South Africa's gold production bounced back, but it has never returned to its heyday levels of the 1970s and '80s. In 2016, the nation\u2019s gold output had dropped by 85% since 1980, and South Africa produced just 6% percent of the world\u2019s gold.\n\nToday, Krugerrands\u00a0continue to suffer. As the graph below displays, South Africa's gold production fell by more than 30% between December 2018\u201319, extending its longest run of contractions since the2007\u201308 financial crisis.\n\nKrugerrands remain a popular investment forgold investorsin part because of their value and small size, which makes for easy storage. Krugerrands appeal to professional and private investors who wish to make a direct investment in gold bullion, hedge their portfolios against the U.S. dollar, or further diversify their portfolio.\n\nInvestors continue to buy gold because of the proven longevity of its value. Many gold investors consider this precious metal a safe investment that will retain its value even in an economic collapse. Owning a tangible asset appeals to some investors, who may put greater trust in physical coins or bars than in securities investments that exist only on paper.\n\nIf you are interested in buying Krugerrands you should have a secure place in which to store them. You also should be wary of scammers, seek\u00a0areputable gold dealer, and brush up on your state\u2019s tax laws, which could include a sales tax on gold. Here are some features of investing in gold that some investors could find attractive:\n\nKrugerrands can be purchased from coin dealers in person or online. All Krugerrand coins, even ones minted during the time when international sanctions were imposed on South Africa, are now legal to own, buy, or sell.\n\nA Krugerrand coin contains one ounce of gold, and weighs a total of 1.09 ounces due to the trace presence of copper alloy that makes the coins more durable.\n\nSince a Krugerrand contains one ounce of pure gold, the price of one of these coins closely follows the market price of gold, which is quoted per-ounce.\n\nMinerals Council South Africa. \"Fact Sheets,\" Download \"Commemorative Booklet #MakingMiningMatter,\" Page 28.\n\nSouth African Government. \"South African Reserve Bank Act, 1989,\" Page 30.\n\nScottsdale Bullion & Coin. \"Gold Krugerrand Coins.\"\n\nKrugerrand. \"The World\u2019s Most Traded Bullion Coin.\"\n\nJohannesburg Stock Exchange. \"Example Product.\"\n\nSouth African Reserve Bank. \"Gold Coins Purchased From the Public.\"\n\nRand Refinery. \"Products: Krugerrands.\"\n\nYale University. \"Sanctions on South Africa: What Did They Do?\" Page 7.\n\nRonald Reagan Presidential Library & Museum. \"Message to the Congress Reporting on the Economic Sanctions Against South Africa.\"\n\nThe Baltimore Sun. \"With Fall of Apartheid, Krugerrands Regain Luster.\"\n\nInternational Monetary Fund. \"1971 Annual Report,\" Page 143.\n\nThe Washington Post. \"South Africa\u2019s gold industry, like its economy, is crumbling.\" Accessed July 7, 2021.\n\nMonex. \"Gold South African Krugerrand Price Charts.\"",
