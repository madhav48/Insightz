  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nA national Insurance contribution (NIC) is a tax paid by British employees and employers to fund government benefits programs. Contributions are made throughpayroll deductionsand are based on several criteria, including an employee's age and earnings. Individuals need a National Insurance number issued by the federal government before NICs can be made. The NIC program works just like theFederal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA)system in the U.S.\n\nNational Insurance is a tax paid by individuals and corporations in the United Kingdom. It is awithholding taxjust like FICA in the United States. Employees and employers pay a share of the National Insurance contributions, which the employer collects through payroll deductions. Self-employed individuals pay both portions. Employers regularly report these contributions to the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nIn order to begin paying, individuals must have a National Insurance number, which is just like aSocial Security number (SSN). Taxpayers can apply for a NIN online. This number is unique to an individual, so contributions are recorded against only one taxpayer's name.\n\nTaxpayers must make NICs as long as they meet the following criteria:\n\nEmployees can also make additional voluntary contributions so they can qualify for a higherpensionamount in the future. Self-employed people and British citizens working outside the country can also make voluntary contributions toward pension eligibility.\n\nNICs are collected to fund a number of benefit programs. This is done by dividing employees into classes. The table below highlights these classes and the benefit programs they fund.\n\nThe basic State Pension in the U.K. is \u00a3156.20 each week.The full new State Pension is \u00a3203.85 per week.\n\nEmployees are divided into different categories:\n\nThere are other categories for taxpayers who work in freeports. Individuals who don't make NICs are categorized with the letter X.\n\nEach of these classifications is assigned a different rate based on the amount they earn per week:\n\nAn employee who works or expects to work fewer than 35 years will not qualify for the maximum pension benefit without making additional voluntary payments. Payouts may be higher for employees who make voluntary contributions or defer taking the benefit until a later age.\n\nBritish employees pay the National Insurance from age 16 through the official retirement age, which is age 65 for most but is being gradually increased to age 67. The system began with the\u00a0National Insurance Act of 1911 and was limited to a government-fundedunemploymentbenefit.\n\nAt that time,health insuranceand pension benefits were administered by private trade unions and approved societies or professional associations. An Old Age Pension was paid to people over age 70, at a time when only one in four Britons lived that long.\n\nWorld War II was nearing its end by the time the government began contemplating an expansion of the social safety net in Great Britain. In March 1943, Prime Minister\u00a0Winston Churchill,\u00a0in a radio broadcast, promised a system of \"national compulsory insurance for all classes for all purposes from the cradle to the grave.\"\n\nThe system was not fully in place until 1948.A series of expansions in the 20th century extended its reach to add funding for the National Health Service, the public retiree pension plan, and unemployment benefits.\n\nA National Insurance number in the U.K. is a unique identifier assigned to one particular individual. The number is used to administer the country's National Insurance system and is similar to a Social Security number in the United States. A person's NI number ensures that National Insurance contributions are recorded against their name. Individuals can also use it to reference issues with the social security system.\n\nIndividuals must meet certain eligibility criteria before they can begin making National Insurance contributions. Employees must be 16 or older and must meet minimum income thresholds. Employers generally withhold employee contributions through payroll deductions. Self-employed individuals are responsible for making their own contributions. Employers submit regular accounts of employee contributions to HMRC and completeForm P45when an employee is terminated.\n\nNational Insurance contributions made by employees in the United Kingdom are used to fund various social benefit programs. These include the country's pension system, unemployment benefits, and sickness benefits, among others.\n\nMany countries have systems in place to fund social benefit programs. The National Insurance system in the United Kingdom relies on contributions from employees over the age of 16 to pay for retiree pensions, unemployment benefits, and other related social programs. Individuals must have a valid National Insurance number before contributions can be made. National Insurance contributions are similar to the FICA system in the United States, which funds Social Security and Medicare.\n\nPayroll information to report to HMRC.
