  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nUnderwriting fees aremoniescollected by underwriters for performingunderwritingservices. Underwriters work in a variety of markets including investments, mortgages, and insurance. In each situation, the underwriter's job varies slightly, yet each collects underwriting fees in exchange for his or her underwriting services.\n\nIncapital markets, underwriting fees are collected by underwriters who administer the issuing and distributing of certainfinancial instruments. When a company\u00a0issues\u00a0stock,\u00a0bonds,\u00a0or other publicly traded securities, for instance, it hires an\u00a0underwriter.\n\nThe\u00a0issuing company\u00a0and the underwriter work closely together to determine the price of an\u00a0offering. After determining the offer structure, underwriters assemble\u00a0a group of\u00a0investment\u00a0banks and brokerage firms that commit to selling a certain percentage of the\u00a0offering. After an\u00a0underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities and the cost of holding them on its books until\u00a0they can be\u00a0sold.\u00a0Once the underwriter knows it\u00a0will\u00a0sell all of the\u00a0shares\u00a0in the offering, it closes the offering by purchasing\u00a0all the\u00a0shares\u00a0from the company (if the offering is a guaranteed offering), and the\u00a0issuer\u00a0receives the proceeds minus the underwriting fees,\u00a0usually\u00a03.5\u00a0to 7 percent\u00a0of the amount of\u00a0capital\u00a0being raised.\n\nUnderwriters orunderwriter\u00a0syndicatesearn underwriting fees for doing\u00a0three things: negotiating and managing the\u00a0offering, assuming the risk of buying the securities (if nobody else\u00a0will), and managing the\u00a0sale\u00a0of the\u00a0shares.\n\nA mortgage underwriter earns underwriting fees by evaluating and verifying mortgage loan applications\u00a0and either approving or denying the loan.\n\nAn underwriting fee for the service of evaluating the loan application for approval is a nonrecurringfee or finance chargethat the lender may charge in lieu of anorigination fee, or in addition to it.\u00a0Origination fees pay for numerous costs associated with obtaining a\u00a0loan and could\u00a0include administrative services, such as loan processing and mortgage broker fees. Other loan fees can\u00a0include an appraisal, a credit report, flood certification, and a tax service fee. When charged apart from origination, underwriting costs between $400 and $900, depending on the lender and loan type.\n\nInsurance underwriters\u00a0collect underwriting fees for identifying and calculating a policyholder's risk of loss\u00a0and by writing the policies to cover these risks.\u00a0An insurance underwriter's job is to protect the company's\u00a0book of business\u00a0from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue\u00a0insurance policies\u00a0at a premium that is appropriate for the risk exposure.",
