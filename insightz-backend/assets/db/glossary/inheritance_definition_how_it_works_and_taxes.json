  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nAn inheritance is the set of assets that an individual bequeaths to their loved ones upon their death. It may be subject to inheritance taxes. A recipient may inherit the assets as anheir, or they may be named as abeneficiaryin a will, retirement plan, or life insurance policy.\n\nIn most countries, inheritance assets are subject toinheritance taxes, where beneficiaries may find themselves saddled with tax liabilities. The rates of an inheritance tax depend on a host of factors, including a beneficiary\u2019s state of residence, the value of the inheritance, and the beneficiary\u2019s relationship to thedecedent.\n\nThe six U.S. states that levy inheritance taxes are Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. In most of these states, any assets that are bequeathed to a spouse are exempt from inheritance taxes. In some cases, children are also exempt, or they may face lower rates of taxation.\n\nAn inheritance tax differs from an estate tax, which is a levy on\u00a0the transfer of a deceased person\u2019s estate. But estate taxes do not apply to assets left to a spouse or to federally recognized\u00a0charities, in most cases.\n\nBeneficiarieswith no familial ties to the decedent are typically subject to higher inheritance taxes than beneficiaries who are closely related to the decedent.\n\nConsider the following example: In Nebraska in 2024, a parent, grandparent, sibling, child, or other lineal descendants (including adopted children)\u00a0paid\u00a0an inheritance tax of 1% on assets exceeding $100,000. By contrast, relatives who were further removed from the decedent paid\u00a0higher inheritance taxes up to a rate of 15%.\n\nLife insurance is not subject to inheritance taxes.\n\nProbateis the legal process by which a decedent\u2019s assets are divided among their heirs and beneficiaries, according to their will and state laws. If the decedent died with a will, that will is reviewed by a probate court, which appoints anexecutorfor the decedent\u2019s estate. The executor is then responsible for dividing theestateamong the people named in the will and anycreditors. Any disputes are resolved through probate court.\n\nA person who dies without a will, or with an invalid will, is said to have diedintestate. In this circumstance, the probate court will appoint an administrator of the estate to divide the assets according to state laws.\n\nThere is a distinction between a beneficiary and an heir. Beneficiaries are individuals named in a will, while heirs are people who are entitled to receive a decedent\u2019s property by intestate succession, a set of rules created tosort out inheritance mattersin the absence of a will.\n\nAn inheritance tax is a state tax on the estate of a decedent. In most cases, inheritance taxes are based on the size of the inheritance and the beneficiary\u2019s relationship to the deceased.\n\nYou canreduce the inheritance tax burdenon your beneficiaries by placing your assets in atrustor by gifting assets to your beneficiaries while you are still living. Another option is to take out alife insurancepolicy and name your heirs as beneficiaries. Life insurance payouts are not subject to inheritance taxes.\n\nIf you inherit a401(k)from a spouse, the conventional wisdom is to roll the sum into your ownindividual retirement account (IRA). This allows you to defer taxes until you start taking distributions.\n\nIf you inherit a 401(k) from a parent, it\u2019s a little more complicated. The first step should be to consult the plan documents to determine what options are available. Most advisors caution against a lump-sum distribution, which would incur greater taxes than you would otherwise. A five- or 10-year distribution allows you to spread out the tax burden and allowsinterest to compound. Some plans also allow distributions over your calculatedlife expectancy, under very specific conditions.\n\nIf you receive an inheritance within 180 days of filingChapter 13 bankruptcy, your trustee may require you to pay the sum into your bankruptcy plan. It\u2019s more complicated for inheritances received more than 180 days after a bankruptcy filing\u2014most courts have ruled that these windfalls should be repaid to creditors, but some courts have allowed the inheritor to keep the money.\n\nAccording to the U.S. government, the first step to finding unclaimed assets is to check your state\u2019sunclaimed moneyoffice.This is where the state collects records of unpaid wages, unclaimed bank accounts, and heirs who could not be located.\n\nIf you are uncertain about the contents of a will, the first step is to contact the decedent\u2019s executor. In addition, their will should be filed with the local county recorder.\n\nProbate is a legal process that determines the validity and authenticity of awill. Probate is also the general administration of a deceased person\u2019s will or the estate of a deceased person without a will. This involves collecting the deceased\u2019s assets to pay any\u00a0liabilities\u00a0that remain on their estate and to distribute the assets to\u00a0beneficiaries.\n\nWhile nobody enjoys thinking about their death, a well-structured estate plan can save your heirs and beneficiaries from a lot of legal unpleasantries. Moreover, it can also ensure that they receive as much money as possible, without losing too much to taxes.\n\nTax Policy Center. \u201cHow Do State Estate and Inheritance Taxes Work?\u201d\n\nTax Foundation. \"Estate and Inheritance Taxes by State, 2024.\"\n\nU.S. General Services Administration. \"How to Find Unclaimed Money from the Government.\"",
