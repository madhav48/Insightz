  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nA leveraged loan index (LLI) is a market-weighted index that tracks the performance of institutional leveraged loans. Several indexes for the market exist, but the most widely followed one is the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index.\n\nAleveraged loanis a senior secured debt obligation that is rated below investment grade (i.e., part of the high-yield or \"junk\" bond market). Leveraged loans are issued to financeleveraged buyouts(LBOs), and most of the loans are traded in the secondary market. The leveraged loan index tracks the prices of the loans.\n\nA leveraged loan is structured, arranged, through a process known as\u00a0syndication.Loan syndicationis the process of bringing together a group of lenders in funding various portions of aloanfor a single borrower, often todiversify the credit risk exposureof any single lender. This version of a leveraged loan index is a common benchmark and represents the 100 largest and most liquid issues of the institutional loan universe.\n\nThe most popular leveraged loan index (LLI) was developed by Standard & Poor\u2019s (S&P) and the Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA). A sub-index assembled by S&P and LSTA is the U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 B/BBRating Index, while S&P has a Global Leveraged Loan 100 Index on its own to include major issuers in Europe. The indexes are rebalanced twice per year. IHS Markit Ltd. and Credit Suisse also maintain proprietary leveraged loan indexes.\n\nAn LLI serves as a benchmark for performance measurement of fund managers dedicated to leveraged loan investment strategies and as a basis for passive investment vehicles such asexchange traded funds(ETF).\n\nFor example, the Invesco Senior Loan Portfolio (ticker: BKLN) is based on the S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 Index. According to Invesco, the asset management company that offers BKLN, the fund invests at least 80% of its total assets in the constituent securities that make up the leveraged loan index, which tracks the market-weighted performance of the component loans based on market weightings, spreads, and interest payments.If less than 100% of the assets are invested in the component securities of the index, there will be variability in the performance of the ETF versus the index.\n\nSome LLIs are tailored to derivatives products that utilize leveraged loans. For instance, theiTraxx LevXare a pair of two tradable indexes that hold credit default swaps (CDSs) representing a diversified basket of the 40 (formerly 35) most liquid European companies that have tradable debt offerings in the secondary market.\n\nThe LevX indices track what are known as leveraged loan credit default swaps (LCDS). The iTraxx LevX Senior Index represents onlyseniorloans, while the iTraxx LevX Subordinated Index representssubordinateddebt including second- and third-lien loans.\n\nS&P Global. \"S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100.\" Accessed Aug. 11, 2021.\n\nInvesco. \"Invesco Senior Loan ETF,\" Page 1.
