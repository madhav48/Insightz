  "term": "Classical Economics: Definition and History",
  "definition": "Classical economics is a broad term that refers to the dominant school of thought foreconomicsin\u00a0the 18th and 19th centuries.\n\nMost consider Scottish economistAdam Smiththe progenitor of classical economic theory. However, Spanish scholastics and French physiocrats made earlier contributions. Other notable contributors to classical economics include David Ricardo,Thomas Malthus, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot,\u00a0John Stuart Mill, Jean-Baptiste Say, and Eugen B\u00f6hm von Bawerk.\n\nSelf-regulating democracies and capitalistic market developments form the basis for classical economics. Before the rise of classical economics, most national economies followed a\u00a0top-down, command-and-control, monarchic government policy system. Many of the most famous classical thinkers, including Smith and Turgot, developed their theories as alternatives to theprotectionistand inflationary policies ofmercantilistEurope.Classical economics became closely associated with economic, and later political, freedom.\n\nClassical economic theory was developed shortly after the birth of westerncapitalismand theIndustrial Revolution. Classical economists provided the best early attempts at explaining capitalism's inner workings. The earliest classical economists developed theories of value, price, supply, demand, and distribution. Nearly all rejected government interference with market exchanges, preferring a looser market strategy known aslaissez-faire.\n\nClassical thinkers were not completely unified in their beliefs or understanding of markets although there were notable common themes in most classical literature. The majority favoredfree tradeand competition among workers and businesses. Classical economists wanted to transition away from class-based social structures in favor of meritocracies.\n\nThe classical economics of Adam Smith had drastically evolved and changed by the 1880s and 1890s, but its core remained intact. By that time, the writings of German philosopherKarl Marxhad emerged to\u00a0challenge the policy\u00a0prescriptions of the classical school. However, Marxian economics made very few lasting contributions to economic theory.\n\nA more thorough challenge to classical theory emerged in the 1930s and 1940s through the writings of British mathematicianJohn Maynard Keynes. Keynes was a student of Alfred Marshall and admirer of Thomas Malthus. Keynes\u00a0thought that free-market economies tended toward underconsumption and underspending. He called this the crucial economic problem and used it to criticize high-interest rates and individual preferences for saving.Keynes also refutedSay's Law of Markets.\n\nKeynesian economicsadvocated for a more controlling role for central governments in economic affairs, which made Keynes popular with British and American politicians. After theGreat Depressionand World War II, Keynesianism had replaced classical and neoclassical economics as the dominant intellectual paradigm among world governments.\n\nAdam Smith\u2019s 1776 release of the \"Wealth of Nations\" highlights some of the most prominent developments in classical economics. His revelations centered around free trade and a concept called the \"invisible hand\" which served as the theory for the beginning stages of domestic and international supply and demand.\n\nThis theory, the dual and competing forces of demand-side and sell-side, moves the market to price and production equilibrium. Smith\u2019s studies helped promote domestic trade and led to more efficient and rational pricing in the product markets based onsupply and demand.\n\nThe centralassumptionof classical economics is that the economy is self-regulating, and that little to no government intervention is needed. If a need were to arise within an economy, classical economists might say, it would be filled by a market participant.\n\nThe best-known classical economist is Adam Smith, an 18th century philosopher and author also known as a the father of modern economics. Smith wrote the influential \"Wealth of Nations\" text.\n\nClassical economics was founded on an assumption that free markets can be self-regulating, and it primarily rejected the idea of significant government interference. Keynesian economics, on the other hand, calls for increasd government involvement, primarily in driving aggregate demand to buoy the economy.\n\nClassical economics refers to the dominant school of economic thought that emerged during the 18th and 19th centuries. It favors free trade, competition, and little to no government interference in markets. Prior to the development of classical economics, many markets were directed in a top-down manner. Thus, classical economics became closely linked with economic and political freedom.\n\nMises Institute. \"A.R.J.
