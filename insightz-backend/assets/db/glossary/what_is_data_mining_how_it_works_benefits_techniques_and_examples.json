  "term": "What Is Data Mining? How It Works, Benefits, Techniques, and Examples",
  "definition": "Data mining is the process of searching and analyzing a large batch of raw data in order to identify patterns and extract useful information.\n\nCompanies use data mining software to learn more about their customers. It can help them to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales, and decrease costs. Data mining relies oneffective data collection,warehousing, and computer processing.\n\nData mining involves exploring and analyzing large blocks of information to glean meaningful patterns and trends. It is used in credit risk management,fraud detection, and spam filtering. It also is a market research tool that helps reveal the sentiment or opinions of a given group of people. The data mining process breaks down into four steps:\n\nData mining programsanalyze relationships and patterns in databased on user requests. It organizes information into classes.\n\nFor example, a restaurant may want to use data mining to determine which specials it should offer and on what days. The data can be organized into classes based onwhen customers visit and what they order.\n\nIn other cases, data miners find clusters of information based on logical relationships\u00a0or look at associations and sequential patterns to draw conclusions about trends in consumer behavior.\n\nWarehousing is an important aspect of data mining. Warehousing is the centralization of an organization's data into one database or program. It allows the organization to spin off segments of data for specific users to analyze and use depending on their needs.\n\nCloud data warehouse solutions use the space and power of a cloud provider to store data. This allows smaller companies to leverage digital solutions for storage, security, and analytics.\n\nData mining uses algorithms and various other techniques to convert large collections of data into useful output. The most popular types of data mining techniques include association rules, classification, clustering, decision trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, neural networks, and predictive analysis.\n\nTo be most effective, data analysts generally follow a certain flow of tasks along the data mining process. Without this structure, an analyst may encounter an issue in the middle of their analysis that could have easily been prevented had they prepared for it earlier. The data mining process is usually broken into the following steps.\n\nBefore any data is touched, extracted, cleaned, or analyzed, it is important to understand the underlying entity and the project at hand. What are the goals the company is trying to achieve by mining data? What is their current business situation? What are the findings of aSWOT analysis? Before looking at any data, the mining process starts by understanding what will define success at the end of the process.\n\nOnce the business problem has been clearly defined, it's time to start thinking about data. This includes what sources are available, how they will be secured and stored, how the information will be gathered, and what the final outcome or analysis may look like. This step also includes determining the limits of the data, storage, security, and collection and assesses how these constraints will affect the data mining process.\n\nData is gathered, uploaded, extracted, or calculated. It is then cleaned, standardized, scrubbed for outliers, assessed for mistakes, and checked for reasonableness. During this stage of data mining, the data may also be checked for size as an oversized collection of information may unnecessarily slow computations and analysis.\n\nWith a clean data set in hand, it's time to crunch the numbers. Data scientists use the types of data mining above to search for relationships, trends, associations, or sequential patterns. The data may also be fed intopredictive modelsto assess how previous bits of information may translate into future outcomes.\n\nThe data-centered aspect of data mining concludes by assessing the findings of the data model or models. The outcomes from the analysis may be aggregated, interpreted, and presented to decision-makers that have largely been excluded from the data mining process to this point. In this step, organizations can choose to make decisions based on the findings.\n\nThe data mining process concludes with management taking steps in response to the findings of the analysis. The company may decide the information was not strong enough or the findings were not relevant, or the company may strategically pivot based on findings. In either case, management reviews the ultimate impacts of the business and recreates future data mining loops by identifying new business problems or opportunities.\n\nDifferent data mining processing models will have different steps, though the general process is usually pretty similar. For example, the Knowledge Discovery Databases model has nine steps, the CRISP-DM model has six steps, and the SEMMA process model has five steps.\n\nIn today's age of information, almost any department, industry,sector, or company can make use of data mining.\n\nData mining encourages smarter, more efficient use of capital to drive revenue growth. Consider thepoint-of-saleregister at your favorite local coffee shop. For every sale, that coffeehouse collects the time a purchase was made and what products were sold. Using this information, the shop can strategically craft its product line.\n\nOnce the coffeehouse knows its ideal line-up, it's time to implement the changes. However, to make its marketing efforts more effective, the store can use data mining to understand where its clients see ads, what demographics to target, where to place digital ads, and what marketing strategies most resonate with customers. This includes aligningmarketing campaigns, promotional offers, cross-sell offers, and programs to the findings of data mining.\n\nFor companies that produce their own goods, data mining plays an integral part in analyzing how much each raw material costs, what materials are being used most efficiently, how time is spent along the manufacturing process, and whatbottlenecksnegatively impact the process. Data mining helps ensure the flow of goods is uninterrupted.\n\nThe heart of data mining is finding patterns, trends, and correlations that link data points together. Therefore, a company can use data mining to identify outliers or correlations that should not exist. For example, a company may analyze itscash flowand find a reoccurring transaction to an unknown account. If this is unexpected, the company may wish to investigate whether funds are being mismanaged.\n\nHuman resourcesdepartments often have a wide range of data available for processing including data on retention, promotions, salary ranges, company benefits, use of those benefits, and employee satisfaction surveys. Data mining can correlate this data to get a better understanding of why employees leave and what entices new hires.\n\nCustomer satisfaction may be caused (or destroyed) by many events or interactions. Imagine a company that ships goods. A customer may be dissatisfied with shipping times, shipping quality, or communications. The same customer may be frustrated with long telephone wait times or slow e-mail responses. Data mining gathers operational information about customer interactions and summarizes the findings to pinpoint weak points and highlight what the company is doing right.\n\nIt drives profitability and efficiency\n\nIt can be applied to any type of data and business problem\n\nIt can reveal hidden information and trends\n\nResults and benefits are not guaranteed\n\nEven large companies or government agencies have challenges with data mining. Consider the FDA's white paper on data mining that outlines the challenges of bad information, duplicate data, underreporting, or overreporting.\n\nOne of the most lucrative applications of data mining has been undertaken by social media companies. Platforms like Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter) gather reams of data about their users based on their online activities.\n\nThat data can be used to make inferences about their preferences. Advertisers can target their messages to the people who appear to be most likely to respond positively.\n\nData mining onsocial mediahas become a big point of contention, with several investigative reports and expos\u00e9s showing just how intrusive mining users' data can be. At the heart of the issue is that users may agree to the terms and conditions of the sites not realizing how their personal information is being collected or to whom their information is being sold.\n\nData mining can be used for good, or it can be used illicitly. Here is an example of both.\n\neBay collects countless bits of information every day from sellers and buyers. The company uses data mining to attribute relationships between products, assess desired price ranges, analyze prior purchase patterns, and form product categories.\n\neBay outlines the recommendation process as:\n\nA cautionary example of data mining is the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal. During the 2010s, the British consulting firm Cambridge Analytica Ltd. collected personal data from millions of Facebook users. This information was later analyzed for use in the 2016 presidential campaigns of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump. It is suspected that Cambridge Analytica interfered with other notable events such as the Brexit referendum.\n\nIn light of this inappropriate data mining and misuse of user data, Facebook agreed to pay $100 million for misleadinginvestorsabout its uses of consumer data. The Securities and Exchange Commission claimed Facebook discovered the misuse in 2015 but did not correct its disclosures for more than two years.\n\nThere are two main types of data mining: predictive data mining and descriptive data mining. Predictive data mining extracts data that may be helpful in determining an outcome. Description data mining informs users of a given outcome.\n\nData mining relies on big data and advanced computing processes including machine learning and other forms of artificial intelligence (AI). The goal is to find patterns that can lead to inferences or predictions from large and unstructured data sets.\n\nData mining also goes by the less-used term \"knowledge discovery in data,\" or KDD.\n\nData mining applications have been designed to take on just about any endeavor that relies on big data. Companies in the financial sector look for patterns in the markets. Governments try to identify potential security threats. Corporations, especially online and social media companies, use data mining to create profitable advertising and marketing campaigns that target specific sets of users.\n\nModern businesses have the ability to gather information on their customers, products, manufacturing lines, employees, and storefronts. These random pieces of information may not tell a story, but the use of data mining techniques, applications, and toolshelps piece together information.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the data mining process is to compile data, analyze the results, and execute operational strategies based on data mining results.\n\nShafique, Umair, and Qaiser, Haseeb. \"A Comparative Study of Data Mining Process Models (KDD, CRISP-DM and SEMMA).\"International Journal of Innovation and Scientific Research. vol. 12, no. 1, November 2014, pp. 217-222.\n\nFood and Drug Administration. \"Data Mining at FDA \u2013 White Paper.\"\n\neBay. \"Building a Deep Learning Based Retrieval System for Personalized Recommendations.\"\n\nFederal Trade Commission. \"FTC Issues Opinion and Order Against Cambridge Analytica for Deceiving Consumers About Collection of Facebook Data, Compliance With EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.\"\n\nU.S. Security and Exchange Commission. \"Facebook to Pay $100 Million for Misleading Investors About the Risks It Faced From Misuse of User Data.\"",
