  "definition": "A firm is an organization that conducts business activities, such as corporations and partnerships, to make profits.\n\nA firm is a for-profit business organization that provides professional services. Firms can be corporations,limited liability companies (LLCs), or partnerships. When used in a title, \"firm\" is typically associated with businesses that provide professional law and accounting services, but the term may be used for a wide variety of\u00a0businesses, including finance, consulting, marketing, and graphic design firms, among others.\n\nIn microeconomics, thetheory of the firmattempts to explain why firms exist, why they operate and produce as they do, and how they are structured. The theory of the firm asserts that firms exist to maximize profits.\n\nThis theory, though, changes as the economic marketplace changes. More modern theories would distinguish\u00a0between firms that work toward long-termsustainabilityand those that aim to produce high levels of profit in a short time.\n\nAlthough they appear synonymous and are often used interchangeably, there is a difference between a firm and a company. A company can be any trade or business in which goods or services are sold to produce income. It also encompasses all business structures like asole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation.\n\nOn the other hand, a firm typically excludes the sole proprietorship business. It generally refers to a for-profit business managed by two or more partners providing professional services, such as a law firm. In some cases, a firm can be a corporation.\n\nMost firms have just one location. However, a business firm consists of one or more physical establishments, which fall under the same ownership and\u00a0use the sameemployer identification number (EIN).\n\nA firm's business activities are typically conducted under the firm's name, but the degree of legal protection for employees or owners depends on the type of ownership structure under which the firm was created.\n\nSome organization types, such as corporations, provide more legal protection than others. There exists the concept of themature firmthat has been firmly established. Firms can assume many different types based on their ownership structures:\n\nMost firms will not operate as a sole proprietorship as this means the individual is personally liable for faults of the firm.\n\nThe objective of a firm to is convert inputs into outputs. For this reason, firms use a variety of resources to generate products, services, and offerings to clients. These resources may include but aren't limited to:\n\nThe activities of a firm can often be broken down into three categories: business operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities. These three categories are listed on a firm's statement of cash flow and are discussed further below.\n\nThe primary activity of a company (and the primary section on astatement of cash flow) is the operating activities section. This section ties to the actual core business of the company. These activities include selling products or incurring business expenses. Most of these activities are related to theincome statement, as these activities most often relate to a company's day-to-day operations and income.\n\nIn some cases, the operating activities section of a statement of cash flow is negative. If the amount is negative, that means the company is using/spending more cash than it is bringing in specific to business operations. This also means the company must rely on the other two sections to ensure enough cash flow is coming into the company to maintain operations.\n\nInvesting activitiesare the long-term cashflow activities a company incurs to plan for the future and ensure it has the infrastructure to scale operations. Examples of investing activities include acquiring equipment, constructing office buildings, or buying heavy equipment.\n\nAlthough these activities may not be required for day-to-day operations, investing activities play an integral part in a firm's long-term success. Consider a firm that makes its own goods. By investing in a corporate warehouse and robust manufacturing plant, the firm is more likely to achieve business operation success.\n\nThe last section of activities of a firm are thefinancing activities. Although these are also not usually part of the day-to-day operations of a firm, the financing activities play an important in ensuring the long-term financial health of a firm.\n\nSome financing activities are cash inflows, while other are cash outflows. For example, firms may decide to award dividends to investors funded from net income of the firm. Alternatively, firms may borrow money from lenders or issue equity to investors to raise capital to support the day-to-day operations.\n\nThe word firm has Latin roots to the word signature, which indicates that it may have historically been used to describe the name of a company. In addition, the etymology of the word translates back to \"a business\" or \"a name of a business\".\n\nA firm may take a variety of legal structures, including sole proprietorships, partnerships, corporations, or cooperatives. The rules dictating the operations and organizational structure of the company are often heavily dictated by the legal type of the firm.\n\nThough an oversimplification, the purpose of a firm is to make money. A nonprofit is often not referred to as a firm; therefore, a firm's purpose is to facilitate trade between a manufacturer or retailer with a client. A firm's purpose is to ensure a good or service is transmit to those who need it with the expectation that the firm can generate a profit along the way.\n\nA firm often refers to a company that sells a service to customers, though sometimes a physical good may be transmitted as well. The ultimate goal of a firm is to make money, as a firm is often not a non-profit. The activities of a firm can usually be broken into the operating, investing, and financing aspects of the firm.\n\nU.S. Small Business Administration. \"Choose a Business Structure.\"\n\nHart, Oliver. \"Thinking about the Firm: A Review of Daniel Spulber\u2019s The Theory of the Firm.\"Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 49, no. 1, March 2011, pp. 109.\n\nOnline Etymology Dictionary. \"Firm.\"",
