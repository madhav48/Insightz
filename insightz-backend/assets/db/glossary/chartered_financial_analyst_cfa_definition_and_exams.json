  "definition": "It takes an average of four years for an individual to earn the designation of chartered financial analyst (CFA).\n\nThe chartered financial analyst (CFA) charter is a professional designation offered by theCFA Institute, an organization that measures and certifies the competence and integrity of financial analysts. Candidates must pass three levels of exams covering accounting, economics, ethics, money management, and security analysis.\n\nFrom 1963 through February 2025, more than 3.9 million candidates had taken the CFA exam. The overall pass rate was 45%. From 2016 through 2025, the 10-year average pass rate was 45%.\n\nThe CFA charter is one of the most respected designations in finance and is widely considered to be the gold standard in the field of investment analysis.\n\nThe designation is handed out by the CFA Institute, which is a global nonprofit professional organization of more than 200,000 charterholders,portfolio managers, and other financial professionals in 164 countries and 160 local member societies.\n\nThe CFA's meaning concerns the stated mission of the CFA Institute, which is to develop and promote a high level of educational, ethical, and professional standards in the investment industry.\n\nBefore becoming a CFA charter holder, a candidate must meet one of the following educational requirements:\n\nAfter meeting the enrollment requirements, the candidate must pass all three levels of the CFA program in sequential order.Professional reference letters are also required. The candidate must then become a member of the CFA Institute and pay annual dues.\n\nFinally, they must sign off annually that they are following the CFA Institutecode of ethicsand standards of professional conduct. Failure to adhere to the code of ethics and standards is grounds for the possible lifetime revocation of the CFA charter.\n\nPassing the\u00a0CFA\u00a0Program exams requires strong discipline and an extensive amount of studying. The Level I exam can be taken four times a year in February, May, August, and November. The Level II exam can be taken three times a year in May, August, and November. The Level III exam can be taken two times a year in February and August.\n\nAlthough the exams can be taken as many times as needed, each exam typically requires candidates to study over 300 hours.Given the considerable amount\u00a0of time that must be spent studying, many candidates are deterred from continuing the CFA Program after failing one of the levels.\n\nThe exams are difficult. Only 45% of candidates passed the exams between 1963 and 2025. Having the right plan and the discipline to follow the plan are essential skills for passing all three exams. Notably, 2019 saw the most test takers of any year. But numbers have not rebounded from the sharp decline seen during the pandemic.\n\nThe CFA Institute has over 400 test centers worldwide. It has been adding testing locations in Asia due to increased demand in that region.\n\nThe pass rate for the exam is below 50% in recent decades, making the CFA charter one of the most difficult financial certifications to obtain.A minimum of 300 hours of study is recommended for each exam.\n\nThe CFA Level I examination focuses on financial analysis using the tools of the 10 topic areas of the candidate'sbody of knowledge.\n\nThese areas are ethical and professional standards, quantitative methods, economics, financial statement and analysis, corporate finance, equity investments, fixed income,derivatives, alternative investments, and portfolio management.\u00a0The exam format is 180 multiple-choice questions to be completed within four and a half hours.\n\nThe Level II exam focuses on the valuation of various assets and emphasizes the application of investment tools and concepts in contextual situations.\n\nExam questions referring to Financial Reporting and Analysis are typically based onInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The exam has 22 item sets (mini case studies) with 88 multiple-choice questions (110 questions total).\n\nThe Level 3 exam focuses on effective wealth planning and portfolio management. It requires the candidate to synthesize all the concepts and analytical methods learned from the entire curriculum.\n\nThe exam format is multi-part with 11 item sets and 11 essay questions to be completed within four hours and 24 minutes. The handwritten answers are graded by hand.\n\nFor the 10 years of 2016 through 2025:\n\nThe CFA charter is widely respected, globally recognized, and a worthwhile undertaking to accomplish. However, it is not a guaranteed path to riches and glory. So, before taking the plunge, carefully consider how difficult it can be to earn one.\n\n1. The CFA is not a quick fix for an ailing career. If that's why you're enrolling in the program, you should carefully consider the work involved in the CFA path ahead of you. You might instead choose to improve yoursoft skills, such as your work ethic and communication capability.\n\n2. The CFA requires a huge investment of time\u2014a recommended minimum of 300 hours of studying per exam for three exams.If you don't pass an exam the first time, you'll have to reapply your efforts. You will likely sacrifice time with family, friends, and the hobbies that you enjoy. And after committing all that time, there is no guarantee that you will earn the charter.\n\n3. While cost may not be a major consideration, it is worth careful deliberation. A Level I candidate pays a one-time program enrollment fee plus an exam registration fee. Level II and III candidates pay a registration fee as well. There is also the cost of the books and study programs you'll need. Altogether, you should expect to spend several thousand dollars each time\u00a0you attempt the exams.\n\nThe CFA exams are difficult and have a high failure rate. Each exam requires at least 300 hours of study, on average.Successful candidates take an average of four years to earn the designation.\n\nEach of the three levels of the CFA exam costs $1,250 (which is reduced to $940 if you register early). In addition, there is a one-time enrollment fee of $350.With early enrollment, you would end up paying a total of $3,170. With regular enrollment, the total cost is $4,100.\n\nThe CFA Level I exam is entirely multiple-choice, with 180 questions.The Level II exam consists of 22 item sets and 88 multiple-choice questions.Level III consists of 11 constructed response (essay) questions and 11 item sets.Constructed response items typically have several parts related to a case study that describes one or a series of investment challenges.\n\nIndustry reports indicate that CFA charter holders are paid more than those who have not completed the program. According to test prep provider 300 Hours, a CFA charter holder earns, on average, 57% more than a Level I candidate when controlling for years of work experience.\n\nThe financial designation of CFA is respected worldwide. It can be a highly valuable achievement for those willing and able to devote the time, effort, and money to meeting its requirements, which include studying for and passing three difficult exams.\n\nCFA Institute. \"1963-2025 Candidate Examination Results.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"Annual Report Fiscal Year 2024.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"How to Become a CFA Charterholder.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"CFA Program Exam Schedule.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"Exam Information, Dates and Fees.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"CFA Program Test Center Locations.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"Level I CFA Exam Structure.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"CFA Level II Questions & Exam Format.\"\n\nCFA Institute. \"Level III CFA Exam Structure.\"\n\n300 Hours. \"CFA Salary: How Much Does a CFA Charter Increase Your Pay By?\"",
