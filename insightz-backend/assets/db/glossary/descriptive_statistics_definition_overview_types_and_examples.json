  "definition": "Descriptive statistics are\u00a0techniques that summarize a dataset\u2019s main features.\u00a0The data, which represents an entire population or a sample, is presented concisely in a way that doesn\u2019t draw conclusions beyond the data.\n\nDescriptive statistics are brief informational coefficients that summarize a given dataset, which can be either a representation of the entirepopulationor asampleof a population. Descriptive statistics are broken down into measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central tendency include themean,median, andmode, while measures of variability includestandard deviation,variance, minimum and maximum variables,kurtosis, andskewness.\n\nDescriptive statistics help describe and explain the features of a specific dataset\u00a0by giving short summaries about the sample and measures of the data. The most recognized types of descriptive statistics are measures of center. For example, the mean, median, and mode, which are used at almost all levels of math and statistics, are used to define and describe a dataset. The mean, or the average, is calculated by adding all the figures within the dataset and then dividing by the number of figures within the set.\n\nFor example, the sum of the following dataset is 20: (2, 3, 4, 5, 6). The mean is 4 (20/5). The mode of a dataset is the value appearing most often, and the median is the value situated in the middle of the dataset. It is the figure separating the higher figures from the lower figures within a dataset. However, there are less common types of descriptive statistics that are still very important.\n\nPeople use descriptive statistics to repurpose hard-to-understand quantitative insights across a large dataset into bite-sized descriptions. A student\u2019s grade-point average (GPA), for example, provides a good understanding of descriptive statistics. The idea of a GPA is that it takes data points from a range of individual course grades and averages them together to provide a general understanding of a student\u2019s overall academic performance. A student\u2019s personal GPA reflects their mean academic performance.\n\nDescriptive statistics, especially in fields such as medicine, often visually depict data using scatter plots, histograms, line graphs, or stem and leaf displays.We\u2019ll talk more about visuals later in this article.\n\nAll descriptive statistics are either measures of central tendency or measures ofvariability, also known as measures of dispersion.\n\nMeasures of central tendency focus on the average or middle values of datasets, whereas measures of variability focus on the dispersion of data. These two measures use graphs, tables, and general discussions to help people understand the meaning of the analyzed data.\n\nMeasures of central tendency describe the center position of a distribution for a dataset. A person analyzes the frequency of each data point in the distribution and describes it using the mean, median, or mode, which measures the most common patterns of the analyzed dataset.\n\nMeasures of variability (or measures of spread) aid in analyzing how dispersed the distribution is for a dataset. For example, while the measures of central tendency may give a person the average of a dataset, it does not describe how the data is distributed within the set.\n\nSo, while the average of the data might be 65 out of 100, there can still be data points at both 1 and 100. Measures of variability help communicate this by describing the shape and spread of the dataset. Range,quartiles, absolute deviation, and variance are all examples of measures of variability.\n\nConsider the following dataset: 5, 19, 24, 62, 91, 100. The range of that dataset is 95, which is calculated by subtracting the lowest number (5) in the dataset from the highest (100).\n\nDistribution (or frequency distribution) refers to the number of times a data point occurs. Alternatively, it can be how many times a data point fails to occur. Consider this dataset: male, male, female, female, female, other. The distribution of this data can be classified as:\n\nIn descriptive statistics, univariate data analyzes only one variable. It is used to identify characteristics of a single trait and is not used to analyze any relationships or causations.\n\nFor example, imagine a room full of high school students. Say you wanted to gather the average age of the individuals in the room. This univariate data is only dependent on one factor: each person\u2019s age. By gathering this one piece of information from each person and dividing by the total number of people, you can determine the average age.\n\nBivariate data, on the other hand, attempts to link two variables by searching for correlation. Two types of data are collected, and the relationship between the two pieces of information is analyzed together.Because multiple variables are analyzed, this approach may also be referred to asmultivariate.\n\nLet\u2019s say each high school student in the example above takes a college assessment test, and we want to see whether older students are testing better than younger students. In addition to gathering the ages of the students, we need to find out each student\u2019s test score. Then, using data analytics, we mathematically or graphically depict whether there is a relationship between student age and test scores.\n\nPreparing and reporting financial statements are an example of descriptive statistics. Analyzing that financial information to make decisions on the future is inferential statistics.\n\nOne essential aspect of descriptive statistics is graphical representation. Visualizing data distributions effectively can be incredibly powerful, and this is done in several ways.\n\nHistogramsare tools for displaying the distribution of numerical data. They divide the data into bins or intervals and represent the frequency or count of data points falling into each bin through bars of varying heights. Histograms help identify the shape of the distribution, central tendency, and variability of the data.\n\nAnother visualization is boxplots. Boxplots, also known as box-and-whisker plots, provide a concise summary of a data distribution by highlighting key summary statistics, including the median (middle line inside the box), quartiles (edges of the box), and potential outliers (points outside, or the \u201cwhiskers\u201d). Boxplots visually depict the spread and skewness of the data and are particularly useful for comparing distributions across different groups or variables.\n\nWhenever descriptive statistics are being discussed, it\u2019s important to note outliers. Outliers are data points that significantly differ from other observations in a dataset. These could be errors, anomalies, or rare events within the data.\n\nDetecting and managing outliers is a step in descriptive statistics to ensure accurate and reliable data analysis. To identify outliers, you can use graphical techniques (such as boxplots or scatter plots) or statistical methods (such asZ-scoreor IQR method). These approaches help pinpoint observations that deviate substantially from the overall pattern of the data.\n\nThe presence of outliers can have a notable impact on descriptive statistics, skewing results and affecting the interpretation of data. Outliers can disproportionately influence measures of central tendency, such as the mean, pulling it toward their extreme values. For example, the dataset of (1, 1, 1, 997) is 250, even though that is hardly representative of the dataset. This distortion can lead to misleading conclusions about the typical behavior of the dataset.\n\nDepending on the context, outliers can often be treated by removing them (if they are genuinely erroneous or irrelevant). Alternatively, outliers may hold important information and should be kept for the value they may be able to demonstrate. As you analyze your data, consider the relevance of what outliers can contribute and whether it makes more sense to just strike those data points from your descriptive statistic calculations.\n\nDescriptive statistics have a different function from inferential statistics, which are datasets that are used to make decisions or apply characteristics from one dataset to another.\n\nImagine another example where a company sells hot sauce. The company gathers data such as the count ofsales, average quantity purchased pertransaction, and average sale per day of the week. All of this information is descriptive, as it tells a story of what actually happened in the past. In this case, it is not being used beyond being informational.\n\nNow let\u2019s say that the company wants to roll out a new hot sauce. It gathers the same sales data above, but it uses the information to make predictions about what the sales of the new hot sauce will be. The act of using descriptive statistics and applying characteristics to a different dataset makes the dataset inferential statistics. We are no longer simply summarizing data; we are using it to predict what will happen regarding an entirely different body of data (in this case, the new hot sauce product).\n\nImagine you have a large number of something and want to tell your friends about them, but there are so many of them. Descriptive statistics give your friends a quick summary, so they know what you have without looking at every single item.\n\nDescriptive statistics are about using numbers and often easy pictures, like charts, to tell a story about something being examined. They help you understand what is in the collection of something and explain it to others quickly.\n\nDescriptive statistics are a means of describing features of a dataset by generating summaries about data samples. For example, a population census may include descriptive statistics regarding the ratio of men and women in a specific city.\n\nIn recapping a Major League Baseball season, for example, descriptive statistics might include team batting averages, the number of runs allowed per team, and the average wins per division.\n\nThe main purpose of descriptive statistics is to provide information about a dataset. In the example above, there are dozens of baseball teams, hundreds of players, and thousands of games. Descriptive statistics summarizes large amounts of data into useful bits of information.\n\nThe three main types of descriptive statistics are frequency distribution, central tendency, and variability of a dataset. Frequency distribution records how often data occurs, central tendency records the data\u2019s center point of distribution, and variability of a dataset records its degree of dispersion.\n\nTechnically speaking, descriptive statistics only serve to help understand historical data attributes. Inferential statistics, a separate branch of statistics, are used to understand how variables interact with one another in a dataset and possibly predict what might happen in the future.\n\nDescriptive statistics refer to the analysis, summary, and communication of findings that describe a dataset. Often not useful for decision making, descriptive statistics still hold value in explaining high-level summaries of a set of information such as the mean, median, mode, variance, range, and count of information.\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab, Purdue University. \u201cDescriptive Statistics.\u201d\n\nNational Center for Biotechnology Information. \u201cDescriptive Statistics For Summarizing Data.\u201d\n\nCalifornia State University Northridge. \u201cMeasures Of Variability, Descriptive Statistics Part 2.\u201d\n\nKent State University, Department of Mathematical Sciences. \u201cSummary: Differences Between Univariate and Bivariate Data.\u201d\n\nPurdue Online Writing Lab, Purdue University. \u201cBasic Inferential Statistics: Theory and Application.\u201d",
