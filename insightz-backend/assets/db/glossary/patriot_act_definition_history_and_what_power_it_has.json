  "definition": "The Patriot Act, or USA PATRIOT Act, was passed shortly after the terrorist attacks in the United States that occurred onSeptember 11, 2001, and gave law enforcement agencies broader powers to investigate,\u00a0indict, and bring terrorists to justice. It also led to increased penalties for committing and supporting terrorist crimes.\n\nAn acronym for \u201cUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism,\u201d the USA PATRIOT Act lowered the threshold for law enforcement to obtain intelligence and information against suspected spies,terrorists, and other enemies of the United States.\n\nThe Patriot Act, the common reference for the USA PATRIOT Act, was passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 26, 2001, following the September 11th terrorist attacks against the United States.\n\nIt enhanced previous legislation from April 1996, entitled the \u201cAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\u201d enacted during the Clinton administration following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.\n\nThe Patriot Act aimed to increase homeland security and expand tools available to law enforcement and federal agents such as:\n\n\u2022 Surveillance, wiretapping, and roving wiretaps to track and investigate terror-related crimes.\n\n\u2022 Obtaining bank records and business financial records to preventmoney launderingfor terrorism financing.\n\n\u2022 Improved intelligence sharing between government agencies.\n\n\u2022 Tougher penalties for convicted terrorists and those who aid them.\n\n\u2022 Allowing for delayed search warrants.\n\n\u2022 Preventing aliens involved in terrorist activities to enter the United States.\n\nPolice officers, FBI agents, federal prosecutors, and intelligence officials are better able to share information and evidence on individuals and plots, thus enhancing their protection of communities.\n\nFederal agents may use court orders to obtain business records from hardware stores or chemical plants to determine who may be buying materials to construct bombs. Bank records can be obtained to determine if an individual or entity is sending money to terrorists or suspect organizations.\n\nThe Patriot Act widened the use of National Security Letters issued by the FBI which are issued without a judge's approval to obtain phone records, bank records, or computer records.\n\nThe Patriot Act impacts financial professionals andfinancial institutionswith its Title III provision, entitled \"International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001,\u201d targeting parties suspected of terrorism, terrorist financing, and money laundering.\n\nBanks must alsoinvestigate accountsowned by political figures suspected of past corruption and there are greater restrictions on the use of internal bank concentration accounts that fail to effectively maintainaudit trails.\n\nTheBank Secrecy Act of 1970(BSA), The Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, requires banks to record cash purchases of instruments that have daily aggregate values of $10,000 or more, an amount that triggers suspicion oftax evasionand other questionable practices and the Patriot Act makes concealing more than $10,000 on anyone\u2019s physical person an offense punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nThe Act expanded the definition of money laundering to include computer crimes, thebribingof elected officials, and the fraudulent handling of public funds. Money laundering now encompasses the exportation or importation of controlled munitions not approved by the U.S. Attorney General.\n\nThe Patriot Act and its merit have been debated since its inception in 2001 and advocates claim the Act has made anti-terrorism efforts more streamlined, efficient, and effective.\n\nAccording to the Department of Justice, the Patriot Act has incapacitated at least 3,000 operatives worldwide, broken terrorist cells in Buffalo, Detroit, Seattle, Portland, and Northern Virginia, designated 40 terrorist organizations, and frozen at least $136 million in suspected assets around the world.\n\nRoving wiretaps allow tracking of international terrorists trained to avoid surveillance. The option to delay notifying terrorist suspects of a search warrant gives law enforcement time to identify the criminal\u2019s associates and eliminate immediate community threats.\n\nThe Patriot Act facilitates information sharing and cooperation among government agencies so that they can better \"connect the dots.\" With more unity through multiple communication channels, investigating officers can act quickly before a suspected attack is completed.\n\nIncreased wiretapping under the Patriot Act lets investigators listen to conversations that could potentially be threatening to the national security of a country, but groups like the American Civil Liberties Union have questioned the risk of abuse of wiretapping American citizens.\n\nCivil rights groups have claimed the Patriot Act violates Constitutional rights and allows the government to spy on individuals without due process and search their homes without consent.\n\nThe Act enhanced the use of national security letters, NSLs, an administrative subpoena issued by the United States government to gather information, like telephone records, or bank records, for national security purposes. However, the Patriot Act does not require information obtained by an NSL to be destroyed, even for an innocent citizen.\n\nCritics argue that basic rights under the Fourth Amendment have been compromised by the Patriot Act as delayed warrants allow officials to enter homes or offices and conduct searches while the occupant is away.\n\nThe business, finance, and investment communities are affected by heightened documentation requirements anddue diligenceresponsibilities for account holders who conduct international business.\n\nSuspected terrorists have been imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and other sites with delayed due process. In addition, following 9/11, many Muslims, South Asians, and Arabs, and their communities, were unfairly targeted and racially profiled due to the passage of the Patriot Act.\n\nTo help prevent the Patriot Act from infringing on the civil liberties of American citizens, President Barack Obama signed the USA Freedom Act into law on June 2, 2015, ending the bulk collection of phone records under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. It also required transparency between the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and the American people but allows the government to track suspected foreign terrorists for 72 hours after they enter the United States.\n\nThe Patriot Act allows federal law enforcement to delay giving notice and conduct secret searches of homes or offices as deemed necessary while the occupant of a home or business is away.\n\nMany of the Patriot Act\u2019s requirements were set to expire in 2005 and despite continued civil liberties and privacy concerns, President George W. Bush signed the USA Patriot and Terrorism Reauthorization Act on March 9, 2006, continuing the use of the provisions already in place.\n\nThe USA PATRIOT Act, commonly known as the Patriot Act, was signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 26, 2001, following the September 11 terrorist attacks. It enhanced the abilities of law enforcement regarding surveillance, money laundering for terrorism financing, and improved intelligence sharing between government agencies.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice. \"Highlights of the USA PATRIOT Act: The USA PATRIOT Act: Preserving Life and Liberty.\"\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union. \"Surveillance Under the Patriot Act.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"H.R.3162 - Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001.\"\n\nU.S. Congress. \"S.735 - Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996.\"\n\nU.S. Department of Justice, Office of the Inspector General. \"Statement of Glenn A.
