  "definition": "Gordon Scott has been an active investor and technical analyst or 20+ years. He is a Chartered Market Technician (CMT).\n\nThe Over-The-Counter Exchange of India (OTCEI) is an electronic stock exchange based in India that consists of small- and medium-sized firms aiming to gain access to overseascapital markets,\u00a0including electronic exchanges in the U.S. such as theNASDAQ. There is no central place of exchange, and all trading occurs through electronic networks.\n\nThe OTCEI is based in Mumbai, India, and operates solely over a computer network. The exchange is recognized by India's Securities Contract Regulation Act, meaning alllistedstocks on the OTCEI benefit equally as other listedsecuritieson other exchanges in India.\n\nThe exchange was established in 1990 to provide investors and companies with an additional way to trade and issue securities. It arose primarily from small companies in India finding it difficult to raisecapitalthrough mainstream national stockexchangesbecause they could not fulfill the stringent requirements to be listed on them.\n\nThe OTCEI has rules that are not as rigid as the national exchanges, allowing small companies to gain access to the capital they need to grow. The objective is that once they grow to a certain level and are able to meet the requirements to be listed on the nationalstock exchanges, they will make the switch over and leave the OTCEI behind.\n\nThanks to advances in technology that have yielded improvements in electronic trading platforms, the differences between traditional exchanges andover-the-counter(OTC) networks are no longer vast, greatly benefiting the small- and medium-sized companies.\n\nThe OTCEI has some special features that make it a unique exchange in India as well as a growth catalyst for small- to medium-sized companies. The following are some of its unique features:\n\nThe OTCEI makes it easier for small- to mid-cap sized companies to be listed, although there are still some requirements that companies must meet before being allowed to be listed.\n\nStipulations include acquiring sponsorship from members of the OTCEI and having twomarket makers. In addition, once a company is listed, it cannot bedelistedfor at least three years, and a certain percentage of issued equity capital needs to be kept by promoters for a minimum of three years. This percentage is 20%.\n\nThe transactions on the OTCEI revolve around the dealers. Dealers operate in a few capacities, the two most important being as abrokerand as a market maker. As a broker, the dealer transacts on behalf of buyers and sellers. As a market maker, the dealer has to ensure the availability of the shares for transaction purposes as well as to ensure that the price remains reasonable throughsupply and demandlevels.\n\nIn addition to the dealers, the OTCEI also has custodians. Thecustodian, or settler, is the individual that performs the multitude of administrative tasks necessary for the proper functioning of the OTCEI. These tasks include validating and storing documents as well as facilitating dailyclearingtransactions.\n\nFinally, the last group of players consists of theregistrarsandtransfer agents, who are responsible for making sure the correct transfer and allotment of shares take place.",
