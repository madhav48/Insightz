  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nTax free refers to certain types of goods and financial securities (such as municipal bonds) that are not taxed. It also refers toearnings that are not taxed. The tax free status of these goods, investments, and income may incentivize individuals and business entities to increase spending or investing, resulting in economic stimulus. Tax free may also be known as tax-exempt.\n\nTax free purchases and investments do not incur the typical tax consequence of other purchases and investments. For instance, tax free weekends occur in many states where, once or twice a year, store purchases are not taxed, thereby, reducing the overall cost to the consumer. Frequently these salestax holidaysoccur before school starts in the Fall to incentivize spending on school supplies, clothes, computers, calculators, etc.\n\nGovernments will often provide atax breakto investors purchasinggovernment bondsto ensure that enough funding will be available for expenditure projects. Tax free investments such as tax-exemptmunicipal bonds(or munis) allow investors to earn interest income tax free.Interest may only be tax free at the federal level if, for example, a California resident buys a New York municipal bond. These tax laws, however, vary by state. For instance, some states such as Wisconsin and Illinois tax interest earned on all muni bonds, including their own, subject to a few exceptions.Meanwhile, states such as California and Arizona exempt interest from taxes only if the investor resides in the issuing state.\n\nFor example, assume a local government in California issues a municipal bond to finance a recreational park. An investor, John Smith, who resides in the state of issuance purchases the $5,000par value bondwhich matures in two years and has acoupon rateof 3% to be paid annually. At the end of each of the two years, the investor receives interest income of 3% x $5,000 = $150. This income will not be taxed by both the federal and state government. After the bond matures, John Smith will receive his original principal investment back from the local government.\n\nAlaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming don't have a state-level income tax, so they naturally exempt interest on all muni bonds.Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government,\u00a0namely theU.S. Savings BondandTreasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPSs), pay interest that is tax free at the state and local levels, but not the federal level.\n\nAccording to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), interest on a state or local government obligation may be tax free even if the obligation is not a bond.For example, interest on a debt evidenced only by an ordinary written agreement of purchase and sale may be tax free. Also, interest paid by an insurer on default by the state or political subdivision may be exempted from tax.Mutual fundsthat hold a mix of stocks and municipal bonds will have the portion of earnings derived from the bonds tax-exempt under federal income tax guidelines and possibly free from state taxes depending on the location from which the bonds originated and/or the taxpayer's state of residence.\n\nSince tax free interest is not subject to income taxes, it is not included in the calculation ofadjusted gross income (AGI)for taxation purposes. Issuers or lenders that pay more than $10 in tax free interest must report the interest income to both taxpayers and the IRS on Form 1099-INT.Taxpayers or borrowers, in turn, must report this tax-exempt interest onForm 1040.The amount received as tax-exempt interest is used by the IRS to determine what amount of the taxpayer's Social Security benefits are taxable.\n\nFives states in the U.S. have tax-free shopping: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. That said, several local municipalities in Alaska do charge sales tax.\n\nThe higher an investor\u2019smarginal tax bracket, the more valuable and beneficial tax free securities are for the investor. A tax free investment will carry atax-equivalent yieldthat is often higher than the current yield, as determined by the investor's tax bracket. The tax-equivalent yield is the taxable interest rate that would be required to provide the same after-tax interest rate. The tax equivalent yield of a tax-exempt bond can be calculated as:\n\nFor example, if John Smith in the example above falls in the 35% tax bracket, the 3% muni yield is equivalent to ataxable bondwith a yield of:\n\nWhat if John Smith was in the 22% tax bracket? The tax-equivalent yield will be:\n\nThe higher your tax rate, the higher the tax-equivalent yield\u2014this shows how tax free securities are best suited to those in higher tax brackets.\n\nGifts such as cash given to a family member are typically tax-free but may need to be reported. In 2025, you can gift up to $19,000 without reporting it to the IRS. Gifts over $13.99 million (over a lifetime) are subject to a gift tax.\n\nThe tax-free status is most valuable when you have to pay a high tax. The higher your marginal tax bracket\u2014or the more expensive a good or service\u2014the more value you receive from tax freedom.\n\nTax free and duty free shopping are different categories that allow you to save money while traveling. With tax free shopping, travelers pay the tax on goods upfront and apply for a refund after they leave the destination where the tax is due. In contrast, tax discounts are applied immediately for duty free shopping.\n\nTax free purchases, investments, and earnings do not incur taxes like normal goods and transactions. Governments grant items tax free status to facilitate spending and grant benefits to specific groups like the disabled or veterans. Investors gain more benefit from tax free investments the higher their marginal tax bracket, making these securities especially effective for high-income earners.\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"Municipal Bonds.\"\n\nIllinois Department of Revenue. \"Pub-101, Income Exempt from Tax.\"\n\nState of Wisconsin Department of Revenue. \"Individual Income Tax and Municipal Bond Interest.\"\n\nArizona Department of Revenue. \"Identifying Other Taxable Income.\"\n\nTax Foundation. \"State Individual Income Tax Rates and Brackets, 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses,\" Page 5.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 550, Investment Income and Expenses,\" Page 11.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Instructions for Forms 1099-INT and 1099-OID,\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Form 1040: U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Income \u2013 Wages, Interest, Etc.,\" Page 8.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Release Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\"",
