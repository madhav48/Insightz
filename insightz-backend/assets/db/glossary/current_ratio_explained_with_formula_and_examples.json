  "definition": "The current ratio compares current assets to current liabilities to determine how well a company can meet all financial obligations due within a year.\n\nThe current ratio is a commonliquidity ratioused to judge whether or not a company can pay current obligations.\n\nIt tells investors and analysts if a company can maximize thecurrent assetson its balance sheet to meet its current debt payments and other payables due within a year.\n\nA current ratio that is in line with the industry average or slightly higher is generally considered acceptable.\n\nA current ratio that is lower than the industry average may indicate a higher risk of financial distress or default by the company.\n\nIf a company has a very high current ratio compared with its peer group, it indicates that management may not be using its assets efficiently.\n\nThe current ratio is called current because, unlike some other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all current assets and current liabilities. It is sometimes called theworking capitalratio.\n\nInvestors, analysts, and companies need to know whether a business can pay what it owes.\n\nThe current ratio\u00a0provides a measure of this capability by weighing current (short-term) liabilities (debts and payables) against current assets (cash, inventory, and receivables).\n\nIn many cases, a company with a current ratio of less than 1.00 would not have the capital on hand to meet its short-term financial obligations should they all come due at once.\n\nA current ratio greater than 1.00 indicates that the company has the financial resources to remain solvent in the short term.\n\nThis is useful information. However, because the current ratio is a snapshot of a particular moment in time, it is usually not considered a complete representation of a company\u2019s short-termliquidityor longer-termsolvency.\n\nFor example, a company may have a very high current ratio, but itsaccounts receivable may be very aged, perhaps because its customers pay slowly, which may be hidden in the current ratio. Some of the accounts receivable may even need to be written off.\n\nAnalysts also must consider the quality of a company\u2019s other assets vs. its obligations. If theinventory is unable to be sold, the current ratio may look acceptable even though the company may be headed for default.\n\nIn general, the higher the current ratio, the more capable a company is of paying its obligations. It has a larger proportion of short-term asset value relative to the value of its short-term liabilities.\n\nNote though that a high ratio\u2014say, more than 3.00\u2014could indicate that although the company can cover its current liabilities three times, it may not be using its current assets efficiently, securing financing very well, orproperly managing its working capital.\n\nThis is why it is helpful to compare a company's current ratio to those of similarly-sized businesses within the same industry.\n\nPublic companies don't report their current ratio, though all the information needed to calculate the it is contained in the company's financial statements.\n\nTo calculate the ratio, compare current assets to current liabilities.\n\nCurrent\u00a0Ratio=Current\u00a0assetsCurrent\u00a0liabilities\\begin{aligned} &\\text{Current Ratio}=\\frac{\\text{Current assets}}{ \\text{Current liabilities}} \\end{aligned}\u200bCurrent\u00a0Ratio=Current\u00a0liabilitiesCurrent\u00a0assets\u200b\u200b\n\nCurrent assets listed on a company\u2019s balance sheet include cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and other current assets (OCA) that are expected to be liquidated or turned into cash in less than one year.\n\nCurrent liabilities include accounts payable, wages, taxes payable, short-term debts, and the current portion of long-term debt.\n\nA current ratio of less than 1.00 may seem alarming, but a single ratio doesn't always offer a complete picture of a company's finances.\n\nFor example, a normal cycle for the company\u2019s collections and payment processes may lead to a high current ratio as payments are received, but a low current ratio as those collections ebb.\n\nCalculating the current ratio at one point in time could indicate that the company can\u2019t cover all of its current debts, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it won\u2019t be able to when the payments are due.\n\nAs another example, large retailers often negotiate much longer-than-average payment terms with their suppliers. If a retailer doesn\u2019t offer credit to its customers, this can show on its balance sheet as a high payables balance relative to its receivables balance.\n\nLarge retailers can also minimize their inventory volume through an efficientsupply chain, which makes their current assets shrink against current liabilities, resulting in a lower current ratio.\n\nThe current ratio can be a useful measure of a company\u2019s short-term solvency when it is placed in the context of what has been historically normal for the company and its peer group.\n\nIt also offers more insight when calculated regularly over several periods. That is, changes in the current ratio over time can often offer a clearer picture of a company's finances.\n\nA company that seems to have an acceptable current ratio could be trending toward a situation in which it will struggle to pay its bills. Conversely, a company that may appear to be struggling now could be making good progress toward a healthier current ratio.\n\nIn the first case, the trend of the current ratio over time would be expected to harm the company\u2019s valuation. Meanwhile, an improving current ratio could indicate an opportunity to invest in an undervalued stock amid a turnaround.\n\nImagine two companies with a current ratio of 1.00 today. Though they may appear to have the same level of risk, analysts would have different expectations for each company depending on how the current ratio of each had changed over time.\n\nIn this example, the trend for Company B is negative, meaning the current ratio is decreasing over time.\n\nAn analyst or investor seeing these numbers would need to investigate further to see what is causing the negative trend.\n\nIt could be a sign that the company is taking on too much debt or that its cash balance is being depleted, either of which could be a solvency issue if the trend worsens.\n\nOn the other hand, the trend for Company A is positive. This could indicate that the company has better collections, fasterinventory turnover, or simply a better ability to pay down its debt.\n\nThe trend is also more stable, with all the values being relatively close together and no sudden jumps or increases from year to year.\n\nAn investor or analyst looking at this trend over time could conclude that the company's finances are likely more stable, too.\n\nThis is markedly different from Company B's current ratio, which demonstrates a higher level ofvolatility.\n\nThere were wider swings from 2020 to 2021. This could mean the shorter-term resources are more inconsistent, making the company perhaps a bit riskier or more unpredictable.\n\nSimilar liquidity ratios can supplement a current ratio analysis. They can help an investor understand the current status of the company\u2019s assets and liabilities from different angles, as well as how those accounts are changing over time.\n\nThe commonly usedacid-test ratio, orquick ratio, compares a company\u2019s easily liquidated assets (including cash, accounts receivable, and short-term investments, and excluding inventory and prepaid expenses) to its current liabilities.\n\nThecash asset ratio, orcash ratio, also is similar to the current ratio, but it only compares a company\u2019s marketable securities and cash to its current liabilities.\n\nCompanies may use the days sales outstanding metric to better understand how long it takes for a company to collect payments after credit sales have been made.\n\nWhile the current ratio looks at the liquidity of the company overall, days sales outstanding calculates liquidity specifically to determine how well a company collects outstanding accounts receivables.\n\nFinally, theoperating cash flow ratiocompares a company\u2019s activecash flow from operating activities (CFO)to its current liabilities. This allows a company to better gauge funding capabilities by omitting implications created by accounting entries.\n\nOne limitation of the current ratio emerges when using it to compare different companies with one another.\n\nBusinesses differ substantially among industries; comparing the current ratios of companies across different industries may not lead to productive insight.\n\nFor example, in one industry, it may be more typical toextend creditto clients for 90 days or longer, while in another industry, short-term collections are more critical.\n\nIronically, the industry that extends more credit actually may have a superficially stronger current ratio because its current assets would be higher.\n\nThe current ratio is most useful when measured over time, compared against a competitor, or compared against a benchmark.\n\nAnother drawback of using the current ratio involves its lack of specificity. Unlike other liquidity ratios, it incorporates all of a company\u2019s current assets, even those that cannot be easily liquidated.\n\nFor example, imagine two companies that both have a current ratio of 0.80 at the end of the lastquarter. On the surface, this may look equivalent, but the quality and liquidity of those assets may be very different:\n\nIn this example, Company A has much more inventory than Company B, which will be harder to turn into cash in the short term. Perhaps this inventory is overstocked or unwanted, which eventually may reduce its value on the balance sheet.\n\nCompany B has more cash, which is the most liquid asset, and more accounts receivable, which could be collected more quickly than liquidating inventory. Although the total value of current assets matches, Company B is in a more liquid, solvent position.\n\nAlso, the current liabilities of Company A and Company B are very different. Company A has more accounts payable, while Company B has a greater amount in short-term notes payable.\n\nThis would be worth more investigation because it is likely that the accounts payable will have to be paid before the entire balance of the notes-payable account. Company A also has fewer wages payable, which is the liability most likely to be paid in the short term.\n\nAlthough both companies seem similar, Company B is likely in a more liquid and solvent position. An investor can dig deeper into the details of a current ratio comparison byevaluating other liquidity ratiosthat are more narrowly focused than the current ratio.\n\nThat depends on the company\u2019s industry and historical performance. Current ratios over 1.00 indicate that a company's current assets are greater than its current liabilities. This means that it could pay all of its short-term debts and bills. A current ratio of 1.50 or greater would generally indicate ample liquidity.\n\nAs a general rule, a current ratio below 1.00 indicates that a company could struggle to meet its short-term obligations. If a company's current ratio is less than one, it may have more bills to pay than easily accessible financial resources with which to pay those bills.\n\nA current ratio of 1.5 indicates that a company has $1.50 of current assets for every $1 of current liabilities. It appears to have more than enough to meet current obligations\n\nTo calculate the current ratio, divide a company\u2019s current assets by its current liabilities. Both are listed on a company's balance sheet. Current assets are those that can be converted into cash within one year, while current liabilities are obligations expected to be paid within one year. Current assets include cash, inventory, and accounts receivable. Current liabilities include accounts payable, wages payable, and the current portion of any scheduled interest or principal payment.\n\nThe current ratio is a liquidity measurement used to track how easily a company can meet its short-term debt obligations. It compares current assets to current liabilities. Measurements of less than 1.0 indicate a company's potential inability to pay what it owes in the short term.\n\nSince assets and liabilities change over time, it is helpful to calculate a current ratio from year to year to analyze whether it shows a positive or negative trend.\n\nAccounting Tools. \"Current Ratio Definition.\"",
