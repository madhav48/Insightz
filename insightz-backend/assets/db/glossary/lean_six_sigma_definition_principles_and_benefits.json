  "definition": "Andy Smith is a Certified Financial Planner (CFP\u00ae), licensed realtor and educator with over 35 years of diverse financial management experience. He is an expert on personal finance, corporate finance and real estate and has assisted thousands of clients in meeting their financial goals over his career.\n\nKatrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nLean Six Sigma\u00a0is a business strategy that aims to create efficiencies by identifying the causes of waste and redundancy and developing solutions to address them.\n\nLean Six Sigma is a team-focused managerial approach that seeks to eliminate resource waste and defects to improve performance. It also strives to optimize time, effort, and talent while assuring production quality and organizational processes. Lean Six Sigma essentially teaches that using resources that don\u2019t createvaluefor the end customer is considered wasteful and should be eliminated. It combinesSix Sigmamethods and tools with the Lean manufacturing/Lean enterprisephilosophy.\n\nLean Six Sigma is a combination of lean methodology and Six Sigma strategy. Lean methodology was established by automaker Toyota (TM) in the 1940s. Its purpose was to remove non-value-adding activities from theproductionprocess.\n\nSix Sigma, on the other hand, was established in 1986 by an engineer at U.S. telecommunications company Motorola (MSI) who was inspired by Japan\u2019sKaizenmodel. It wastrademarkedby the company in 1993. Its method seeks to identify and reduce defects in the production process. It also strives to streamline the variability of the production process.\n\nLean Six Sigma emerged in the 1990s as large U.S. manufacturers attempted to compete with Japan\u2019s better-made products. The combination strategy was introduced by Michael George and Robert Lawrence Jr. in their 2002 book \"Lean Six Sigma: Combining Six Sigma with Lean Speed.\"\n\nCompanies can arrange for Lean Six Sigmatraining and certificationfrom a wide selection of organizations that specialize in the approaches of Lean Six Sigma and Six Sigma.\n\nThe Lean in this concept refers to any method, measure, or tool that helps in the identification and elimination of waste. The concept focuses on the reduction and elimination of eight kinds of waste known as \u201cDOWNTIME,\u201d an acronym for defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion, and extra-processing.\n\nThe term \u201cSix Sigma\u201d refers to tools and techniques that are used to improvemanufacturingprocesses. The strategy attempts to identify and eliminate the causes of defects and variations in business and manufacturing processes.\n\nSix Sigma\u2019s DMAIC phases are utilized in Lean Six Sigma. The acronym stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control\u2014all of which are explored in more detail below. Together, they refer to the data-driven five-step method for improving, optimizing, and stabilizing business and manufacturing processes.\n\nA Lean Six Sigma approach that combines lean strategy and Six Sigma\u2019s tools and techniques highlights processes that are prone to waste, defects, and variation and then reduces them to ensure improvement in a company\u2019s operational processes.\n\nThe techniques and tools used to accomplish essential goals of the Lean Six Sigma strategy include:\n\nLean Six SigmaJust-In-Time (JIT)training allows employees to focus resources on what customers need and when they need it, rather than building up unnecessary inventory.\n\nThe DMAIC phases of Lean Six Sigma are used to identify and improve existing process problems with unknown root causes.\n\nDMAIC works best when used to solve a problem relating to a process, quality, or waste issue in an organization.\n\nLean Six Sigma training uses belts to denote Lean Six Sigma expertise. The exact specifications for each belt may differ depending on what organization provides the certification.\n\nThe benefits of Lean Six Sigma methods extend to employees, customers, vendors, and the company:\n\nLean Six Sigma and Six Sigma are two related strategies that can solve process problems. Both can help companies make noteworthy improvements in quality, efficiency, and use of time by analyzing the way their processes function. Both use the DMAIC phases/method. Both are based on creating a problem-solving workplace culture.\n\nSix Sigma is focused on reducing defects and process variability to improve process output and quality to meet customer expectations. Lean Six Sigma is focused on reducing or eliminating the wasteful use of resources and defects to improve workflow and create more value for customers.\n\nLean Six Sigma combines aspects of Six Sigma (such as data analysis) and aspects of the Lean methodology (such as waste-eliminating tools) to improve process flow, maintain continuous improvement, and achieve business goals.\n\nMany consider Lean Six Sigma important for the measurable and consistent improvements in operations and business results that companies achieve using it. It also might be considered important because it combines the significant process streamlining of the Lean methodology of the 1940s with the Six Sigma data-driven approach of the 1980s.\n\nLean Six Sigma training instructs students in the basics of\u00a0Six Sigma methodology, as well as the Six Sigma\u00a0DMAIC roadmap. Students also learn how to apply\u00a0the concepts\u00a0in practical scenarios as they go through the courses.\n\nThe cost of Lean Six Sigma Training varies depending on whether you do self-study or take courses online (taught live by a virtual instructor) or in person, as well as the level of belt you are pursuing.\n\nSelf-study White Belt training is available for free, for what is described as \u201ca limited time,\u201d while online White Belt training is $99.Online training starts at Yellow Belt for $299, with Green Belt for $399, Black Belt for $499, and Master Black Belt for $699. The courses are self-paced and take anywhere from one to seven weeks.\n\nAn eight-day, in-person classroom Master Black Belt training, done over two weeks, costs $4,975.A three- to four-day course in Lean Fundamentals ranges from $1,300 to $2,000 for in-person training and $399 to $784 for online training.\n\nLean Six Sigma is a management approach and method that endeavors to eliminate the wasteful use of resources plus defects in production processes to improve employee and company performance. It draws on the Lean concept of the 1940s established by Toyota to reduce waste and the Six Sigma strategy of the 1980s established by Motorola to reduce defects. By combining these teachings, Lean Six Sigma puts the best of both to work to streamline efficient operations and financial outcomes for all kinds of organizations.\n\nLearnLean6Sigma. \"14 Principles of the Toyota Production System: A Comprehensive Guide.\"\n\nGLSS. \"Six Sigma Timeline: A History of Excellence.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Lean Six Sigma Certification and Training - Overview.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"DMAIC: Approach to Continuous Improvement.\"\n\nTheLeanSuite.com. \"The Most Popular Lean Six Sigma Tools and Techniques.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Know How to Pick a Right Project for DMAIC.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Six Sigma White Belt.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Six Sigma Yellow Belt.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Six Sigma Green Belt.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Six Sigma Black Belt.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Six Sigma Master Black Belt.\"\n\n6Sigma.us. \"Online White Belt.\"\n\nSixSigmaOnline.org. \"Lean Six Sigma White Belt Training & Certification (Free).\"\n\nSixSigmaCertificationOnline.com. \"Six Sigma Belt Comparison: Which Six Sigma Certification Is Right for You?\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Master Black Belt Training.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Lean Fundamentals Online Training.\"\n\nSix Sigma. \"Lean Fundamentals.\"",
