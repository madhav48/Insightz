  "term": "Weak Sister",
  "definition": "\"Weak sister\" is a slang term for an element that undermines an entire system. The term can either refer to a single individual or a specialized group that is considered to be the weak and undependable link in an integrated process.\n\nWeak sisters are what hold someone or something back. It could be a malfunctioning part of a team-oriented task, such as the slowest member of anassembly lineor a sluggishmarketingteam. Alternatively, it may describe a security, economy, or business unit that performs worse than others.\n\nWeak sister is similar to the term the \u201cweakest link in the chain.\u201d Both refer to someone or something\u00a0that risks single-handedly bringing about the failure of the system or the group it belongs to. \u201cWeakest link\u201d\u00a0came from the proverb\u00a0\u201ca chain is only as strong as its weakest link.\u201d In other words, one substandard link may cause a chain to break, even though the other, stronger links may hold when put under pressure.\n\nThis saying can be traced to the work of Thomas Reid. InEssays on the Intellectual Powers of Man,\u00a0published in the mid-1780s, Reid Wrote: \u201cIn every chain of reasoning, the evidence of the last conclusion can be no greater than that of the weakest link of the chain, whatever may be the strength of the rest.\u201d\n\nWeak sisters can appear in every industry. For instance, in aninvestmentportfolio, there is usually at least onelaggardthat weighs on total returns.\n\nFor example, suppose there is an investor, Mark, who has invested in five differentstocks: Company A, Company B, Company C, Company D, and Company E. Over the past three years, four of the five stocks have done admirably, comfortably beating the rest of thestock marketwith returns between 17% and 40%.\n\nUnfortunately, that impressive performance has been undermined somewhat by the weak sister. Company C returned just 2% because a large chunk of the business (itsenergy arm) experienced tepiddemandfor its products and services as a result of a fall in the price of oil. Tricky trading conditions in that division ended up weighing on the average return of the whole portfolio, bringing it in line with the market average (or below if you factor in fees).\n\nWeak sisters can also refer to entire countries. Following thegreat recession, Europe struggled to pay off all thedebtsit had accumulated, in what became known as the Eurozone debt crisis.\n\nFive of the region\u2019s countries\u2014Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, and\u00a0Spain\u2014took the majority of the blame. These nations were accused of lackingfiscalprudence, not generating enougheconomic growth,and being at risk of defaultingon their bonds.\n\nJust because something or someone is referred to as a weak sister does not mean it is beyond saving. Weak sisters might not always be undependable. In many cases, what struggled and held everything back one year might bounce back in the next one.\n\nFor instance, once the oil price rebounds, Company C might likely go from the weak sister to the biggestoutperformerin Mark\u2019s portfolio.\u00a0Jitteryinvestorspushed the valuation down to reflect the challenges facing the sector. That means the stock will look incredibly cheap if sentiment improves and trading picks up again.\n\nMarket cyclesand business trading conditions shift over time, leading variousasset classesto fall in and out of favor. For many investors, there\u2019s lots of money to be made from identifying weak sisters and determining, before the rest of the market, when they have bottomed out.\n\nWeak sisters can also become stronger with a few important tweaks made from the inside. Certaincapital expenditure(CAPEX) orcost-cuttingstrategies can transform a bloated, misfiring laggard into a much leaner and meaner proposition.\n\nGood Reads. \"Essays on the Intellectual Power of Man Quotes.\" Accessed June 25, 2021.",
