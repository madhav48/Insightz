  "definition": "Charlene Rhinehart is a CPA , CFE, chair of an Illinois CPA Society committee, and has a degree in accounting and finance from DePaul University.\n\nSuzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nProperty refers to any asset, whether tangible or intangible, that an individual or business legally owns, granting them specific, legally protected rights to access, manage, or pass on those assets.\n\nProperty is a term describing anything that a person or a business has legal title over, affording owners certain enforceable rights over said items. Examples of property, which may be tangible or intangible, include automotive vehicles, industrial equipment, furniture, and real estate\u2014the last of which is often referred to as \"real property.\"\n\nMost properties hold current or potential monetary value and are therefore considered to be assets. But properties can simultaneously be liabilities in some situations. Case in point: if a customer sustains an injury on a company's property, the business owner may be legally responsible for paying the injured party's medical bills.\n\nIntangible property describes assets, such as stock and bond certificates, that represent current or potential value but don't carry intrinsic value.\n\nWhile these items are merely pieces of paper, they might represent significant amounts of money. Other types of intangible property, such as a brand\u2019s reputation, are more nebulous and cannot be signified by a paper document.\n\nIntangible properties, like design concepts, song lyrics, books, and screenplays, are categorized as intellectual properties. Even though these are not physical in nature, they may carry significant value. Examples of intellectual properties include Nike\u2019s \u201cswoosh\u201d logo and the chemical formula for Coca-Cola.\n\nTo enforce ownership ofintangible properties, individuals and businesses typically hire lawyers to legally protect their items from infringement.\n\nProperty, in the broad sense, describes anything that a person, group of people, or entity owns. It includes real property, personal property, private property, government-owned property, and more.\n\nReal propertyis one of the most familiar types of property. It includes land, buildings occupying the land, and the rights to use and enjoy the land.\n\nReal property is the focal point of real estate, which deals with transactions (e.g., buying, selling, renting, and managing) involving land and buildings used for residential, commercial, and agricultural use.\n\nJust as there are various types of property, there are different types of interests in property. Interests in real property include freehold estates and non-freehold estates.\n\nFreehold estates are ownership interests that have no expiration and can be inherited. Non-freehold estates, or leasehold estates, are not transferrable and have expiration; such estates include leases and other rental agreements.\n\nProperty law stipulates how real property can be used and the manner in which it can be legally transferred.\n\nPersonal propertyis as well-known as real property but differs in that it does not include real estate (e.g., land and buildings attached to the land). Personal property is property that can be physically transferred and is not permanently attached to the land. It includes clothing, automobiles, furniture, tools, and more.\n\nPersonal property also includes intangible assets, such as bank accounts, patents, and investments. Although they are not physically movable, rights remain with the person or entity listed as the legal owner, making them personal property.\n\nPrivate property is any property owned by a natural person or private entity. It includes personal, real, tangible, and intangible assets, includingintellectual property. Private property is often categorized as real or personal; however, not all real or personal property is private property.\n\nPrivate property is not open to the public, nor is it owned by a government. Governments can, however, assume ownership of private property under certain circumstances, such as eminent domain.\n\nGovernment-owned propertyincludes all property, including real property, resources, and other tangible and intangible assets, owned by a government body.\n\nIn contrast to private property, most government-owned properties are public. For example, libraries, public schools, and city parks are government-owned property available to the public.\n\nHowever, all government-owned property is not accessible to the public, and some publicly accessible property is not always available to the public.\n\nFor instance, a city park may have a curfew, after which the public cannot access it. A government-owned property, such as a military research facility or lab, may not be accessible at all to the public.\n\nSometimes private property can be escheated to a local government body, rendering it temporarily or permanently government-owned. Also, in some cases, the private property owner forfeits or sells their property rights to the government.\n\nWhen auditors, appraisers, and analysts calculate the value of a business, they factor all of its underlying property into the equation.\n\nFor example, a manufacturer of small machine parts may gross just $80,000 per year, but if it owns the factory in which it operates, and that building is appraised at $1 million, the overall value of the business would be substantially higher than profits alone suggest.\n\nFurthermore, if that same company holds a patent for a part, it has the potential to generate substantial income by licensing the rights to manufacture that item to a larger business, rather than producing the part in-house. In this way, licensing deals may create lucrative revenue streams that significantly boost a company\u2019s overall value.\n\nAn individual'snet worthmay be determined by calculating the total value of the properties they own, such as real estate, cars, jewelry, stocks, bonds, and retirement savings, and then subtracting any liabilities or debts from that figure.\n\nFor example, if an individual's assets include a $100,000 home, a $7,000 car, and a $65,000 IRA, the tally of their property comes to $172,000.\n\nBut if that same individual is saddled with a $20,000 student loan and a $3,000 credit card bill, the total liabilities add up to $23,000. Thus, the total net worth would be $149,000 ($172,000 - $23,000).\n\nLocating the owner of a property can be done through an online search on a county assessor's website, with a court clerk, by soliciting the help of a real estate broker or attorney, or through a general online search.\n\nProperty taxes aredeterminedby multiplying a tax rate, determined by the local tax authority, by the assessed value of the property. If the value of a property is $100,000 and the tax rate is 4%, the property taxes are $4,000.\n\nA property appraiser is responsible for assessing the market value of a property for real estate transactions. In contrast, a property assessor assesses the value of a property for tax purposes.\n\nProperty includes the tangible and intangible assets a person or entity has title to and rights to use. There are various forms of property, each carrying its own set of rules for classification and use.\n\nOften, some assets may be classified as more than one type of property. A house is both real property and private property in some instances. A computer can be personal property or government-owned. It is important to understand the different types and the rights associated with them.",
