  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nProduct differentiation distinguishes one company's products or services from its competition. Successful product differentiation leads to brand loyalty and sales. A product differentiation strategy identifies and communicates the unique qualities of a product or company while highlighting the differences between that product or company and its competitors. Product differentiation can create acompetitive advantagefor the product's seller and buildbrand awareness.\n\nProduct differentiation isa marketing strategyto encourage consumers to choose one brand or product over another. It identifies the qualities that set one product apart fromsimilar productsand uses those differences to driveconsumer choice. Differentiation marketing may also focus on aniche market.\n\nDifferentiating qualities may be reflected in a product's packaging, marketing promotion, or brand name. A strategy may require adding new functional features or might be as simple as redesigning packaging. Sometimes, differentiation marketing does not require any changes to the product but a new advertising campaign or otherpromotions.\n\nThe differences between products can be physical or measurable, such as the lowest-price gym in a region. However, the differences between the products could be more abstract such as a car company claiming their cars are the most luxurious. Product differentiation aims to alter a consumer's interpretation of the benefits of one item compared to another. The actual difference in the productcompared with competing productsmight be small or nonexistent.\n\nCompanies that achieve high\u00a0market research\u00a0metrics forbrand loyaltyand customer loyalty growrevenues2.5 times faster than industry peers and deliver two to five times thereturnsto\u00a0shareholders\u00a0over 10-year time frames, according to a study by the Harvard Business Review.\n\nAn example of product differentiation is when a company emphasizes a characteristic of a new product to market that sets it apart from others already on the market. For instance, Tesla differentiates itself from other auto brands because their cars are innovative, battery-operated, and advertised as high-end.\n\nWhen functional aspects of two products are identical, nonfunctional features can be highlighted. Differentiation marketing can help companies stand out when a product isn't perceived as much different from a competitor's, such as bottled water. The strategy might be to focus on a lower price point or that it's a locally owned business. The strategy can be an appealing change in design or styling.\n\nProduct differentiation allows different brands or companies to gain a competitive advantage in the market. If differentiation were unachievable, the bigger companies with economies of scale would always dominate the market because they can undercut smaller producers in price.\n\nProduct differentiation allows products and brands to command market share based on consumer preferences. Customers choose products for price, brand image, quality, durability, taste, color, or a temporary trend. If a product can differentiate itself from its competitors and appeal to consumers, it will have a competitive advantage.\n\nHarvard Business Review. \u201cAre You Undervaluing Your Customers?\u201d\n\nTesla. \"The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan.\"",
