  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nJiwon Ma is a fact checker and research analyst with a background in cybersecurity, international security, technology, and privacy policies.

An unencumbered asset is much easier to sell or transfer than one with anencumbrance. Examples of common unencumbered assets are houses free from mortgages and other liens, cars with paid-off loans/notes, or stocks purchased in acash account.\n\nCreditors do not have claims to unencumbered assets as there are no associated debts. As a result, these assets are the full property of the person(s) listed as the owner(s) in an official capacity, such as on a title or deed. Unencumbered assets are not listed ascollateralfor any debt and are not subject to competing claims, such as past-due property taxes.\n\nFor the majority of consumers, especially young couples and recent graduates, high-value assets, such as real estate and cars, are unlikely to be unencumbered. This is because these purchases are often financed, leading to debt acquisition, with the asset as collateral. Over time, as the mortgage or car loan is paid off, these assets become unencumbered. Atitle searchis a key part of the due diligence process for a buyer of real estate or a used car to confirm that the asset is unencumbered or has outstanding liens.\n\nUnencumbered assets are easier to transfer because only the property owner, acting as the seller, and the party interested in purchasing the property, acting as the buyer, must approve the sale. Further, there is no predetermined required sale price, allowing the seller to set the price at their discretion.\n\nEncumbered assets can be sold, but the sale process requires approval by the buyer and seller, as well as any other entity that has a claim to the asset, such as the bank that issued the loan for the collateralized asset.This can lead to minimum sales price requirements, often in an amount equal to or above thecollateralizeddebt amount against the subject property. This allows the debt to be effectively paid off as part of the sales transaction.\n\nIn most bankruptcy proceedings involving liquidations, encumbered assets are first considered the property of those holding rights to the property through the encumbrance, allowing the institution to recoup some of the losses through the acquisition and a possible later sale of the assets in question.\n\nIn some cases, unencumbered assets do not have a predetermined owner if the assets are liquidated in bankruptcy. This allows the value of any liquidated unencumbered assets to be distributed to creditors who extended unsecured credit.\n\nIn certain circumstances, the IRS, state, or even local taxing authorities can place a lien on previously unencumbered property to collect past-due taxes.\n\nYes, since you own the property free and clear, you can set the sale price and sell it to whomever you like.\n\nIt simply means that whoever owns the property owns it outright. There are no debts like mortgages or other personal loans on the property.\n\nAn unencumbered asset could be something like a car that you've paid off or a home that you own outright.\n\nEven though you might start by owning an encumbered asset, like a home or a vehicle, you can eventually own it free and clear. Once you've completely repaid the debt, the property becomes unencumbered and you have sole discretion over what to do with it.\n\nU.S. Department of Justice. \u201cList of Changes and Updates to the Handbook for Chapter 7 Trustees,\u201d Page 3.\n\nAmerican Bar Association. \u201cBuying Assets in Bankruptcy: Has the Second Circuit Taken the Wind Out of Sales Free and Clear?\u201d\n\nLupica, Lois R. \u201cAsset Securitization: The Unsecured Creditor\u2019s Perspective.\u201dTexas Law Review,vol. 76, 1998, pp. 597.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Understanding a Federal Tax Lien.\"",
