  "term": "Brownfield Investment: Definition, Advantages, Vs. Greenfield",
  "definition": "A brownfield (also known as \"brown-field\") investment is when a company or government entity purchases orleasesexisting production facilities to launch a new production activity. This is one strategy used inforeign direct investment.\n\nThe alternative to this is agreenfield investment, in which a new plant is constructed. The clear advantage of a brownfield investment strategy is that the buildings are already constructed. The costs and time of starting up may thus be greatly reduced and the buildings already up to code.\n\nBrownfield land, however, may have been abandoned or left unused for good cause, such aspollution, soil contamination, or the presence of hazardous materials.\n\nBrownfield investing covers both the purchase and the lease of existing facilities. At times, this approach may be preferable, as the structure already stands. Not only can it result in cost savings for the investing business, but it can also avoid certain steps that are required to build new facilities on empty lots, such as building permits and connecting utilities.\n\nBrownfield sites may be found in unattractive locations, making it harder to develop for the public or employees. So if investors can\u2019t be attracted, it won\u2019t be able to sustain itself.\n\nThe term brownfield refers to the fact that the land itself may be contaminated by the prior activities that have taken place on the site, a side effect of which may be the lack of vegetation on the property. When a property owner has no intention of allowing further use of vacant brownfield property, it is referred to as a mothballed brownfield. Sites that are significantly contaminated, such as by extreme hazardous waste, are not considered to be brownfield properties.\n\nBrownfield investing is common when a company looks toward a foreign direct investment (FDI) option. Often, a company considers facilities that are either no longer in use or are not running at full capacity as options for new or additional production.\n\nTheEnvironmental Protection Agency(EPA) has a program known as the \"Brownfields and Land Revitalization Program\" that seeks to revitalize land by providing grants and technical assistance.\n\nWhile additional equipment may be required, or existing equipment may need to be modified, this can often be more cost-effective than building a new facility from the ground up. This is especially true in cases where the previous use is similar in nature to the new intended use.\n\nThe addition of new equipment is still considered part of a brownfield investment, while the addition of any new facilities to complete production do not qualify as brownfield. Instead, new facilities are considered greenfield investing.\n\nWhilebrownfield investinginvolves the use of previously constructed facilities that were once in use for another purpose,greenfield investingcovers any situation in which new facilities are added to previously vacant land. The term greenfield relates to the idea that, before the construction of a new facility, the land may have literally been a green field, such as an empty pasture, covered in green foliage prior to use.\n\nBrownfield investments can run the risk of leading tobuyer's remorse. Even if the premises had been previously used for a similar operation, it is rare that a company looking finds a facility with the type of capital equipment and technology to suit its purposes completely. If the property is leased, there may be limitations on what kinds of improvements can be made.",
