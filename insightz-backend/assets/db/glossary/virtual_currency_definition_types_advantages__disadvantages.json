It is stored and transacted through designated mobile or computer applications. Transactions involving virtual currencies occur through secure, dedicated networks or the internet. They are generally issued by private parties or groups of developers and are mostly unregulated.\n\nVirtual currencies are a form ofdigital currency. They are issued by private parties, such as a group of developers or organizations, and do not have a physical form like paper money. They include cryptocurrencies and other tokens that hold value.\n\nThey differ from officially issued digital currencies calledcentral bank digital currency (CBDC).\n\nVirtual currencies have been around for many years, but it's only since Bitcoin was introduced that it became important to define the different types of digital currencies. These definitions may change over time as regulators, academics, and interested parties learn more and become more familiar with them.\n\nAs of June 2024, regulations covering virtual currencies, tokens, and assets are still emerging around the world. For example, in 2023, The European Union published a broad definition in its Markets In Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation. \"Crypto-assets are digital representations of value or of rights that have the potential to bring significant benefits to market participants, including retail holders of crypto-assets.\" According to this rule, a virtual currency may not fall under MiCA jurisdiction in the EU, but it might if it meets this very vague definition.\n\nTheInternal Revenue Service (IRS)in the United States describes virtual currencies as \"digital representations of value, other than a representation of the U.S. dollar or a foreign currency (\"real currency\"), that function as a unit of account, a store of value, and a medium of exchange.\"It also taxes trades involving certain virtual currency types, such as cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe market watchdog, theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has brought U.S.-basedcryptocurrencyexchanges under its supervision and continues to scrutinize all crypto-related products, services, and providers.\n\nVirtual currencies have many forms, so there are endless ways that they can be used. Cryptocurrency is most commonly purchased and sold by investors and traders on cryptocurrency exchanges to profit from price fluctuations and increases.\n\nHowever, they are also used in some countries by people who don't have access to other payment methods or financial services. In its 2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report, blockchain and crypto-assets analysis firm Chainalysis reported that cryptocurrency adoption is down from previous years; however, lower-middle-income countries are adopting these currencies at a much higher rate than others.\n\nMany video games offer virtual currencies you can buy with real money and use to purchase items in-game. Most of these in-game currencies and tokens are not usable outside the game and cannot be transferred. However, there are blockchain-based games that use in-game currency which can be purchased with cryptocurrency. In this case, both currencies are virtual currencies because real-world value is being transferred.\n\nDepending on their operating network, virtual currencies are classified as either closed or open.\n\nAs the name suggests, aclosed virtual currencyoperates in a controlled and private ecosystem. It cannot be converted into another virtual currency or a real-world fiat currency. Examples of closed virtual currencies are currencies in gaming systems. Though such currencies can be used in their respective environments (in this case, games), they cannot generally be converted into real-world cash.\n\nAirline miles, while not typically thought of as currency, are closed virtual currencies. They are issued by private parties, can only be used to redeem specific items, and cannot be converted into an associated monetary value.\n\nOpen virtual currencies operate in open ecosystems and can be converted into another currency within or outside the platform. Examples of open virtual currencies are stablecoins and cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin and Ethereum, the two biggest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, can be converted into other cryptocurrencies or certainfiat currencies. This conversion process can trigger taxes, depending on how long you hold your cryptocurrency and its market value when you purchased and sold it.\n\nThough most open virtual currencies have a decentralized setup, some cryptocurrencies might be centralized in design, meaning a central agency is responsible for their production and distribution.\n\nThe in-game currency used in blockchain-based games might be considered an open virtual currency if it can be sold back to the game or to another user.\n\nThe advantages of virtual currencies are as follows:\n\nThe disadvantages of virtual currencies are as follows:\n\nEven though they sound alike and function in a similar manner, digital, virtual, and cryptocurrencies are, in fact, different. Listed below are the main points of difference between the three types of currencies:\n\nIf something is generally accepted as a means of exchange, a store of value, or a unit of account, it is considered by most to be money. Virtual money can meet this definition, but not always. For example, virtual money earned in a video game used to purchase in-game items is likely not real money. But if it transitions somehow to being exchanged for money that meets this definition, it could become real money.\n\nDefinitions are constantly changing, but by the most currently used ones, cryptocurrency is a form of virtual currency.\n\nBitcoin is by far the most valuable and popular virtual currency. It took the market by storm in the mid-2010s and has held the top spot for price and market cap ever since.\n\nVirtual currencies are digital representations of value that can exist only electronically. Their transactions occur on online networks or the internet. Examples of virtual currencies include tokens and cryptocurrencies.\n\nVirtual currencies are a novel form of currency and, as such, are mostly unregulated. But that situation is changing, and an increasing number of government agencies and countries are considering the implications of introducing virtual currencies into their economies.\n\nThe comments, opinions, and analyses expressed on Investopedia are for informational purposes only.
