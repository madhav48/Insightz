  "definition": "The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is astock exchangelocated in New York City that is the largestequities-based exchange in the world, based on the totalmarket capitalizationof its listed securities.\n\nFormerly run as a private organization, the NYSE became a public entity on March 8, 2006, following the acquisition of electronic trading exchangeArchipelago.In 2007, a merger withEuronext\u2014the largest stock exchange in Europe\u2014led to the creation of NYSE Euronext, which was later acquired by Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (ICE), the current parent of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nLocated on Wall Street in New York City,the New York Stock Exchange\u2014also known as the \"Big Board\"\u2014 consists of one trading floor for equities and another for the NYSE Americanoptionsexchange. The main building located at 18 Broad St. and the one at 11 Wall St. were both designated historical landmarks in 1978.\n\nThe NYSE relied for many years on floor trading only, using theopen outcrysystem. Many NYSE trades have transitioned to electronic systems relying mainly ondesignated market makersto conduct both the physical and automated auctions. Quotes offered by DMMs are on par with whatfloor tradersand other market participants offer.\n\nCurrently, the NYSE is open for trading Monday through Friday from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET. The stock exchange is closed on certain U.S. holidays. When these fall on a Saturday, the NYSE is sometimes closed the preceding Friday. When holidays fall on a Sunday, the NYSE may be closed the following Monday.\n\nThe NYSE is the world's largest stock exchange by total market capitalization oflisted companies, which is estimated to be $24.6 trillion as of Mid-2022.\n\nThe opening and closing bells of the exchange mark the beginning and end of the trading day. Theopening bellis rung at 9:30 a.m. ET, and\u00a0theclosing bellis rung at 4:00 p.m. ET, closing trading for the day. But trading days did not always begin and end with a bell\u2014the original signal was actually a gavel. During the late 1800s, the NYSE changed the gavel to a gong. The bell became the official signal for the exchange in 1903 when the NYSE moved to 18 Broad St.\n\nPrior to 1995, the exchange's floor managers rang the bells. But the NYSE began inviting company executives to ring the opening and closing bells on a regular basis, which later became a daily event. The executives are from companies listed on the exchange, who sometimes coordinate their appearances with marketing events, such as the launch of a new product or innovation, or a merger oracquisition.\n\nSometimes, other public figures, such as athletes and celebrities, ring the bell. Some of the more notable figures to ring it include singer/actor Liza Minnelli, Olympic medalist Michael Phelps,\u00a0and rapper Snoop Dogg. In July 2013, United Nations Secretary Ban Ki-moon rang the closing bell to mark the NYSE joining the U.N. Sustainable Stock Exchanges Initiative.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange passed the milestone of one million shares traded in a single day in 1888. By 2022, more than five billion shares were changing hands on the NYSE during a normal business day.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange dates back to May 17, 1792. On that day, 24 stockbrokers from New York City signed theButtonwood Agreementat 68 Wall St. The New York Stock Exchange kicked off with five securities, which included three government bonds and two bank stocks.\n\nThanks to the NYSE's head start as the major U.S. stock exchange, many of theoldest publicly traded companiesare on the exchange. Consolidated Edison (ED) is the longest-listed NYSE stock, joining in 1824 as the New York Gas Light Company.Along with American stocks, foreign-based corporations can also list their shares on the NYSE if they adhere to certain listing standards.\n\nA series ofmergershas\u00a0given the New York Stock Exchange its massive size and global presence.
