  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAmanda Bellucco-Chatham is an editor, writer, and fact-checker with years of experience researching personal finance topics. Specialties include general financial planning, career development, lending, retirement, tax preparation, and credit.\n\nWholesale banking refers to banking services sold to large clients, such as other banks, other financial institutions, government agencies, large corporations, and real estate developers. It is the opposite ofretail banking, which focuses on individual clients and small businesses. Wholesale banking services include currency conversion, working capital financing, large trade transactions,mergers and acquisitions, consultancy, and underwriting, among other services.\n\nIn its essence, wholesale banking is the financial practice of lending and borrowing between two large institutions. The types of services are provided by investment banks that often also offer retail banking.\ufeffThis means that an individual looking for wholesale banking wouldn't have to go to a special institution and could instead engage the same bank in which he conducts his personal retail banking.\n\nThe services that are considered \"wholesale\" are reserved only for government agencies, pension funds, corporations with strong financials, and other institutional customers of a similar nature. It is for entities that require more service than an individual or a small business, and one that needs it on a large scale. Because of the large scale, the prices offered for these services are typically lower than what is offered to an individual.\n\nWholesale banking also refers to the borrowing and lending between institutional banks. This type of lending occurs on theinterbank marketand often involves extremely large sums of money.\n\nWholesale and retail banking are distinct sectors within the banking industry, catering to different customer segments and needs. Wholesale banking focuses on institutional clients, such as corporations, governments, large businesses, financial institutions, and high-net-worth individuals. Retail banking focuses on individual customers and small businesses.\n\nWholesale banking handles large-scale financial transactions, while retail banking handles small to medium-sized transactions including everyday banking activities. Wholesale banks tend to offer a range of sophisticated financial products and services, while retail banks provide standardized banking products and services to individual customers.\n\nVery broadly speaking, wholesale banking focuses on building long-term, strategic relationships with corporate clients. On the other hand, retail banking emphasizes customer service and building relationships with individual customers. Retail banking focuses on smaller, more standardized transactions with lower risk profiles; as such, retail banking may be seen as having lower risk as the client base often have less assets or resources. Despite their differences, many banks operate in both sectors, providing a diverse range of financial services to cater to a wide range of clients' needs.\n\nMany financial institutions offer both retail and wholesale banking. For example, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank, Bank of America, and many other large banks supports both industries.\n\nWholesale banking provides a number of benefits, not only to financial institutions but also to the customers they serve at the institutional level.\n\nWholesale banking may also come with a few possible drawbacks; the following is a list of some of the drawbacks of wholesale banking.\n\nA 2023 evaluation of the wholesale banking sector by PwC led to the consulting firm stating the upcoming challenge of the industry is \"balancing the growing complexities of daily operations within the wholesale banking industry with a focus on the extended time horizons of an enterprise-wide transformation\".\n\nThe easiest way to conceptualize wholesale banking is to think of it as a discount superstore, like Costco, that deals in such large amounts that it can offer special prices or reduced fees, on a per-dollar basis. It becomes advantageous for large organizations or institutions with a high amount of assets or business transactions to engage in wholesale banking services rather than retail banking services.\n\nFor example, there are many occasions when a business with multiple locations needs a wholesale banking solution for cash management. Technology companies withsatellite officesare a prime candidate for these services. Let's say that a SaaS (software-as-a-service) company has 10 sales offices distributed around the United States, and each of its 50 sales team members has access to a corporate credit card. The owners of the SaaS company also require that each sales office keeps $1 million in cash reserves, totaling $10 million across the business. It's easy to see that a company with this profile is too large for standard retail banking.\n\nInstead, the business owners can engage a bank and request a corporate facility that keeps all the company'sfinancial accounts. Wholesale banking services act like a facility that offers discounts if a business meets minimum cash reserve requirements and minimum monthly transaction requirements, both of which the SaaS company will hit.\n\nIt is thus beneficial for the business to engage in a corporate facility that consolidates all its financial accounts and reduces its fees, rather than keeping 10 retail checking accounts and 50 retail credit cards open.\n\nWholesale banking offers a range of services, including corporate banking, investment banking, treasury management, trade finance, risk management, and capital market solutions.\n\nCompanies should consider factors such as the bank's expertise, reputation, global reach, services offered, industry knowledge, and relationship-building capabilities when choosing a wholesale bank.\n\nWholesale banking supports economic growth by providing capital for large-scale projects, facilitating mergers and acquisitions, enabling trade finance, and offering financial expertise and advisory services to businesses and institutions.\n\nWholesale banking offers diverse career opportunities, including roles in corporate banking, investment banking, risk management, treasury services, capital markets, relationship management, and financial advisory.\n\nThe wholesale banking sector provides specialized financial services to institutional clients such as corporations, governments, and large businesses. It encompasses areas such as corporate banking, investment banking, treasury services, risk management, and capital market solutions. Wholesale banks offer tailored products supporting the complex financial needs of their clients compared to retail banking which may prioritize individual customer daily transactions.\n\nPwC. \"Wholesale Banking 2025 and Beyond.\"",
