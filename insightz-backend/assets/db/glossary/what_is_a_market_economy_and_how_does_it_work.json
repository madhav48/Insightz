  "definition": "David is comprehensively experienced in many facets of financial and legal research and publishing. As an Investopedia fact checker since 2020, he has validated over 1,100 articles on a wide range of financial and investment topics.\n\nIn a market economy, the production and pricing of goods and services are driven by buyers and sellers rather than government control.\n\nA market economy is an economic system in which the production of goods and services is determined bysupply and demand. Interactions between consumers and businesses determine what is available and at what price.\n\nMarket economies rely on the forces of supply and demand to determine the appropriate prices and quantities for most goods and services.\n\nEntrepreneurs marshal thefactors of production\u2014land, labor, and capital\u2014and combine them in cooperation with workers and financial backers to produce goods and services for consumers or other businesses to buy.\n\nBuyers and sellers voluntarily agree on the terms of these transactions, including price.\n\nThe allocation of resources by entrepreneurs in different businesses and production processes is determined by the consumerdemandthat they hope to create.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are rewarded with profits that can be reinvested in future business growth. Unsuccessful entrepreneurs adapt and revise their products, or go out of business.\n\nThe United States is an example of a market economy. Its central bank, theFederal Reserve, attempts to maintain a stable economy through its monetary policy and its goals of full employment and low inflation.\n\nIn addition, the U.S.Congresscan pass legislation to boost economic activity or protect consumers.\n\nBut the main driver of theeconomyis the force of supply and demand driven by producers and consumers.\n\nThe theoretical basis for market economies was developed by classical economists such asAdam Smith,David Ricardo, andJean-Baptiste Say.\n\nThese liberalfree marketadvocates believed that the \u201cinvisible hand\u201d of the profit motive and market incentives generally guided economic decisions down more productive and efficient paths than government planning of the economy.\n\nThey argued that government intervention often led to economic inefficiencies that made people in general worse off.\n\nEvery economy in the modern world falls somewhere along a continuum from pure market to fully planned. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because theyblend free markets with some government interference.\n\nThey are labeled market economies because they allow market forces to drive the vast majority of activities, typically engaging in government intervention only to the extent that it is needed to provide stability.\n\nMarket economies may engage in some government interventions, such asprice fixing, licensing,quotas, and industrial subsidies. Most commonly, market economies feature government production ofpublic goods, often as a government monopoly.\n\nBut overall, market economies are characterized by decentralized economic decision-making by buyers and sellers transacting everyday business.\n\nIn particular, market economies are distinguished by having functional markets for corporate control, which allow for the transfer and reorganization of the economic means of production among entrepreneurs.\n\nAlthough the market economy is clearly the modern system of choice, there continues to be significant debate regarding the amount of government intervention considered optimal for efficient economic operations.\n\nMost economists believe that market-oriented economies are most successful at generating wealth, economic growth, and rising living standards for a nation.\n\nHowever, they differ on the precise scope, scale, and specific roles for government intervention that are necessary to provide the fundamental legal and institutional framework that markets need to function well.\n\nLike the U.S., most countries have primarily market economies. Keep in mind, however, that such economies are still influenced to some degree by government policies.\n\nThis may take the form of laws setting minimum wage, subsidies for certain industries or sectors, and policies that prohibit the production and sale of certain products and services due to potential risks to consumers.\n\nAmong some of the largest economies in the world, the following are primarily market economies:\n\nMost modern nations considered to be market economies are mixed economies. That is, supply and demand drive the economy. Interactions between consumers and producers are allowed to determine the goods and services offered and their prices.\n\nHowever, most nations also see the value of a central authority that steps in to prevent malpractice, correct injustices, or provide necessary but unprofitable services. Without government intervention, there can be no worker safety rules, consumer protection laws, emergency relief measures, subsidized medical care, or public transportation systems.\n\nIn a planned economy, the government controls production, distribution, and prices. It makes all of the economic decisions through a central plan, specifically about how to allocate resources in order to meet collective goals.\n\nA market economy, on the other hand, relies on supply and demand to dictate economic decisions such as the allocation of resources. Competition between market participants determines prices.\n\nPlanned economies are focused on stability through state control, which can often lead to inefficiencies. Market economies focus on individual choice, efficiency, and innovation.\n\nCapitalism and a market economy both describe a system that allows the law of supply and demand, not a central government, to determine the production and prices of goods and services.Capitalism, however, is a political philosophy. It maintains that production must remain in private hands and be motivated by the pursuit of private profit.\n\nMost economists say that a market economy system is best able to deliver a high quality of life to most citizens. Its benefits include increased efficiency, steady economic growth, and motivation for innovation. Its potential downsides include the risks of monopolies, exploitation of labor, and income inequality.\n\nA market economy is driven by the law of supply and demand. However, most modern economies could be called mixed economies. That is, the government steps in as needed to stabilize the economy, alleviate problems, or correct injustices.\n\nThe challenge for economists, and for all citizens, is defining the degree of government intervention that is required.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cThe Role of Self-Interest and Competition in a Market Economy\u2014The Economic Lowdown Podcast Series.\u201d\n\nglobalEDGE, Michigan State University. \u201cGet Insights by Country.\u201d",
