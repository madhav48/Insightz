The relative strength or weakness of a nation\u2019s currency has a strong impact on its trade with other nations, on its tourism industry, and on the prices its consumers pay for imports.\n\nExchange ratesare always viewed in relation to the exchange rate of another currency. For example, the exchange rate from U.S. dollars to euros was 1.07 at the end of June 2024. That means one euro could be exchanged for $1.07.\n\nThe exchange rate between any two currencies is commonly determined by interest rates, economic activity, gross domestic product, and the unemployment rate in each of the countries.\n\nCommonly called market exchange rates, currency prices are set in the global marketplace where financial institutions, money managers, and speculatorstrade currenciesaround the clock. This is called the forex or f/x market, although the market has no physical presence and no owner. Changes in rates can occur hourly or daily with small changes or in large incremental shifts.\n\nAn exchange rate is commonly quoted using an acronym for the national currency it represents. USD represents the U.S. dollar. EUR represents the euro.\u00a0It would be EUR/USD if you were quoting the currency pair for the dollar and the euro.\n\nAn exchange of U.S. dollars to Japanese yen is labeled asUSD/JPY. An exchange rate of 100 means that one dollar equals 100 yen.\n\nExchange rates can befree-floating or fixed. A free-floating exchange rate rises and falls due to changes in theforeign exchange market.\u00a0A fixed exchange rate ispeggedto the value of another currency. The Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar in a range of 7.75 to 7.85, so the value of the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar will remain within this range.\n\nExchange rates have aspot rateor cash value that\u2019s the current market value. They may also have a forward value that\u2019s based on expectations for the currency to rise or fall vs. its spot price.\n\nForward rate valuesfluctuatedue to changes in expectations for future interest rates in one country vs. another. Traders may buy the dollar vs. the euro if they speculate that the eurozone will ease monetary policy vs. the U.S., causing a downward trend in the value of the euro.\n\nA traveler to Germany from the United States wants $200 for the equivalent amount of euros on arrival in Germany. The sell rate is the rate at which atraveler sells foreign currencyin exchange for local currency. The buy rate is the rate at which one buys foreign currency back from travelers to exchange it for local currency.\n\nIf the current exchange rate is 1.05, $200 will net \u20ac190.48 in return. In this case, the equation is: dollars \u00f7 exchange rate = euro:\n\nSuppose \u20ac66 is remaining after the trip. The change from euros to dollars will be $67.32 if the exchange rate has dropped to 1.02:\n\nThe Japanese yen is calculated differently. The dollar is placed in front of the yen in this case, as in USD/JPY. The equation for USD/JPY is dollars \u00d7 exchange rate = yen.\n\nA traveler to Japan would get\u00a0\u00a511,000 if they want to convert $100 into yen and the exchange rate is 110. Convert the yen back into dollars by dividing the amount of the currency by the exchange rate:\n\nNote that none of these travelers will be getting the market price when they exchange currency. The bank or currency exchange store that they do business with will add its fee to the transaction.\n\nChanges in exchange rates affect businesses by increasing or decreasing the cost of supplies and finished products that are purchased from another country. It changes, for better or worse, the demand abroad for their exports and the domestic demand for imports. Significant changes in a currency rate can encourage or discourage foreign tourism and investment in a country.\n\nTheforex market, also known as the f/x, is an over-the-counter marketplace for trading currencies. This 24-hour market is responsible for trillions of dollars in daily trading activity as central banks, financial institutions, and speculators swap currencies to profit from their price movements or hedge against future price movements.\n\nA restricted currency has its value set by the government.\n\nSome countries have restricted currencies, meaning they restrict the exchange of their currency to within their borders or establish both an onshore rate and an offshore rate.\n\nChina is an example. The Chinese government sets a midpoint value for the currency every day, allowing the yuan to trade in a band of 2% from this midpoint.\n\nAn exchange rate is the value of one currency in relation to the value of another currency. Most exchange rates are floating and rise or fall based on the supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, but some are pegged to another country\u2019s currency or are fixed in value.\n\nFluctuations in a nation\u2019s exchange rate have an impact on the demand for its products abroad and the prices its consumers pay for imports.\n\nFederal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \u201cU.S. Dollars to Euro Spot Exchange Rate.\u201d\n\nHarvard Business Services. \u201cHow Exchange Rates Affect Your Business.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Monetary Authority. \u201cHow Does the LERS Work?\u201d\n\nTrading Economics. \u201cChinese Yuan.\u201d",
