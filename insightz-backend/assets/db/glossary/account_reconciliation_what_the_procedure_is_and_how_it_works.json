  "definition": "Account reconciliation is the process that makes sure financial records match external financial statements such as bank statements, invoices, or credit card bills. It helps verify that recorded financial transactions are accurate. Account reconciliations play a part in internal auditing and external auditing, where financial balances are verified as part of validating published financial reports.\n\nAccount reconciliation involves reviewing and comparing your recorded transactions against external financial documents likebank statementsand receipts to confirm their accuracy. The goal is to ensure that no discrepancies exist that could lead to financial mismanagement.\n\nThe process helps individuals avoidoverdraftfees, spot incorrect charges, and more, while businesses can use it to maintain accurate financial records, comply with regulations, and uncover fraud.\n\nBy regularly following these steps, businesses and individuals can confirm that their financial statements accurately represent their financial profile.\n\nAccount reconciliation serves a variety of purposes and can be done across many different types of financial accounts. Here are a few areas where account reconciliation is most applicable:\n\nAccount reconciliation is more important than just ensuring the numbers on statements are correct; it's aboutfinancial health. For individuals, regularly reconciling accounts can help prevent overspending, help track expenses, and avoid unnecessary fees and credit card debt.\n\nIf you've ever been surprised by a low bank balance and not understood why, reconciliation can help you see where your money is going.\n\nFor businesses, account reconciliation is necessary for financial stability. It helps track revenues and expenses accurately, ensuring that profits aren't overestimated and costs aren't underestimated. Regular reconciliation also preventscash flowissues, tax errors, and potential legal troubles.\n\nIn addition, the reconciliation process acts as a safeguard against fraud, dishonest employees, and unauthorized transactions.\n\nHere's a hypothetical example to show how account reconciliation works. Let's say during Company ABC's quarterly account reconciliation process, it notices a discrepancy between its ledger balance of $10,500 and the bank statement showing $10,200. Upon review, ABC finds:\n\nAfter ABC adjusts for these differences, the updatedledgermatches the bank's statement:\n\n$10,500 (ledger balance) - $500 (outstanding check) - $100 (bank service fee) + $300 (customer deposit) = $10,200 (bank balance).\n\nWhether you manage a business or your finances, account reconciliation can help keep your financial health in check. By regularly reviewing and verifying your records, you can catch errors, prevent fraud, and ensure your finances are accurate.",
