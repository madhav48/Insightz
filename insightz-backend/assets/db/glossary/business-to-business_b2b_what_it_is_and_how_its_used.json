  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nBusiness-to-business (B2B), also called B-to-B, is a form\u00a0of transaction between businesses such as a manufacturer and wholesaler or a wholesaler and a retailer. Business-to-business refers to commerce that's conducted between companies rather than companies and individual consumers.\n\nBusiness-to-business stands in contrast tobusiness-to-consumer(B2C) andbusiness-to-government(B2G) transactions.\n\nBusiness-to-business transactions are common in a\u00a0typicalsupply chainbecause companies must typically purchase components andraw materialsfor use in their manufacturing processes. Finished products can then be sold to individuals via business-to-consumer transactions.\n\nIn the context of communication, business-to-business refers to methods by which employees from different companies can connect through outlets such associal media. This type of communication between the employees of two or more companies is called B2B communication.\n\nGrand View Research has reported that the B2Be-commercemarket was estimated at $18,665.5 billion in 2023 and that it's expected to grow at a rate of about 18.2% annually from 2024 through 2030. It attributes the growth to rapid technology improvements.\n\nThe Internet provides a robust environment in which businesses can find out about products and services and lay the groundwork for future business-to-business transactions.\n\nCompany websites allow interested parties to learn about a business's products and services and to initiate contact. Online product and supply exchange websites allow businesses to search for products and services and initiate procurement through e-procurement interfaces. Specialized online directories provide information about particular industries and companies and the products and services they provide. This also facilitates B2B\u00a0transactions.\n\nSuccessful business-to-business transactions require planning. They rely on a company\u2019s account management personnel to establish business-client relationships. Business-to-business relationships must also be nurtured for successful transactions to take place, typically through professional interactions before sales.\n\nTraditional marketing practices also help businesses connect with business clients. Trade publications aid in this effort, offering opportunities to advertise in print and online. A business\u2019s presence at conferences and trade shows also builds awareness of its products and the services it provides to other businesses.\n\nB2B businesses often face longer sales cycles compared to their B2C counterparts. Because purchases typically involve higher stakes, multiple stakeholders, and formal decision-making processes, closing a deal can take weeks or even months. This may make it harder to predict futurecashflowor project revenue for long-term planning.\n\nAnother significant challenge is customer dependence. If B2B companies generate the bulk of their revenue from a small number of large clients, they face more concentrated risk in their operations. Should that other business go under, their overreliance on making money from that one customer could be a problem.\n\nComplex service delivery is also common in B2B settings, particularly when products or solutions need to be customized for each client. Tailoring offerings requires additional coordination between sales, product, and support teams, which can slow operations and inflate costs. For instance, consider aSaaS productfrom Salesforce that has \"out of the box\" characteristics that a business will want to further customize to meet their needs. All of this complicates the product offering cycle.\n\nBusiness-to-business transactions and large corporate accounts are commonplace for firms in\u00a0manufacturing. Samsung is one of Apple's largest suppliers in the production of the iPhone. Apple also holds B2B relationships with firms like Intel, Panasonic, and semiconductor producer Micron Technology as of fiscal year 2022.\n\nB2B transactions are also the backbone of the automobile industry. Many vehicle components are manufactured independently and auto manufacturers purchase these parts to assemble automobiles. Tires, batteries, electronics, hoses, and door locks are typically manufactured by various companies and sold directly to automobile manufacturers.\n\nService providers also engage in B2B\u00a0transactions. Companies specializing in property management, housekeeping, and industrial cleanup often sell these services exclusively to other businesses rather than to individual consumers.\n\nOne of the main differences between B2B and B2C lies in the target audience and decision-making process. B2B businesses sell products to other companies, and that formalprocurementprocedure might be more bureaucratic and slower. In contrast, B2C businesses market directly to individual consumers, who typically make purchasing decisions based on personal preferences, price, and convenience. As a result, B2C sales may be quicker (though smaller).\n\nAnother key distinction is in the sales cycle and relationship building. B2B transactions generally have longer sales cycles due to the complexity and cost of the purchase. On the other hand, B2C sales are usually faster and more transactional, with a primary focus on attracting new customers through compelling branding, promotions, and user-friendly purchasing experiences.\n\nFinally, pricing and product complexity often vary. B2B pricing is typically customized based on volume, contract terms, and service level, and often requiresnegotiation. The products or services themselves can be complex, needing onboarding, training, or technical support. Generally speaking, B2C pricing is more often fixed and transparent, designed for mass consumption, and supported by self-service or light-touch customer support. Consider how you can't go to a grocery store and negotiate the price, yet that grocery store might be able to negotiate rates with some of its suppliers.\n\nE-commerce includes all transactions that are accomplished from start to finish on the Internet. Products and services are purchased online and payments for products and services are also transmitted electronically. But this doesn't mean that a company can't also engage in brick-and-mortar transactions with customers or clients.\n\nA retailer who purchases merchandise from manufacturers for resale to consumers has engaged in a B2B purchase but the purchases don't necessarily have to be resold. They can include software that's used for business purposes or shared business or office spaces.\n\nA B2G transaction involves selling information, services, or products to a government. These are generally E-commerce exchanges but they're not limited to online activity. They're typically entered into under contract. A business submits bids and the government selects one of those bids and takes it to contract.\n\nB2B transactions usually occur between wholesalers and retailers. A wholesaler will sell products to a retailer and that retailer then places price tags on them and offers them to consumers for a profit. They can also involve a manufacturer purchasing necessary raw materials from a supplier to create a product that can eventually be sold to consumers. In any case, the cost generally trickles down to consumers.\n\nGrand View Research. \"Business-to-Business E-commerce Market Size Report, 2030.\"",
