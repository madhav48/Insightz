  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nThe term tier 2 capital refers to one of the components of a bank's required reserves. Tier 2 is designated as the second or supplementary layer of a bank's capital and is composed of items such as revaluation reserves, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt. It is considered less secure thanTier 1 capital\u2014the other form of a bank's capital\u2014because it's more difficult toliquidate. In the United States, the overall capital requirement is partially based on the weighted risk of a bank's assets.\n\nBank capital requirements were designated as part of the internationalBasel Accords. This set of recommendations was developed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision over a number of years dating back to the 1980s. According to the regulations, banks must maintain a certain amount of cash and/or other forms ofliquid assetson hand in order to meet their obligations. No more than 25% of a bank's capital requirements can be comprised of Tier 2 capital.\n\nBank capital is divided into two layers\u2014Tier 1 or core capital and Tier 2 or supplementary capital. A bank's capital ratio is calculated by dividing its capital by its total risk-basedassets. The minimum capital ratioreserve requirementfor a bank is set at 8%\u20146% of which must be provided by Tier 1 capital. The remaining must be Tier 2 capital. Along with Tier 1 capital, it provides a bank with a financial cushion in case it needs to liquidate its assets.\n\nThere are four components of Tier 2 capital. These include:\n\nTier 2 capital is split into upper and lower levels. Upper-level Tier 2 capital consists of securities that are perpetual\u2014meaning they have nomaturity date\u2014revaluation reserves, and fixed asset investments. Lower-level Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated debt and is generally inexpensive for a bank to issue.\n\nUndisclosed reservesmay be counted as part of a bank's Tier 2 capital in certain countries. These reserves are profits a bank earns that don't appear on publicly-available documents such as a bank'sbalance sheet. Despite not being disclosed, most banks still consider these reserves to be real assets.\n\nRegulatory authorities in some countries recognize their banks' undisclosed reserves as part of Tier 2 capital. Most countries, including the United States, do not allow this kind of capital to be used to legitimately meet reserve requirements.\n\nMost countries, including the United States, do not allow undisclosed reserves to be used to meet reserve requirements.\ufeff\ufeff\n\nAs mentioned above, a bank's capital reserves are divided into tiers. UnlikeTier 2 capital, Tier 1 capitalis a bank's core capital or the primary source of funding for a bank. As such, it consists of almost all of an institution's funds including all of its disclosed reserves and any equity capital likecommon stock. This capital helps a bank absorb any losses so it can continue its day-to-day operations. Because this level is composed of a bank's core capital, Tier 1 is a very good indicator of its financial health. This tier is considered more reliable than Tier 2 capital. That's because the capital is much easier to calculate accurately. The assets that fall into this category are also much easier to liquidate.\n\nTier 3 capitalis tertiary capital banks use to support market risk in their trading activities. Tier 3 capital includes a greater variety of debt (short-term unsecured, subordinated debt) than tier 1 and tier 2 capital, but it's of lower quality. Tier 3 capital is being abolished under the Basel III accords.\n\nBasel IIis the second of the three Basel Accords, aimed to create international standards for bank regulation and reduce risk in the banking system. It built upon Basel I, clarifying some of its rules and adding new ones. Basel II led to Basel III, which aims to address the inadequacies of the two earlier accords.\n\nUnder Basell II, banks are required to maintain a capital reserve (Tier 1 + 2 + 3) equal to at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets.\n\nBanking regulations known as the Basel Accords require banks to hold different types of capital on hand and certain percentages of each. Having these types of liquid assets or cash balances out the risk-weighted assets that banks hold and increases the stability of the financial system.\n\nTier 2 capital is the supplementary capital held in reserve by a bank. It is less reliable than tier 1 capital because it's composed of assets that are difficult to liquidate, and it's more difficult to measure accurately.\n\nFederal Reserve. \"Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Tier 1/Tier 2 Framework.\"\n\nFederal Reserve. \"Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule to Help Ensure Banks Maintain Strong Capital Positions.\"\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards,\" Pages 4-5.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards,\" Page 19.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards,\" Pages 6-7.\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards,\" Page 17.\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. \"What Is Bank Capital and What Are the Levels or Tiers of Capital?\"\n\nBank for International Settlements. \"Part 2: The First Pillar \u2013 Minimum Capital Requirements,\" Page 14.\n\nCongressional Research Service. \u201cBank Capital Requirements: A Primer and Policy Issues.\u201d\n\nBank for International Settlements. \u201cBasel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: a Revised Framework.\u201d",
