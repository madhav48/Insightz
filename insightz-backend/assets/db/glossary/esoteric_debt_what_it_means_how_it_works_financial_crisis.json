  "term": "Esoteric Debt: What it Means, How it Works, Financial Crisis",
  "definition": "Esoteric debt refers to debt instruments as well as other investments (called esoteric assets) that are structured in a way that few people fully understand. Esoteric debt is complex and can be a product ofsecuritization,\u00a0or simply\u00a0arise through a complex financing arrangement. As such, the pricing\u00a0of these securities can be contested or seem to be known to relatively few market participants. Moreover, the structure of these instruments may lead to deceptively attractive risk/return profiles over other investments when the instruments function properly, but can also lead toilliquidityand pricing problems when markets are disrupted.\n\nEsoteric debt can refer to a range of debt investments. Some are based off collateral that isn't a traditional base from\u00a0which to offer bonds or other debt securities,\u00a0including things like patents, fees, licensing agreements, and so on.\u00a0Others offer complex payment terms to the issuing company.Pay-in-kindtoggle notes, for example, are\u00a0debt securities\u00a0that allow\u00a0a company to toggle between two options\u2014one is to make the interest payment, the other is to take on extra debt owing to the security holder. These investments come with higher risks\u00a0and, therefore, offer higher yields than regular bonds or even junk bonds. They also come with the extra issues of liquidity, as the market for complex instruments is thin at the best of times and can completely vanish during periods of uncertainty.\n\nA common type of esoteric debt are pass-through securities: pools of individual\u00a0fixed-income securities\u00a0that are in turn backed by a package ofassets. A servicing intermediary collects the monthly payments from issuers and, after deducting a fee, remits or passes them through to the holders of the pass-through security.Mortgage-backed securities(MBS) are a common example of pass-through securities. They\u00a0derive their value from unpaid mortgages, in which the owner of the security receives payments based on a partial claim to the payments being made by the various debtors. Multiple mortgages are packaged together, forming a pool, which thus spreads the risk across multiple loans. However, some mortgage owners are likely to refinance their home or sell, meaning that their loans will be paid off early. Others may default on their loan. These unknowns lead to esoteric pricing models that can vary among and between counterparties in this market.\n\nAuction rate securitiesare another example of an esoteric debt vehicle that has been effectively shut down since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe Financial Crisis of 2008\u20132009 introduced the global economy to some of the risks inherent in having too much esoteric debt and too many esoteric investments in general. During this time, credit was flowing so freely that many companies and third-party issuers\u00a0were creating innovative and imaginative debt vehicles tailored to whatever a particular investor wanted. The primary driver, of course, was\u00a0to make a lot of money in fees and meet the financing needs of some desperate companies\u00a0rather than as a favor to investors.\n\nWhen the credit market seized up as companies struggled to accurately value their holdings of mortgage-backed securities andcredit default swaps, the oddball esoteric debt was considered too complex to even bother with. So, while there was a slow and painful process that eventually led to the troubled MBS\u00a0being priced and then moved, the market for esoteric debt froze entirely. Without accurate pricing information, there were few buyers to help investors move esoteric debt off their balance sheets. This took down the auction rate securities market, which was once perceived as being slightly more risky than the money market. The SEC stepped in on that particular file to force settlements over improper disclosure of risk, but not all forms of esoteric debt received the same treatment.\n\nInterestingly enough, esoteric debt began reappearing shortly after the Financial Crisis transitioned to the Great Recession. Starved for yield, investors were once again willing to take on complexity and liquidity risk for a better return.\u00a0While these complicated instruments may be more attractive thanplain vanilladebt in good times, they can present immense problems when the credit markets tighten.",
