  "definition": "Katrina \u00c1vila Munichiello is an experienced editor, writer, fact-checker, and proofreader with more than fourteen years of experience working with print and online publications.\n\nA green bond is a fixed-income debt instrument earmarked to raise money for climate and environmental projects. It\u2019s typically asset-linked and backed by the issuing entity\u2019s balance sheet, so it usually carries the same credit rating as its issuers\u2019 other debt obligations.\u200b\n\nAs the world increasingly focuses on addressing climate change and other environmental challenges, green bonds have become popular for investors to align their financial goals with their values and contribute to positive change. Green bonds are a type of fixed-income investment used to fund projects with a positive environmental impact. Like traditional bonds, green bonds offer investors a stated return and a promise to use the proceeds to finance or refinance sustainable projects, either in part or whole.\n\nThese bonds are issued by public, private, or multilateral entities to raise capital for initiatives that contribute to a more sustainable economy and generate identifiable climate, environmental, or other benefits. Projects funded by green bonds include renewable energy, energy efficiency, clean public transportation, pollution prevention and control, conservation, sustainable water and wastewater management, and green buildings that meet internationally recognized standards and certifications.\n\nGreen bonds are meant to encourage sustainability and support climate-related or other environmental projects. They help finance projects ranging from energy efficiency to sustainable agriculture and forestry to protecting aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. They also finance the cultivation of environmentally friendly technologies and climate change mitigation.\n\nLike other bonds, the green variety often has tax incentives in the form of credits and exemptions, making them more attractive than comparabletaxable bonds.\n\nGreen bonds are often verified by a third party, such as the Climate Bonds Standard Board, which certifies that the bond will fund projects that provide environmental benefits.\n\nAs recently as 2012, the value of all green bonds issued was just $2.6 billion. But in recent years, the market has boomed as governments introduce new requirements to tackle climate change, and many investors want investments that meet their ESG goals.\n\nBloomberg reports that sales of green bonds climbed to a record $575 billion in 2023. Of that total, $190 billion of green bonds were issued by governments during the year.\n\nDemand is expected to increase in the coming years, thanks to cheaper borrowing costs made possible by the expectation of falling interest rates and European regulations to improve the transparency, comparability, and credibility of the green bond market.\n\nGreen bond funds developed in the 2010s, broadening the ability of retail investors to participate in these initiatives. Allianz SE. (ALV.DE), Axa S.A., State Street Corporation (STT), TIAA-CREF, BlackRock Inc. (BLK), AXA World Funds, and HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBC) are among the investment companies and asset management firms that have sponsored green bondmutual fundsor exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n\nThe year when the World Bank issued the first so-labeled green bond for institutional investors.\n\nThe World Bankis a major issuer of green bonds. In 2022, the last year for which data is available, it reported $40.8 billion in bonds issued, $28.2 billion in funds disbursed, and $33.1 billion in new lending committed. Previously, the bank had reported issuing $14.4 billion in green bonds from 2008 through 2020.The funds went to projects for energy and efficiency (33%), clean transportation (27%), and agriculture and land use (15%).\n\nOne of the bank\u2019s first green bond sales financed the Rampur Hydropower Project, which provided low-carbon hydroelectric power to northern India\u2019s electricity grid. Financed by issuances of green bonds, it produces almost 2 megawatts per year, preventing 1.4 million tons of carbon emissions.In 2022, its combined projects lowered carbon emissions by 8.4 million tons.\n\nWhile all green bonds represent a form of debt financing for an environmental project, the specific characteristics of each instrument may differ based on its issuer, what the proceeds are used for, and the recourse of bondholders to the issuer\u2019s assets in case of a liquidation, among other factors. The following are types of green bonds available on the market:\n\nInvestments in green bonds often come from institutional investors, mutual funds, hedge funds, and endowments that can afford to invest large sums in debt instruments. However, many mutual funds and ETFs offer exposure to the green bond space for retail investors who want to align their portfolios with their environmental sensibilities and values.\n\nFor example, the iShares USD Green Bond ETF (BGRN) tracks the performance of an index comprisinginvestment-gradebonds that finance environmental projects. While the ETF focuses only on U.S. dollar-denominated debt, it includes bonds from non-U.S. issuers and U.S.-based borrowers.\n\nWhile ETFs like BGRN are readily available through a brokerage account or online platform, retail investors who want to buy individual green bonds have a slightly more complex situation. Your broker may allow you to invest in individual bonds, but when purchasing green bonds from corporate issuers, you may be subject to minimum deposits, maintenance fees, and commissions. Government-issued green bonds may also be available to buy through your broker or directly from the issuer.\n\nWhen buying green bonds, you might have several challenges. Transparency and reporting can create a bit of homework, as you'll want detailed information about the use of proceeds and the environmental impact of funded projects.Also, the green bond market is still developing, and some bonds may have lowerliquiditythan traditional ones, making it harder to buy or sell at desired prices and times. The lack of a universal standard in the green bond market can create confusion about what qualifies as a green bond, and there are no binding regulations for the nongovernmental standards often used.\n\nBlue bonds are sustainability bonds used to finance projects that protect the ocean and related ecosystems. They might support sustainable fisheries, protection of coral reefs and other fragile ecosystems, or reducing pollution and acidification. All blue bonds are green bonds, but not all green bonds are blue bonds.\n\n\u201cGreen bonds\u201d and \u201cclimate bonds\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably, but some authorities use the latter term specifically for projects focusing on reducing carbon emissions or alleviating the effects ofclimate change. The Climate Bonds Initiative has set standards for certifying climate bonds.\n\nDespite efforts like those of the Climate Bonds Initiative, there is no universally recognized standard for determining the environmental friendliness of a bond. Sometimes, debt instruments may be marketed to investors as \u201cgreen\u201d even if their positive environmental impact is dubious at best.Examples ofgreenwashing\u2014making exaggerated or misleading ecological claims\u2014highlight the need for investors to carry out due diligence regarding potential green bond purchases. In addition to the Climate Bonds Initiative, other companies provide assessments of bond issuers\u2019 environmental claims, including Bloomberg L.P., rating agencies such as Moody\u2019s, and other specialized firms.\n\nGreen bonds are debt securities designed to finance environmentally friendly projects. Green bonds may offer tax advantages, providing incentives for investing in sustainable projects that do not apply to comparable types of bonds. Investors seeking assets that align with their environmental values should be sure to verify the claims of sustainability made by bond issuers.\n\nMunicipal Securities Rulemaking Board. \"About Green Bonds.\"\n\nRaj M.
