  "definition": "Julia Kagan is a financial/consumer journalist and former senior editor, personal finance, of Investopedia.\n\nAn itemized deduction is an expense that can be subtracted from youradjusted gross income (AGI)to reduce your taxable income and lower the amount of taxes you owe. Taxpayers can itemize deductions likemortgage interest, charitable gifts, and unreimbursed medical expenses, or choose to take thestandard deduction, a fixed dollar amount that varies by filing status.\n\nItemized deductions reduce yourtaxable income, and your savings depend on yourtax bracket. Suppose an unmarried single filer with agross incomeof $80,000 claims itemized deductions totaling $15,000. Subtracting those deductions from gross income yields a taxable income of $65,000, which falls within a 22% marginal tax rate bracket for 2024 and 2025.\n\nItemized deductions are recorded onSchedule AofForm 1040.Taxpayers must save all receipts and documentation of expenses reported in case the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requests them in an audit. Additional proof can include bank statements, insurance bills, medical bills, and tax receipts from qualified charitable organizations.\n\nTax deductionsshould not be confused withtax credits, which directly reduce your tax bill. If you calculate your taxes due as $14,000 and are eligible for a $1,000 tax credit, your bill is cut by $1,000 to $13,000.\n\nThe majority of taxpayers have the option to itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction.Nonresident aliensmust itemize, andmarried individuals who are filing separatelyeach must claim the same type of deduction.\n\nThe decision depends on which deduction type garners the lowesttax liability. If you file as a single taxpayer or are married and filing separately, you will fare better with the standard deduction of $14,600 for 2024 and $15,000 for 2025 if your itemized deductions total less than that amount.\n\nThe list of expenses that can be itemized is extensive and can include some medical expenses, mortgage interest, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes. You canview the liston the IRS website. Taxpayers use Schedule A, part of IRS Form 1040, to calculate and list deductions.\n\nSchedule A can be downloaded from theIRS website.\n\nYou can deduct mortgage interest on a loan of $750,000 or less for a home bought on or after Dec. 16, 2017, and charitable donations of up to 60% of your AGI but it depends on the type of contribution and the charity.\n\nYou can also deduct qualified, unreimbursed medical and dental expenses over 7.5% of AGI; state and local income or sales taxes plus real estate and personal property taxes up to $10,000 or $5,000 if married filing separately,gambling losses, and investment interest less than investment income.\n\nMortgage interest on the first $750,000 of indebtedness\u2014or $1 million, if you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017\n\nCharitable contributions up to 60% of AGI\n\nMedical and dental expenses over 7.5% of AGI\n\nState and local income, plus either personal property or sales taxes up to IRS threshold\n\nGambling losses up to total amount won\n\nMortgage interest on loan amounts over $750,000, unless you bought your home before Dec. 16, 2017\n\nState and local income, sales, and personal property taxes beyond IRS threshold\n\nNatural disaster losses unless in a federally declared disaster area\n\nWhen you file your income tax return, you can take the standard deduction, a fixed dollar amount based on your filing status, or you can itemize your deductions. Unlike the standard deduction, the dollar amount of itemized deductions will vary by taxpayer, depending on the expenses on Schedule A of Form 1040. The amount is subtracted from the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income.\n\nYou itemize your deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040. You cangenerally deductunreimbursed medical and dental expenses, long-term care premiums, home mortgage interest, charitable donations, certain taxes, casualty and theft losses, and some gambling losses.\n\nYou have the option to take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions. If the value of expenses you can itemize is greater than the standard deduction, then it likely makes sense to itemize.\n\nFor single taxpayers and those who are married but filing separately, the standard deduction is $14,600 in 2024 and $15,000 in 2025. For heads of households, the standard deduction is $21,900 in 2024 and $22,500 in 2025. For taxpayers who are married and filing jointly, the standard deduction is $29,200 in 2024 and $30,000 in 2025.\n\nAn itemized deduction is an expense that can be subtracted from your adjusted gross income (AGI) to reduce your tax bill. Taxpayers can itemize deductions or claim the standard deduction that applies to their filing status. Itemized deductions must be listed on Schedule A of Form 1040 and may include mortgage interest, charitable gifts, and unreimbursed medical expenses.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2024.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cIRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2025.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cAbout Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 305, Recordkeeping.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cCredits and Deductions for Individuals.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 501, Should I Itemize?\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Schedule A (Form 1040), Itemized Deductions.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction,\" Page 1.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Publication 526, Charitable Contributions,\" Pages 14-15.\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 505, Interest Expense.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Topic No. 419, Gambling Income and Losses.\"\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 502, Medical and Dental Expenses.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \u201cTopic No. 503, Deductible Taxes.\u201d\n\nInternal Revenue Service. \"Tax Basics: Understanding the Difference Between Standard and Itemized Deductions.\"",
