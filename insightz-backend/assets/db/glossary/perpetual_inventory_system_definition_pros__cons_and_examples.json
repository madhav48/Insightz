  "definition": "A perpetual inventory system is a computerized system that continuously records inventory changes in real-time, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for physical inventory checks. Relying on data provided by electronic point-of-sale technology, it provides a highly detailed view of changes ininventoryand immediate reporting on the amount of inventory in stock. Perpetual inventory systems differ fromperiodic inventory systems, in which a company must instead depend on regularly scheduled physical counts.\n\nPerpetual inventory systems may be preferable to older periodic inventory systems because they allow for immediate tracking of sales and inventory levels for individual items, which helps to prevent running out of stock.\n\nA perpetual inventory does not need to be adjusted manually by the company's accountants, except to the extent that it deviates from the physical inventory count due to loss, breakage, or theft.\n\nSystem softwareprovides real-time updates to inventory through the use of barcode scanners or other computerized records of product acquisition, sales, and returns as they occur. This information is fed into a continually adjusted perpetual database.\n\nThe system allows for integration with other areas, including finance and accounting teams. This helps ensure adherence to tax and other regulations. Employees can use perpetual inventory data to provide more accurate customer service regarding the availability of products, replacement parts, and other physical components.\n\nBecause perpetual inventory systems lack the ability to account for loss, breakage, or theft, a periodic (physical) inventory can still be necessary.\n\nThe differences betweenperpetual and periodic inventory systemsgo beyond how the two systems function, although that is the main point of distinction.\n\nPerpetual inventory systems track sales constantly and immediately with computerized point-of-sale technology. Periodic inventory systems only track sales when a physical count is ordered and require a point-in-time count.\n\nLarge companies or those with complex inventories are well suited to a perpetual system. Smaller companies with limited inventory can often survive with a periodic system. The same applies to the margin for error, which is lower with a perpetual system, although a limited, uncomplicated inventory may not suffer much with a periodic system.\n\nThecost of goods sold (COGS)is an important accounting metric derived by adding the beginning balance of inventory to the cost of inventory purchases and subtracting the cost of the ending inventory. With a perpetual inventory system, COGS is updated constantly instead of periodically with the alternative physical inventory.\n\nOverall, once a perpetual inventory system is in place, it takes less effort than a physical system. However, the startup costs for a perpetual inventory system are greater.\n\nProponents of perpetual inventory systems don't always go out of their way to point out the downsides of these systems, the chief of which is the lack of accounting for loss, breakage, or theft.\n\nOn the other hand, detractors don't necessarily note that reported stockouts without corresponding sales can signal theft or loss and trigger a physical inventory check faster than with a periodic system.\n\nWhen deciding how to maintain control over physical inventory, it's prudent to carefully weigh both the pros and cons of any system under consideration.\n\nLarge companies with a high volume of constantly rotating physical inventory should consider implementing a perpetual inventory system. The same applies to businesses with multiple locations. Companies that don't meet those criteria now but anticipate growth in the future may want to consider such a system, as well.\n\nOther factors that can affect the need for a perpetual inventory system include:\n\nTo calculate inventory, companies need to set up a system where every piece of inventory is entered into the system and deducted from the system as it's sold. This requires the use ofpoint-of-sale terminals, barcode scanners, and perpetual inventory software to update estimated inventory with every product purchase and sale.\n\nSince a perpetual inventory system estimates stock on hand, it does not replace a periodic physical inventory. At some point, a physical inventory should take place.\n\nBusinesses that use a perpetual inventory system typically employ cycle counting or the process of physically counting a portion of inventory to use as a baseline to check the accuracy of the perpetual system. The intent is to complete a full physical inventory over time.\n\nInventory managementrefers to the processes involved in ordering raw materials, storing and using them to create products, and ultimately selling products to an end user. There are four main inventory management methods:\n\nEach of these methods has its pros and cons when it comes to use within a perpetual inventory system.\n\nThe use of a perpetual inventory system makes it particularly easy for a company to use the economic order quantity (EOQ) method to purchase inventory. EOQ is a formula that managers use to decide when to purchase inventory based on the cost to hold inventory as well as the firm's cost to order inventory.\n\nWhen a company sells products in a perpetual inventory system, the expense account increases and grows the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS represents production costs and expenses during a specific period. This includes the materials and labor costs but not distribution or sales expenses. The formula for COGS appears below.\n\nA perpetual inventory system maintains a continuous tally of transactions, making the COGS available at any time. By contrast, a periodic inventory system calculates the COGS only after conducting a physical inventory.\n\nThe advantage of a perpetual system in providing a rolling estimate of COGS is clear. A company knows, after each transaction, how much it costs to produce products sold at that point. By updating these data on a continuous basis and integrating them with other business systems, the company has actionable information available on a 24/7 basis as a way to respond to increased costs in a timely manner.\n\nGross profit is the result of subtracting COGS from revenue. Recall that COGS includes the cost of labor and materials but not sales or distribution costs. The formula for gross profit is:\n\nThe ability to estimate COGS continuously also provides a company using a perpetual inventory system the ability to estimate gross profit continuously. That\u2019s because every transaction is recorded in real-time under a perpetual inventory system.\n\nCompanies can choose among several methods to account for the cost of inventory held for sale, but the total inventory cost expensed is the same using any method. The difference between the methods is the timing of when the inventory cost is recognized, and the cost of inventory sold is posted to the cost of sales expense account.\n\nThefirst in, first out (FIFO)method assumes that the oldest units are sold first, while thelast in, first out (LIFO)method records the newest units as those sold first. Businesses can simplify the inventory costing process by using aweighted average cost, or the total inventory cost divided by the number of units in inventory.\n\nA perpetual inventory system uses point-of-sale terminals, scanners, and software to record all transactions in real-time and maintain an estimate of inventory on a continuous basis. A periodic inventory system requires counting items at various intervals, such as weekly, monthly, quarterly, or annually.\n\nCOGS is an acronym for cost of goods sold. It plays an integral role in business accounting by providing a point-in-time estimate of the cost to produce products sold by a company. If the company utilizes a perpetual inventory system, COGS is available on a continuous basis. With a periodic inventory system, COGS is calculated at the end of an inventory period.\n\nFIFO (first in, first out) refers to an accounting system that assumes the oldest products are sold first, followed by newer ones. LIFO (last in, first out) assumes the most recent products are sold before older ones.\n\nBusinesses increasingly track inventory using a perpetual inventory system versus the older, physical-count periodic inventory system. Perpetual systems are costly to implement but less expensive and time-consuming over the long haul.\n\nDespite the advantages of a continuously updated estimate of stockage and the interconnectivity of accounting systems, a major drawback of perpetual systems is the inability to track lost, damaged, or stolen items. Many companies counter this with periodic partial inventory counts, which provide a baseline for the perpetual system and are designed to provide a full physical inventory by the end of the period.\n\nSmall- and medium-sized companies or those with small physical inventories continue to use the periodic inventory system, though many are opting for low-cost perpetual inventory systems.\n\nLarge companies, companies with multiple locations, and those with large physical inventories have largely converted to perpetual systems since they can absorb the high startup costs and realize savings through the minimal use of labor that comes with a perpetual system.\n\nU.S. General Accounting Office. \"Executive Guide: Best Practices in Achieving Consistent, Accurate Physical Counts of Inventory and Related Property.\" Pages 20-21.",
