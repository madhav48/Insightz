  "term": "Elasticity: What It Means in Economics, Formula, and Examples",
  "definition": "Elasticity is a\u00a0term used in economics\u00a0to describe responsiveness in one variable to changes in another. Typically, elasticity is used to describe how much demand for a product changes as its price increases or decreases. This is also known asdemand\u00a0elasticity.\n\nElasticity for a good or service can vary according to the number\u00a0of close substitutes available, its relative cost, and the amount of time that has elapsed since the price change occurred. The maintypes of elasticityinclude price, income, and cross-product subsitutions.\n\nElasticity is an important economic measure, particularly for the sellers of goods or services, because it indicates how much of a good or service buyers consume when the price changes.\n\nWhen a product is elastic, a change in price quickly results in a change in thequantity demanded. When a good is inelastic, there is little change in\u00a0the quantity of demand even with the change of the good's price. The change that is observed for an elastic good is an increase in demand when the price decreases and a decrease in demand when the price increases.\n\nCompanies that operate in fiercely\u00a0competitive industries provide goods or services that are elastic. This is because these companies tend to beprice-takers, meaning they typically must accept prevailing prices. When the price of a good or service reaches the point of elasticity, sellers and buyers quickly adjust their demand for that good or service.\n\nElasticity also communicates important information to consumers. If the market price of an elastic good decreases, firms are likely to reduce the number of goods or services they are willing to supply. If the market price goes up, firms are likely to increase the number of goods they are willing to sell. This concept is known as elasticity of supply. It is important for consumers who need a product and are concerned with potentialscarcity.\n\nTypically, goods that are elastic are either unnecessary goods or services or those for which\u00a0competitors offer\u00a0readily available substitute goods and services. The airline industry is elastic because it is a competitive industry. If one airline decides to increase the price of its fares, consumers can use another airline, and the airline that increased its fares will see a decrease in the demand for its services. Meanwhile, gasoline is an example of a relatively inelastic good because many consumers have no choice but to buy fuel for their vehicles, regardless of the market price.\n\nWhen a good or service is perfectly elastic, demand for it is extremely sensitive to changes in price. This is the inverse of extreme inelasticity, in which demand is fixed regardless of fluctuations in price.\n\nIn general, demand elasticity refers to change in demand for a product in response to some other variable. Typically, that variable is price. However, there are other types of demand elasticity, as well. One might want to measure demand elasticity in response to income. This would reflect changes in demand for a product based on how incomes fluctuate. Another indicator is demand elasticity in respones to cross-price, which reflects changes in demand based on how prices for competitor products move.\n\nInelastic goods tend to see little change in demand regardless of price fluctuations. Typically, these goods are essentials or necessities that consumers need even if prices rise or incomes fall. Examples may include staples like bread, housing, health care, and gasoline, as mentioned above.\n\nIn general, elasticity refers to the responsiveness of one variable to changes in another. In economics, this most frequently refers to demand elasticity, or how demand fluctuates based on changes in other factors, such as price, income, and more. The opposite of elasticity is inelasticity. When a good or service is inelastic, demand fluctuates very little regardless of changes in other factors.",
