  "term": "Indexing: Definition and Uses in Economics and Investing",
  "definition": "Indexing, broadly, refers to the use of somebenchmarkindicator or measure as a reference or yardstick. In finance and economics, indexing is used as a statistical measure for tracking economic data such as inflation, unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, productivity, and market returns.\n\nIndexing may also refer topassive investmentstrategies that replicate benchmark indexes.Index investinghas become increasingly popular over the past decades.\n\nIndexing is used in the financial market as a statistical measure for tracking economic data. Indexes created by economists provide some of the market\u2019s leading indicators for economic trends. Economic indexes closely followed in the financial markets include thePurchasing Managers' Index (PMI), theInstitute for Supply Management\u2019s Manufacturing Index (ISM), and theComposite Index of Leading Economic Indicators. These indexes are tracked to measure changes over time.\n\nStatistical indexes may also be used as a gauge for linking values. Thecost-of-living adjustment (COLA)is a statistical measure obtained through analysis of theConsumer Price Index (CPI)that indexes prices toinflation.Many pension plans and insurance policies use COLA and the Consumer Price Index as a measure for retirement benefit payout adjustments with the adjustment using inflation-based indexing measures.\n\nAnindexis a method to track the performance of a group of assets in a standardized way. Indexes typically measure the performance of a basket of securities intended to replicate a certain area of the market.\n\nThese could be abroad-based indexthat captures the entire market, such as theStandard & Poor's 500 IndexorDow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Indexes can also be more specialized, such as indexes that track a particular industry or segment. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a price-weighted index, which means it gives greater weight to stocks in the index with a higher price. The S&P 500 Index is a market capitalization-weighted index, which means it gives greater weight to stocks in the S&P 500 Index with a higher market capitalization.\n\nIndex providers have numerous methodologies for constructing investment market indexes. Investors and market participants use these indexes as benchmarks on performance. If a fund manager is underperforming the S&P 500 over the long term, for example, it will be hard to entice investors into the fund.\n\nIndexes also exist that track bond markets, commodities, and derivatives.\n\nIndexing is broadly known in the investment industry as a passive\u00a0investment strategy for gaining targeted exposure to a specified market segment. The majority of active investment managers typically do not consistently beat index benchmarks. Moreover, investing in a targeted segment of the market for capital appreciation or as a long-term investment can be expensive given the trading costs associated with buying individual securities. Therefore, indexing is a popular option for many investors.\n\nAn investor can achieve the same risk and return of a target index by\u00a0investing\u00a0in anindex fund. Most index funds have low expense ratios and work well in a passively managed portfolio.Index funds can be constructed using individual stocks and bonds to replicate the target indexes. They can also be managed as afund of fundswith mutual funds or exchange-traded funds as their base holdings.\n\nMost brokerages will offer index funds that are benchmarked against the major stock market indexes. These can be mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.\n\nSince index investing takes a passive\u00a0approach,\u00a0index funds\u00a0usually have lowermanagement feesand expense ratios (ERs)\u00a0than actively managed funds. The simplicity of tracking the market without a portfolio manager allows providers to maintain modest fees.\u00a0Index funds also tend to be more tax-efficient than active funds because they make less-frequent trades.\n\nMore-complex indexing strategies may seek to replicate the holdings and returns of a customized index. Customized index-tracking funds have evolved as a low-cost investment option for investing in a screened subset of securities. Tracking funds are based on a range of filters, including:\n\nThese tracker funds are essentially trying to take the best of the best within a category of stocks. For example, a fund may pull from the best energy companies within the broader indexes that track the energy industry.\n\nIn investing, indexing is a passive investment strategy. You create a portfolio that tracks a common market index, such as the S&P 500 with the goal of mimicking the index's performance. As a strategy, indexing offers broad diversification, as well as lower expenses, than investing strategies that are actively managed.\n\nA broad market index tracks the performance of a large group of stocks. This large group is chosen to represent the entire stock market. A broad market index adds significant diversification to any portfolio. Examples of broad-based indexes include the S&P 500 Index and the Russell 3000 Index.\n\nIndexing isa good investment strategyfor many people. It creates a diversified portfolio, and it usually requires lower fees and expenses than an actively managed fund. It also mimics the broader stock market, which over the long run will generally perform better than any single person picking stocks.\n\nIndexing refers to compiling economic data into a single metric. It can also mean comparing data to such a metric in order to measure its change or performance. In economics, there are many indexes that summarize or reflect economic and market activity. For example, cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security payments are indexed to inflation.\n\nIn investing, indexes are benchmarks that are used to measure the performance of fund managers and portfolios. It can also refer to a passive investing strategy that aims to mimic broad market returns rather than picking individual stocks.\n\nSocial Security Administration. \"Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Information.\"\n\nS&P Dow Jones Indices. \"Icons: The S&P 500 and The Dow.\"\n\nInvestment Company Institute. \"Trends in the Expenses and Fees of Funds, 2022,\" Page 12.",
