VCTs seek out potential venture capital investments in small unlisted firms that are in their early stages to generate higher-than-average, risk-adjusted returns. VCTs are commonly listed on theLondon Stock Exchange(LSE).\n\nThe British government introduced a series of venture capital schemes in 1995. These include theenterprise investment scheme, seed enterprise investment scheme, and venture capital trust scheme.

Shares can also be purchased on thesecondary marketon public exchanges in the United Kingdom, such as the LSE.\n\nFund managers usually charge fees that are higher than other investments.
