  "definition": "Whipsaw describes the movement of asecuritywhen, at a particular time, the security's price is moving in one direction but then quickly pivots to move in\u00a0the opposite direction.\n\nThere are two types of whipsaw patterns. The first involves\u00a0an upward movement in a share price, which is then followed by a drastic downward move\u00a0causing the share's price to fall relative to its original position. The second type occurs when a share price drops in value for a short time\u00a0and then suddenly surges upward to\u00a0a positive gain\u00a0relative to the stock's original position.\n\nThe origin of the term whipsaw is derived\u00a0from the push and pull action of\u00a0lumberjacks when\u00a0cutting\u00a0wood with a saw of the same name. A trader is considered to be \"whipsawed\" when the price of a security they have just invested in abruptly moves in the opposite and unexpected\u00a0direction.\n\nWhipsaw patterns most notably occur in avolatilemarket\u00a0in which price fluctuations are unpredictable.Day tradersor other short-term investors are accustomed to being whipsawed. Those who have a long-term,buy and holdapproach to investing can\u00a0often ride out the volatility of the market and emerge with positive gains.\n\nFor example, when an investor goeslongon a stock, the expectation is that\u00a0the price\u00a0will increase in value over time. However, there are many occasions when\u00a0an investor purchases shares of a company at the top of a market rally. The investor buys a stock at its peak\u00a0assuming that it will continue to post significant\u00a0gains. Almost immediately after purchasing the stock, the company releases\u00a0aquarterly reportthat shakes investor confidence and causes the stock to decline in value by more than 10%, never to recover. The investor is holding the stock at a loss, with no option to sell the stock, effectively whipsawed.\n\nConversely, some investors, specifically those whoshort sell, can face a whipsaw at the bottom of a market. For example, an investor may anticipate a downturn in the economy and purchase\u00a0put options on the S&P 500. The investor profits if the market continues to decline. However, almost immediately after purchasing theput options, the market unexpectedlyrallies, and the investor's\u00a0options quickly become \"out of the money,\" or worthless. In this case, the whipsaw occurs during a recovery phase, and the investor loses the investment.\n\nFinancial markets change abruptly. Manyanalysts seek models that explain patternsin the markets so that an investor can select the right asset classes. A study by Sonam Srivastava and Ritabrata Bhattacharyya, titled, \"Evaluating the Building Blocks of a Dynamically Adaptive Systematic Trading Strategy,\" explains that stockpatterns vary because of fundamental changes in macroeconomic variables, policies, or regulations.\n\nThe authors state that a trader needs to adapt their trading style to leverage the different phases in the stock markets. They also suggest that investors select asset classes in different market regimes to ensure a stable risk-adjusted return profile.However, different experts will offer different advice.\n\nA whipsaw references any price movement that is in the opposite direction of a trader's intended bet, often resulting in a loss, or if they are able, to ride out the fluctuations in price to maintain the investment and even realize a profit.\n\nStocks have whipsawed recently due to uncertainty about the future of the economy, rising inflation, and geopolitical unrest.\n\nTo weather the volatility, experts recommend that investors stick to a long-term strategy that plays to their strengths and follow that strategy regardless of whipsaw movements. In terms of investment, another expert recommended investing in more stable sectors such as healthcare and avoiding more volatile sectors such as real estate. Most experts were expecting significant volatility in the short term, and one recommended assuming a defensive position. However, they did also state that a long-term portfolio based on the stock would win out.\n\nWhile it may look like a sideways market, whipsaws imply that there are large up and down swings within a certain trading band. This can be profitable forswing traderswho can catch momentum both up and down as the market oscillates. Buyinglong straddlesin the options market is another strategy that can profit as prices move both up and down.\n\nWhipsaws can cause losses for traders by triggering closing trades, only to be reversed in short order. Traders are oftenstopped outwhen a market\u00a0whipsaws, or moves sharply in one direction before returning to its original state. For example, a stock may whipsaw during an earnings announcement or other market moving event. This can execute stop-loss orders that close out positions, even as the stock subsequently rebounds.\n\nCertain technical indicators are useful in identifying a whipsawing market.Envelopes, momentum indicators,parabolic SAR, and thevortex indicator are some good examples.\n\nWorldQuant University. \"Evaluating the Building Blocks of a Dynamically Adaptive Systematic Trading Strategy,\" Page 1.\n\nCNBC. \"Stocks Whipsawed in a Rollercoaster Trading Session \u2014\u00a0Here\u2019s What Three Experts Say Investors Can Do Next.\"",
