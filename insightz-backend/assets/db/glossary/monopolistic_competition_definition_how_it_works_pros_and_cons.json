  "term": "Monopolistic Competition: Definition, How It Works, Pros and Cons",
  "definition": "Monopolistic competition is a market structure in which companies compete against each other by offering products or services that are only slightly different. As a result, no single product or service dominates the market.\n\nMonopolistic competition exists when many companies offer competing products or services that are similar but not perfect substitutes. Thebarriers to entryin a monopolistically competitive industry are low and the decisions of any one firm don't directly affect its competitors. Competing companies differentiate themselves based on pricing and marketing decisions.\n\nMonopolistic competition exists along the spectrum between a completemonopolyandperfect competition. It combines elements of each.\n\nDemand is highly elastic for goods and services of the competing companies and pricing is often a key strategy for these competitors. One company might opt to lower prices and sacrifice a higherprofit margin, hoping for increased sales. Another might raise its price and use packaging or marketing that suggests better quality or sophistication.\n\nCompanies often use distinct marketing strategies andbrandingto distinguish their products. The products may all serve the same purpose so the average consumer often doesn't know the precise differences between the various products or how to determine what a fair price may be.\n\nHousehold items provide an example of monopolistic competition. Items like dish soap or hamburgers are sold, marketed, and priced by many competing companies.\n\nMonopolistic competition can take many shapes and have varying results and benefits.\n\nA single firm doesn't monopolize the market in monopolistic competition. Multiple companies can enter the market and all can compete for market share. Companies don't have to consider how their decisions influence competitors, and each firm can operate without fear of increasing competition.\n\nCompeting companies differentiate their similar products with distinct marketing strategies, brand names, and different quality levels.\n\nCompanies in monopolistic competition act as price makers and set prices for goods and services. Firms can raise or lower prices without inciting a price war often found inoligopolies.\n\nDemand ishighly elasticin monopolistic competition and very responsive to price changes. Consumers will change from one brand name to another for items like laundry detergent based solely on price increases.\n\nMonopolistic competition provides both benefits and pitfalls for companies and consumers.\n\nFew barriers to entry for new companies\n\nVariety of choices for consumers\n\nCompany decision-making power for prices and marketing\n\nConsistent quality of product for consumers\n\nHaving many competitors limits access to economies of scale\n\nInefficient company spending on marketing, packaging, and advertising\n\nToo many choices for consumers means extra research required\n\nMisleading advertising or imperfect information for consumers\n\nThe product offered by competitors is the same item in perfect competition. A company will lose all its market share to the other companies based on market supply and demand forces if it increases its price.\n\nSupply and demand forces don't dictate pricing in monopolistic competition. Firms are selling similar but distinct products so they determine the pricing. Product differentiation is the key feature of monopolistic competition because products are marketed by quality or brand. Demand is highly elastic and any change in pricing can cause demand to shift from one competitor to another.\n\nCompanies aim to produce a quantity wheremarginal revenueequals marginal cost to maximize profit or minimize loss. New firms will enter the market when existing firms are making a profit.\n\nThe demand curve and the marginal revenue curve then shift. New firms stop entering when all firms are making zero profit in the long run. Some firms will exit the market if existing firms are incurring losses. The firms stop exiting the market after all firms start making zero profit. The market is atequilibriumin the long run only when there's no further exit or entry in the market or when all firms make zero profit in the long run.\n\nMonopolistic competition is present in the fast food industry. Burger King and McDonald's are both fast-food chains that target a similar market and offer similar products and services. These companies actively compete with each other and seek to differentiate themselves through brand recognition, price, and by offering different food and drink packages.\n\nA monopoly occurs when a single company dominates an industry and can set prices for its product without fear of competition. Monopolies limit consumer choices and control production quantity and quality.\n\nMonopolistically competitive companies must compete with others, restricting their ability to substantially raise prices without affecting demand and providing a range of product choices for consumers. Monopolistic competition is more common than monopolies, which are discouraged infree-marketnations.\n\nMonopolistic competition exists when many companies offer competitive products or services that are similar but not exact substitutes. Hair salons and clothing are examples of industries with monopolistic competition. Pricing and marketing are key strategies for competing companies and they often rely on branding or discount pricing strategies to increase market share.\n\nCFI Education. \"Monopolistic Competition.\"\n\nEconomicsOnline. \"Monopolistic Competition.\"\n\nLibrary of Economics and Liberty. \"Monopoly.\"",
