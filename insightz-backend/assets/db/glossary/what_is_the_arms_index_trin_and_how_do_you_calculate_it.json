  "definition": "Suzanne is a content marketer, writer, and fact-checker.\u00a0She holds a Bachelor of Science in Finance degree from Bridgewater State University and helps develop content strategies.\n\nThe Arms index, also called the short-term trading index (TRIN) is a technical analysis indicator that compares the number of advancing and declining stocks (AD Ratio) to advancing and declining volume (AD volume).\n\nThe Arms index, also called the short-term trading index (TRIN) is a technical analysis indicator that compares the number of advancing and declining stocks (AD Ratio) to advancing and declining volume (AD volume). It's used to gauge overall market sentiment.\n\nRichard W. Arms, Jr. invented the TRIN in 1967, and it measures the relationship between market supply and demand. It serves as a predictor of future price movements in the market, primarily on an intraday basis. It does this by generating overbought and oversold levels, which indicate when the index (and the majority of stocks in it) will change direction.\n\nImage by Sabrina Jiang \u00a9 Investopedia\u00a02021\n\n\ufeffTRIN=Advancing\u00a0Stocks/Declining\u00a0StocksAdvancing\u00a0Volume/Declining\u00a0Volumewhere:Advancing\u00a0Stocks=Number\u00a0of\u00a0stocks\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0higherDeclining\u00a0Stocks=Number\u00a0of\u00a0stocks\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0lowerAdvancing\u00a0Volume=Total\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0advancing\\begin{aligned} &\\text{TRIN}\\ =\\ \\frac{\\text{Advancing Stocks/Declining Stocks}}{\\text{Advancing Volume/Declining Volume}}\\\\ &\\textbf{where:}\\\\ & \\begin{aligned} \\text{Advancing Stocks}\\ =\\ &\\text{Number of stocks that are higher}\\\\ &\\text{on the day}\\end{aligned}\\\\ &\\begin{aligned} \\text{Declining Stocks}\\ =\\ &\\text{Number of stocks that are lower}\\\\ &\\text{on the day}\\end{aligned}\\\\ &\\begin{aligned} \\text{Advancing Volume}\\ =\\ &\\text{Total volume of all advancing}\\\\ &\\text{stocks}\\end{aligned}\\\\ &\\begin{aligned}\\text{Declining Volume}\\ =\\ &\\text{Total volume of all declining}\\\\ &\\text{stocks}\\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}\u200bTRIN=Advancing\u00a0Volume/Declining\u00a0VolumeAdvancing\u00a0Stocks/Declining\u00a0Stocks\u200bwhere:Advancing\u00a0Stocks=\u200bNumber\u00a0of\u00a0stocks\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0higher\u200bDeclining\u00a0Stocks=\u200bNumber\u00a0of\u00a0stocks\u00a0that\u00a0are\u00a0lower\u200bAdvancing\u00a0Volume=\u200bTotal\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0advancing\u200b\u200b\ufeff\n\nTRIN is provided in many charting applications. To calculate by hand, use the following steps.\n\nThe Arms index seeks to provide a more dynamic explanation of overall movements in the composite value of stock exchanges, such as the NYSE or NASDAQ, by analyzing the strength andbreadthof these movements.\n\nAn index value of 1.0 indicates that the ratio of AD Volume is equal to the AD Ratio. The market is said to be in a neutral state when the index equals 1.0, since the up volume is evenly distributed over the advancing issues and the down volume is evenly distributed over the declining issues.\n\nMany analysts believe that the Arms Index\u00a0provides abullishsignal when\u00a0it's less than 1.0, since there's more volume in the average up stock than the average down stock. In fact, some analysts have found that the long-term equilibrium for the index is below 1.0, potentially confirming that there is a bullish bias to the stock market.\n\nOn the other hand, a reading of greater than 1.0 is typically seen as abearishsignal, since there's more volume in the average down stock than the average up stock.\n\nThe farther away from 1.00 the Arms Index value is, the greater the contrast between buying and selling on that day. A value that exceeds 3.00 indicates an oversold market and that bearish sentiment is too dramatic. This could mean an upward reversal in prices/index is coming.\n\nConversely, a TRIN value that dips below 0.50 may indicate an overbought market and that bullish sentiment is overheating.\n\nTraders look not only at the value of the indicator but also at how it changes throughout the day. They look for extremes in the index value for signs that the market may soon change directions.\n\nTRIN compares the number of advancing and declining stocks to the volume of both advancing and declining stocks. TheTick indexcompares the number of stocks making anuptickto the number of stocks making adowntick. The Tick Index is used to gauge intraday sentiment. The Tick Index does not factor in volume, but extreme readings still signal potentially overbought or oversold conditions.\n\nDon't confuse the TRIN index for the share price of Trinity Capital (TRIN).\n\nThe Arms Index has a few mathematical peculiarities that traders and investors should be aware of when using it. Since the index emphasizes volume, inaccuracies arise when there isn't as much advancing volume in advancing issues as expected. This may not be a typical situation, but it's a situation that can arise and couldpotentially make the indicator unreliable.\n\nHere are two examples of instances where problems may occur:\n\nOne way to solve this problem would be to separate the two components of the indicator into issues and volume instead of using them in the same equation. For instance, advancing issues divided by declining issues could show one trend, while advancing volume over declining volume could show a separate trend. These ratios are called the\u00a0advance/decline ratio\u00a0andupside/downside ratio, respectively. Both of these could be compared to tell the market's true story.\n\nInvestors use the TRIN indicator to gauge the overall sentiment of the market. A high TRIN indicates that falling stocks are trading at a greater volume than rising stocks, suggesting that the market is overall headed downwards. A low TRIN indicates that rising stocks have a greater volume than falling stocks. This index can be used to predict future price movements.\n\nThe Tick index measures relative market movements, similar to the TRIN. The Tick index measures the number of stocks trading on an uptick, compared to the number of stocks on a downtick. Unlike TRIN, it does not account for the trading volume.\n\nA TRIN index below 1.0 is usually a bullish sign, indicating that the market is advancing. However, it is important to understand the peculiarities of the TRIN formula because there are some circumstances where it can generate false signals.\n\nThe Arms Index, also known as the TRIN, is part of the galaxy of technical indicators used to measure and predict the movements of the stock market. This indicator reflects the market as a whole, and is used to predict when the overall sentiment of market participants is becoming bullish or bearish. As with other technical indicators, it is most effective when combined with other analytical tools.\n\nGoogle Finance. \"Trinity Capital Inc.\"",
