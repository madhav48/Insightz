  "term": "What Is a Venn Diagram? Meaning, Examples, and Uses",
  "definition": "A Venn diagram uses overlapping circles to graphically illustrate the traits that are shared and not shared by two or more sets of things being compared.\n\nA Venn diagram is a graphic that identifies the traits that two or more sets of things, concepts, or people share and don't share. Circles representing each trait overlap when they share traits. Circles that do not overlap have no common traits.\n\nThe Venn diagram was popularized by mathematician John Venn in the 1880s and is still widely used.\n\nVenn diagrams are useful for illustrating how different concepts or factors intersect with one another. They can show, at a glance, how things are similar or different and where and how they overlap.\n\nFor instance, in the diagram below we can see that while urban and rural areas have many different attributes, sports activities can be found in both.\n\nWhile there are many ways to organize a Venn diagram, they most often consist of overlapping circles, as shown above. Each circle by itself represents a \"set,\" which may be made up of ideas, concepts, numbers, or objects.\n\nWhen circles overlap or intersect, the subsets that are shared are known as a unionor intersection. Areas that don't overlap show the differences between sets, and a complement set refers to everything not shared by a particular set or subset.\n\nJohn Venn, an English mathematician and logician, popularized the diagram that bears his name. His work was influenced by Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, whose diagrams are known as Euler diagrams. Euler's diagrams also represent logical relationships but do not necessarily use all possible intersections of sets, which is a defining feature of Venn diagrams.\n\nVenn studied and taught logic andprobabilitytheory at Cambridge University, where he developed his method of using diagrams to illustrate the branch of mathematics known as set theory.\n\nIn 1866, Venn published a groundbreaking work, \"The Logic of Chance,\" which explained his frequency theory of probability, arguing that probability should be based on the frequency with which something can be predicted to occur over time.In another book, \"Symbolic Logic,\" Vennbuilt on and developed mathematician George Boole's theories onalgebra.This work helped him advance the concept of the Venn diagram.\n\nThe term Venn diagram did not appear until 1918, when Clarence Lewis, an American academic philosopher and the eventual founder of conceptual pragmatism, referred to the circular depiction as the Venn diagram in his book \"A Survey of Symbolic Logic.\"\n\nVenn diagrams depict how items relate to one another against an overall backdrop, universe, data set, or environment.\n\nA Venn diagram could be used, for example, to compare two companies in the same industry by illustrating the products both companies offer (where circles overlap) and the products that are exclusive to each company (outer circles).\n\nVenn diagrams are simple pictorial representations of the relationship that exists between two sets of things. Their ease of use led to their widespread popularity for sharing information in fields includingstatistics, linguistics, logic, education, computer science, and business.\n\nAs an example, a Venn diagram could distinguish between fruits and vegetables that come in red and/or orange colors. Below, we can see that there are orange fruits (circle B), such as persimmons and tangerines, while apples and cherries (circle A) come in red colors. Peppers and tomatoes come in both red and orange colors, as represented by the overlapping area of the two circles.\n\nYou might also draw a Venn diagram to help decide which of two cars to purchase. The Venn diagram below shows the features that are exclusive to each car and the features that both cars have. We see that Car A is a sedan that's powered by gasoline and gets 20 miles per gallon, while Car B is a hybrid that gets 40 miles per gallon and is a hatchback.\n\nThe shaded region where the two circles overlap shows the features that both cars have in common, which include four doors, a radio, Bluetooth capability, and airbags.\n\nDepending on which features are important to you, the Venn diagram shows clearly what each car has (and doesn't have).\n\nA Venn diagram in math can show how various sets of numerical data overlap with one another.\n\nFor example, if one circle represents every number between 1 and 25 and another represents every number between 1 and 100 that is divisible by 5, the overlapping area would contain the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25, while all the other numbers would be confined to their separate circles.\n\nA Venn diagram is read by observing all of the circles that make up the entire diagram. Each circle is its own item or data set. The portions of the circles that overlap indicate the areas that are in common among the different items while the parts that do not overlap indicate the unique traits of each item.\n\nVenn diagrams can use any number of circles (or any other shape) to show the differences and intersections of multiple sets, although the diagram may become unwieldy and hard to read when more than a few sets are included.\n\nVenn diagrams are an efficient way to express the relationship between items and the attributes they have in common. Since they help visualize the similarities and differences between limited sets of things, they are widely used in business, education, probability, logic, statistics, linguistics, and computer science.\n\nLibreText Mathematics. \"3.1.2: Venn Diagrams.\"\n\nResearch in History and Philosophy of Mathematics. \"Origins of the Venn Diagram,\" Page 112.\n\nEncyclopedia Britannica. \"John Venn.\"\n\nProject Gutenberg. \"The Logic of Chance, 3rd Edition.\"\n\nGoogle Books. \"Symbolic Logic.\"\n\nInternet Archive. \"A Survey of Symbolic Logic.\"",
