  "definition": "The term \"welfare state\" refers to a type of political system\u0326\u0326 in which a government plays a key role in the protection and promotion of the economic and social well-being of its citizens.\n\nThe provision of welfare is often rooted in the principles of equality of opportunity, equitable distribution of wealth, and public responsibility for those unable to avail themselves of the minimal provisions of a good life.Social Security, federally mandated unemployment insurance programs, andwelfare paymentsto people unable to work are all examples of the welfare state. Most modern countries practice some elements of what is considered the welfare state.\n\nThat said, the term is frequently used in a derogatory\u00a0sense to describe a state of affairs where the government creates incentives to access welfare benefits that are beyond reason, resulting in an unemployed person on welfare payments earning more than a struggling worker. The welfare state is sometimes criticized as being a \"nanny state\" in which adults are coddled and treated like children.\n\nAlthough fair treatment of citizens and a state-provided standard of living for the poor dates back further than the Roman Empire, the modern welfare states that best exemplify\u00a0the historical rise and fall of this concept are the U.K. and the United States. From the 1940s to the 1970s, the welfare state in the U.K.\u2014based on the Beveridge Report\u2014took hold, leading to a growth in the government to replace the services that were once provided by charities, trade unions, and the church.In the U.S., the groundwork for the welfare state grew out of theGreat Depressionand the massive price paid by the poor and the working poor during this period.\n\nThe U.K.'s system grew despite some spirited opposition byMargaret Thatcherin the 1980s, and it continues today although it frequently needs restructuring and adjustments to keep it from getting too unwieldily.The U.S. never went to the extent of the U.K., andRonald Reaganhad much more success than Thatcher in shrinking government.\n\nThe welfare state has become a target of derision. According to critics, under this system, the welfare of its citizens is the responsibility of the state. Some countries take this to mean offering unemployment benefits and base level welfare payments, while others take it much further withuniversal healthcare, free college, and so on.\n\nDespite most nations falling on a spectrum of welfare state activity, with few holdouts among the most developed nations, there is a lot of charged rhetoric when the term comes up in conversation.\n\nWhile it is true that the government is rarely the most cost-effective agent to deliver a welfare-oriented program, it is also true that the government is the only organization that can potentially care for all its citizens without being driven to do so as part of another agenda. Running a welfare state is fraught with difficulties, but it is also difficult to run a nation where large swaths of the population struggle to get the food, education, and care needed to better their personal situations.\n\nThe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)\u2014commonly known as food stamps\u2014is a federal program administered by states. This means that the amount an eligible individual or family receives is generally consistent across all states.\n\nSocial safety net programs have different participation limits. For cash assistance\u2014formally known asTemporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)\u2014the lifetime limit for benefits is 60 months.\n\nEligibility for welfare varies based on program. For most means-tested programs such as food stamps and cash assistance, individuals and families qualify based on income, assets, and households size. Other programs, like unemployment insurance, depend on the economic circumstances of potential participants.\n\nThe term \"welfare state\" refers to political systems in which a goverment undertakes policies and programs to maintain the well-being of residents and citizens. In common parlance, it is also used to denigrate initiatives that critics argue foster economic dependence.\n\nMost developed countries have social safety programs in place to ensure the welfare of constituents, for instance, unemployment insurance and nutrition assistance programs. However, these can often be targeted due to the politicization of welfare.\n\nGOV.UK., National Archives. \"The Beveridge Report and the Foundations of the Welfare State.\"\n\nNational Library of Medicine. \"The Deserving Poor, the Family, and the U.S. Welfare System.\"\n\nThe Guardian. \"Margaret Thatcher left a dark legacy that has still not disappeared.\"\n\nThe American Presidency Project. \"Ronald Reagan, 40th\u00a0President of the United States:\u00a01981 \u2010 1989; Address Before a Joint Session of the Congress Reporting on the State of the Union.\"\n\nCIA World Fact Book. \"Denmark.\"\n\nThe Federal Republic of Germany. \"Strong Welfare State.\"",
