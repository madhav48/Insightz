The IRS treats any inheritance with astepped-up valuation\u2014or a step-up basis. That means thecost basisis adjusted to the fair market value of the inherited property as of the date of death.\n\nUsing the stepped-up valuation methodology allowsheirsto minimizecapital gains taxes. The method also allows for a cleaner valuation process in terms of limiting the number of administrative tasks associated with the estate.\n\nAgeneration-skipping transfer taxis a transfer of money or property, either as an inheritance or a gift, to someone who is two or more generations after the grantor. The person who receives the inheritance or gift is called the skip person. While a skip person is often a grandchild, it could be anyone who\u2019s at least 37\u00bd\u00a0years younger than the grantor.\n\nThe generation-skipping transfer tax is imposed on gifts and inheritances that a skip person receives.
