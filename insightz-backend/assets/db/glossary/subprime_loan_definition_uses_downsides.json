  "definition": "Thomas J Catalano is a CFP and Registered Investment Adviser with the state of South Carolina, where he launched his own financial advisory firm in 2018.\u00a0Thomas' experience gives him expertise in a variety of areas including investments, retirement, insurance, and financial planning.\n\nA subprime loan is a type of loan offered at a rate above prime to individuals who do not qualify forprime-rateloans. Quite often subprime borrowers have been turned down by traditional lenders because of their low credit ratings or other factors that suggest they have a reasonable chance of defaulting on the debt repayment.\n\nWhen banks lend each other money to cover their reserve requirements, they charge each other the prime rate, an interest rate based on thefederal funds rateestablished by the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve Bank. As the Fed's website explains it, \"Although the Federal Reserve has no direct role in setting the prime rate, many banks choose to set their prime rates based partly on the target level of the federal funds rate\u2014the rate that banks charge each other for short-term loans\u2014established by the Federal Open Market Committee.\"\n\nTheprime ratehas fluctuated from a low of 2% in the 1940s to a high of 21.5% in the 1980s.At its Dec. 18, 2024Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)meeting, the Federal Reserve lowered the target range for the fed funds rate by 0.25%.This action was the result of the Federal Reserve's efforts to combat persistent inflation. Since the 1990s, the prime rate has typically been set to 300 basis points above the fed funds rate, translating to a prime rate of 7.5% based on the Fed's latest action, as of this writing.\n\nThe U.S. prime rate in January 2025\n\nThe prime rate plays a large role in determining the interest that banks charge their borrowers. Traditionally, corporations and other financial institutions receive rates equal or very close to the prime rate. Retail customers with good credit and strong credit histories who take out mortgages, small business loans, and car loans receive rates slightly higher than, but based on, the prime rate.Applicants with low credit scores or other risk factorsare offered rates by lenders that are significantly higher than the prime rate\u2014hence the term \u201csubprime loan.\u201d\n\nThe specific amount of interest charged on a subprime loan is not set in stone. Different lenders may not evaluate a borrower\u2019s risk in the same manner. This means a subprime loan borrower has an opportunity to save some money by shopping around. Still, by definition, all subprime loan rates are higher than the prime rate.\n\nAlso, borrowers might accidentally stumble into the subprime lending market by, for example, responding to an advertisement for mortgages when they actually qualify for a better rate than they are offered when they follow up on the ad. Borrowers should always check to see whether they qualify for a better rate than the one they are originally offered.\n\nThe higher interest rates on subprime loans can translate into tens of thousands of dollars in additional interest payments over the life of a loan.\n\nOn large-term loans, such as mortgages, the additional percentage points of interest often translate to tens of thousands of dollars worth of extra interest payments over the life of the loan. This can make paying off subprime loans difficult for low-income borrowers, as it did in the late 2000s. In 2007, high numbers of borrowers holding subprime mortgages began to default. Ultimately, this subprime meltdown was asignificant contributor to the financial crisisand the ensuingGreat Recession.As a result, several big banks got out of the subprime lending business. More recently, though, this hasstarted to change.\n\nWhile any financial institution could offer a loan with subprime rates, some lenders focus onsecond-chance loansand subprime loans with high rates. Arguably, these lenders give borrowers who have trouble getting low interest rates the ability to access capital to invest, grow their businesses, or buy homes.\n\nSubprime lending is often consideredpredatory lending, which involves giving borrowers loans with unreasonable rates, locking them into debt, or increasing their likelihood of defaulting. Nevertheless, getting a subprime loan may be a sensible option if the loan is meant to pay off debts with higher interest rates, such as credit cards, or if the borrower has no other means of obtaining credit.\n\nBorrowers who have been turned down for loans because of poor credit might jump at a subprime loan offer even if it has high interest rates or fees. Subprime loan interest rates are typically 8%-10% higher than rates for prime mortgages. Plus, subprime loans have higher upfront fees.\n\nPeople who might not otherwise qualify for loans can get the opportunity to purchase a home without having to wait. Plus, if they're able to make on-time mortgage payments, their credit scores can improve over time.If it's a significant change, they may be able to refinance the loan to a prime loan.\n\nAlthough subprime loans aren't as common as they were in the early 2000s, they are still possible to get. That said, subprime loans face more restrictions and regulations than they previously did.\n\nSubprime loans are a legitimate mortgage option for people who might otherwise not qualify for a mortgage. Although the interest rates and upfront fees are higher, it borrowers consistently make their mortgage payments, they can see an improvement to their credit scores.\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"FAQ's: What Is the Prime Rate, and Does the Federal Reserve Set the Prime Rate?.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. \"Bank Prime Loan Rate Changes: Historical Dates of Changes and Rates.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Press Release December 18, 2024: Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement.\"\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. \"RSA 399-B Statement of Finance Charges.\"\n\nFederal Reserve Board. \"Selected Interest Rates (Daily) - H.15.\"\n\nFederal Reserve History. \"Subprime Mortgage Crisis.\"\n\nExperian. \"The Pros and Cons of Subprime Mortgages.\"",
