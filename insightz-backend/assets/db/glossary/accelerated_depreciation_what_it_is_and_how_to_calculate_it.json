  "term": "Accelerated Depreciation: What It Is and How to Calculate It",
  "definition": "Accelerated depreciation is any method ofdepreciationused for accounting or income tax purposes that allows greater depreciation expenses in the early years of the life of an asset.\n\nAccelerated depreciation methods, such as double-declining balance (DDB), mean there will be higher depreciation expenses in the first few years and lower expenses as the asset ages. This is unlike thestraight-line depreciationmethod, which spreads the cost evenly over the life of an asset.\n\nAccelerated depreciation methods tend to align the recognized rate of anasset\u2019s depreciation with its actual use, although this isn\u2019t technically required. This alignment tends to occur because an asset is most heavily used when it\u2019s new, functional, and most efficient.\n\nBecause this tends to occur at the beginning of the asset\u2019s life, the rationale behind an accelerated method of depreciation is that it appropriately matches how the underlying asset is used. As an asset ages, it is not used as heavily, since it is slowly phased out for newer assets.\n\nUsing an accelerated depreciation method has financial reporting implications. Because depreciation is accelerated, expenses are higher in earlier periods than in later periods. Companies may utilize this strategy for taxation purposes, as an accelerated depreciation method will result in a deferment oftax liabilitiessinceincomeis lower in earlier periods.\n\nAlternatively, public companies tend to shy away from accelerated depreciation methods, asnet incomeis reduced in the short term.\n\nThedouble-declining balance (DDB)method is an accelerated depreciation method. After taking the reciprocal of theuseful lifeof the asset and doubling it, this rate is applied to the depreciable base\u2014also known as thebook value, for the remainder of the asset\u2019s expected life.\n\nFor example, an asset with a useful life of five years would have a reciprocal value of 1/5 or 20%. Double the rate, or 40%, is applied to the asset\u2019s current book value for depreciation. Although the rate remains constant, the dollar value will decrease over time because the rate is multiplied by a smaller depreciable base each period.\n\nThesum-of-the-years\u2019-digits (SYD)method also allows for accelerated depreciation. To start, combine all the digits of the expected life of the asset. For example, an asset with a five-year life would have a base of the sum of the digits one through five, or 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.\n\nIn the first depreciation year, 5/15 of the depreciable base would be depreciated. In the second year, only 4/15 of the depreciable base would be depreciated. This continues until year five depreciates the remaining 1/15 of the base.\n\nAccelerated depreciation methods usually align the recognized rate of an asset\u2019s depreciation with its actual use, but this isn\u2019t technically required. This alignment usually occurs because an asset is most heavily used when it\u2019s new, functional, and at its most efficient.\n\nThe rationale behind an accelerated depreciation method is that it appropriately matches how the asset is used. As an asset ages, it is not used as heavily\u2014it is slowly being phased out for newer assets.\n\nBecause depreciation is accelerated, expenses are higher in earlier periods compared to later periods. Companies may utilize this strategy for taxation purposes, because an accelerated depreciation method will result in deferred tax liabilities since income is lower in earlier periods.\n\nAccelerated depreciation refers to any depreciation method used for accounting or income tax purposes that allows greater depreciation expenses in an asset\u2019s early years. Accelerated depreciation methods mean higher depreciation expenses in the first few years and lower expenses as the asset gets older.",
